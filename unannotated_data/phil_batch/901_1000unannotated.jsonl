{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "12", "text": "But I think the reason why so many people ask me for responses to their typical questions is because they put people in a really weird spot"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "13", "text": "When someone comes to your door and asks you about what you think happens when you die, the situation gets awkward really fast"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "14", "text": "But why? Why are things so awkward"}

{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "16", "text": "There is something that one person knows that the other person doesnt know and the feeling of awkwardness is one person trying to find a politically correct way to break the news to them or avoid having the conversation"}

{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "26", "text": "There is a lot of argument against Descartes and his creation of this idea of objective vs formal reality"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "27", "text": "Many people wonder why there even needs to be a distinction and what basis he has for making this distinction"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "28", "text": "On one end he relegates the existence of ideas and makes them lesser than things that have finite formal reality, but on the other end he makes their existence greater than things with finite formal reality"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "29", "text": "Another common objection is that it is a huge logical leap to arbitrarily say that beings with finite formal reality cannot possibly conceive of something with infinite objective reality"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "30", "text": "But the largest disagreement is probably when he says that we all have an innate idea of this being known as God as being infinite"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "31", "text": "Why is that necessarily the case? Many cultures throughout history have vehemently believed in a creator that in itself was not infinite"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "32", "text": "If this idea of an infinite entity is TRULY innate, which is what Descartes NEEDS to prove, why do these people not have it?\n\nThe common explanation is that they dont"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "33", "text": "The only people that do are people that were born into a society or culture that regularly plants the seeds in the heads of their young that an infinite creator exists"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "34", "text": "That constant reinforcement shades the direction of their thoughts, so although everyone around Descartes may have had this conception from a very young age, it might not be inherent"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "35", "text": "This may be the chickens coming home to roost"}
{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "36", "text": "This may be a manifestation of what we talked about earlier where when the bulk of society believes something that we should pick our battles and sometimes just go along with it"}

{"ep_id": "30", "sent_id": "38", "text": "One thing is for certainwhich as we continue our journey through philosophy we will realizeis that if he had fought this battle, if he had questioned whether the idea of an infinite God TRULY was innateit wouldve been a lonely, depressing road ahead"}
