{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "3", "text": "I dont think most people disagree that it seems likely that there is an absolute truth about each individual facet of everything that exists"}

{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "5", "text": "That concept is pretty straightforward in itself"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "6", "text": "Its when humans start talking about truth that things get crazy"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "7", "text": "Its what that truth is, and what makes it true when viewing it through the lens of a human that is the tough question"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "8", "text": "And its because were all viewing the same exact scene, unfolding out in front of us, but were all viewing it through a different filter and from a different vantage point"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "9", "text": "Now because of that, and this is something that is a big issue in philosophy, we might have to be willing to accept as humans that we cant arrive at truth"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "10", "text": "We might have to accept that as beings living on this planet, whatever you think we are, that discovering the absolute truth about everything or anything isnt a function of our existence"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "11", "text": "We might not have the equipment to find the truth"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "12", "text": "I guess it kind of depends on what you believe in, if you think we evolved from monkeys, you might not think our brains are designed to necessarily understand the fabric of space and time you might think our brains are designed to socialize, pick bananas and reproduce"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "13", "text": "On the other hand, if you think we are spiritual beings, programmed into this body by God or some creator, maybe you think god didnt put us here to understand how he did everything, he put us here to follow a certain set of behavioral restrictions and to be judged"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "14", "text": "I mean, whatever you think, the key thing to note is that its never been obvious to us what the truth was"}
{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "15", "text": "And because of that ambiguity, truth has always been a subjective term"}

How could you know that THAT truth isnt just another step on your journey towards arriving at the truth?

{"ep_id": "19", "sent_id": "36", "text": "I want you to think about the second example of truth in our episode today, Al Ghazali"}

{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "1", "text": "One of the hallmarks of philosophy is looking at one question from multiple different angles"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "2", "text": "Its not enough to think about stuff for a while and come to what seems like a reasonable conclusion, and then call it a life"}

{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "6", "text": "Thats right, by the end of the show today youre going to know the answer to the question: Does God exist? Just Kidding, obviously"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "7", "text": "But I would like to talk about some common ways that people think about this question and address them"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "8", "text": "For about a year of my life, most of my free time was spent reading proofs of Gods existence or non-existence"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "9", "text": "Not just philosophical proofs, although I read a lot of those, I read forums, I read articles, I read hateful YouTube comments, I read books"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "10", "text": "I called it my spiritual quest, you know, there are many philosophers weve talked about that come to question what they think about the nature of existence and the world they live in, and they go on some sort of spiritual journey where they find themselves, I believe I compared it to John Travoltas mid life crisis in the movie Wild Hogs"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "11", "text": "Well this year that I spent, was my Wild Hogs when it came to the question of: does God exist? And what I saw was, like most things, the vast majority of the people are emphatically on one side or the other"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "12", "text": "And one of the main lines of thinking I saw from the Atheist side of things, not from the philosophers, but from the average person walking around on the street, was they were proving God didnt exist or making fun of the idea of a God existing based on a very limited view of what God is"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "13", "text": "These people are born into a world where monotheism rules the day when it comes to religion, people are given a code of ethics to follow and if they do a good job theyre given VIP treatment in the afterlife"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "14", "text": "Thats the world theyre born into"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "15", "text": "Thats what God is to them, because thats the only concept theyve ever been introduced to because theyve never studied it, and they call it a life"}

{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "17", "text": "Well it isnt that simple"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "18", "text": "Just like when philosophers use words like virtue and good and truth, and when they say those words they mean something very different based on who is saying them, because the individual definitions of them change, the word God is describing a concept that changes based on who is saying it"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "19", "text": "How ridiculous would it be to think that when Plato talked about God he had the same concept in his mind as a modern day Christian or Jew, he lived hundreds of years before Jesus supposedly walked the earth"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "20", "text": "It is beyond the unfair categorization of words"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "21", "text": "See, whenever we say anything, even words like Justice and God, to bring it full circle, were categorizing them"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "22", "text": "That is the object of language, to convey a specific idea"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "23", "text": "Language wouldnt work very well if words were like what they are in Hawaii, where one word means twelve different things"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "24", "text": "But language runs into problems when trying to define or categorize something like God"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "25", "text": "God is infinite to Maimonides"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "26", "text": "Maimonides repeatedly says God is indefinable or other similar things"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "27", "text": "The way around this, what he thinks is that its impossible for us to say what God IS, we can only say what God is not"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "28", "text": "One time I was randomly walking down the road and a mother duck and about seven baby ducklings were walking in a line across the road and a couple people were really impatient, they honked their horns and swerved around them, so I went into the road and tried to hurry the ducks up across the road and I held my hand up to the next car that was waiting like Im directing traffic or something and when the ducks crossed the person rolled down their window to me and said Youre so benevolent! and I was like Thank You! at least I think thats what he said to me"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "29", "text": "So, Im benevolent for helping the ducks, but is calling God benevolent at that point fair at all? To put Gods benevolence on the same level as mine for helping the ducks is ridiculous to Maimonides"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "30", "text": "What he draws from this is that anything the Old Testament says about God is a metaphor"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "31", "text": "To think its the truth is naive; you cant actually categorize God with words"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "32", "text": "In fact, outside of understanding what it says in the Torah as a metaphorical representation of God, there are only two other ways you can accurately say anything about God"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "33", "text": "One, is by what is known as negative theology or a concealed negation"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "34", "text": "You cant talk about what God is, the only thing you can talk about is what God isnt"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "35", "text": "If we were saying that God is benevolent, that would be wrong because we use that same word to describe me with the ducks, instead we would say God is not merciless"}
{"ep_id": "20", "sent_id": "36", "text": "We can only say what we know he is not"}
