{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "5", "text": "Really, its not something to be ashamed of"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "6", "text": "We are creatures programmed for survival, and a fear of death is a great way for us to stay away from activities that might get us killed"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "7", "text": "But ever since weve gathered together and built these fortresses that we call cities and have had an unprecedented level of safety, that fear of death becomes much less useful than it once was"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "8", "text": "The paradigm to strive for now, is to be a person that can appease that fear of death"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "9", "text": "To achieve that level of tranquility that civilization SHOULD provide for people"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "10", "text": "This was the task of all of the various schools of the Hellenistic Age, Stoicism , Epicureanism , Skepticism , Cynicism , people have been experiencing this fear for a long time"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "11", "text": "But when were talking about going against processes in the brain that are as deeply ingrained as a fear of death, that task of quelling it becomes much easier said than done"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "12", "text": "Some would even say impossible"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "13", "text": "This fear of death is present at a different level in everyone, and for a guy like Michel de Montaigne, it was probably much worse than any of us"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "14", "text": "One of the things I love about Montaigne is that there is a level of disclosure and honesty in his writing that you dont find with many other philosophers and it gives him a very unique feel"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "15", "text": "One of the things he discloses, one of the things he is most open about is this fear of death that troubled him for a giant portion of his life"}
{"ep_id": "24", "sent_id": "16", "text": "He said:\n\nWith such frequent and ordinary examples passing before our eyes, how can we possibly rid ourselves of the thought of death and of the idea that at every moment it is gripping us by the throat? \n\n But that all changed with a single traumatic experience"}

{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "10", "text": "Would you want him to be cunning and sneaky like a fox, to be able to always stay one step ahead of other rulers?

{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "11", "text": "Well in the 1600s a man named Thomas Hobbes asked himself that question too, and the animal he chose, was a Leviathan"}
{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "12", "text": "Now, for anyone unfamiliar, the Leviathan is an animal from mythology, it is known as monstrous and terrifying, kind of like the alpha-predator of the ocean"}

{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "22", "text": "Hobbes says you may not understand why the laws are put in place, but because you benefit from the fruits of society, you should follow the laws of the sovereign because they are meant to keep the peace, they are meant to prevent us from declaring war on each other"}

{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "25", "text": "Once we are in this social contract, once we have established that self-preservation is the only thing that we can really draw a moral compass from, Hobbes says that because we are reasoning creatures, that if we use our ability to reason and think about what behavior would yield the greatest quality of self-preservation, we naturally arrive at certain principles"}

{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "27", "text": "There are many earlier and later interpretations of natural law, but Hobbes is unique in that they are so closely tied to his social contract"}
{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "28", "text": "The idea is simple: if the main goal is self-preservation, then any act that is destructive to yourself in any way in the long term, is bad"}
{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "29", "text": "Any act that is truly helpful to you, is good"}
{"ep_id": "26", "sent_id": "30", "text": "These good and bad actions are not always immediately evident to us, but Hobbes says these things are known innately by all and if we use our ability to reason well; Natural Law is ultimately what follows as a set of fundamentals to live by"}
