{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "1", "text": "One of my favorite things to ask people and, to me, one of the most fascinating things to hear people talk about is the moment they knew they had found the infallible truth about life and the infinitely enormous universe that we live in"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "2", "text": "There is usually a moment in their lifeits a little like the JFK assassinationor 9/11everybody knows where they were and what they were doing when they heard the newswell I think being one of the lucky few that has the nature of existence revealed to them has to rank AT LEAST as high as those events"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "3", "text": "I mean, its pretty huge! People have ALL different ways that this happens to them"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "4", "text": "For whatever reason, theyre chosen out of the 7 billion people and growing on this planet for God to breach the strict protocol of never revealing himself so that he can have some kind of direct correspondence with them"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "5", "text": "You know, hell directly speak with them sometimes, people talk about having conversations with godmaybe sometimes hes not really in a talking mood so he does something likemove the drapes and then the person infers that God moved the drapes, so that means I have to go outsidebut not physically outsidehe means outside this BOX Im living inthis box of sin and deceit"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "6", "text": "A couple Mormons that came to my door one time said that the moment THEY knew WAS direct communication, but it was more in the form of God giving them certain feeling states when they think about big decisions in their lifeor by giving them goosebumpsthe all powerful creator of the universe was communicating with them by making their hair stand up on end"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "7", "text": "Another one of these interesting examples One of my many step grandmothers over the years once told me a storyapparently one day her cat, who was SEVERELY overweight somehow got theyou know those ventilation grates in the floor that you can have in a two story house? well apparently she forgot to put it back covering the hole in the ground one time and her morbidly obese cat went down inside of the ventilation shaft and got stucklike he got wedged in thereit was like some parody of mission impossible 7 Tom Cruise gains 50 pounds and has one last go at trying to save the world but its not working out for him too well"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "8", "text": "Anyway so my step grandma hears the cat meowing and she goes to the kitchen where she keeps her bible, because who doesnt like to cook and study the word simultaneously and she begins praying and all of a sudden and when she tells this story she is incredibly emotional, so she obviously believes that it happened or it DID happen GOLDEN TUBES OF LIGHT RAIN DOWN FROM THE SKY there was a chorus of angelsshe told me she actually saw heaven and Jesus descended from the ceiling right through the ventilation shaft and he said USE THE STEPLADDER granted when she tells the story he doesnt say it like hes a genie he says it in a comforting voicethen he disappears and she goes and gets her mom, because she was young at the time and they use the step ladder to reach up into the ventilation system from downstairs and they manage to get the cat out"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "9", "text": "and how lovely is that you guys? Jesus HAS to be busy theres a lot of tragedy in the worldi read once that something like 100 people die EVERY SECOND many of which from preventable diseases or violent actsi mean i cant fathom how special it must feel to be the cat he saved instead of dealing with the rest of the 7 billion pieces in the chess game he is playing all over the world"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "10", "text": "To my ex-step grandmother it was a miracle, and she said from that moment on there has never been any doubt, she and god have conversations all the time and she knows that if anything bad ever happens to her, God is going to get her out of it"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "11", "text": "Well I love hearing these stories and the guy were gonna talk about today has a really great one, albeit not as sensational as my ex-step grandmas and its a great story because he spent SO MUCH of his life as a skeptic of Christianity and then he has this experience and he is INSTANTLY certain of everythinghe INSTANTLY knows the infallible truth"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "12", "text": "Can you guys REALLY blame me for being so interested in these stories? I mean if you start with the knowledge we are born withits pretty incredible that ONE experience not only tells you that a supernatural God exists but that THAT god is a single godthat is interested in human affairs and offers people personal salvation if they follow his set of rules but not only thatALSO that this supernatural god manifested himself on planet earth and sacrificed himself, to himself to save us from himself or however the popular saying goes if were talking about Christianity"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "13", "text": "I mean these things are not just a given when youre born into this world, and I find it endlessly fascinating to hear when others are given experiences like this"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "14", "text": "Now, Saint Augustine was one of these lucky few and if youre looking at figures in the history of philosophy he kind of gets a bad rap hes sometimes portrayed as the mommas boy of philosophybut I think thats kind of inaccurate and really its just trying to point out that his mom was a semi famous figure herself"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "15", "text": "you guys would know her better as Saint Monica"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "17", "text": "the town of Santa Monica in Southern California is named after herits easy to imagine being a child and feeling an enormous amount of pressure to conform to the same religious beliefs as your parents and fearing that if you dont you wont be accepted by themplus if its a RULE in their house that youre GOING to go to church every Sunday if youre living under my roofyour choice as a child becomes either to believe and to become a Christian or to be COMPLETELY antisocial and against all these people at all the various church functions people who are usually INCREDIBLY nice and worthy of respect"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "18", "text": "My point isthis is a modern example of how someone might feel pressure from their parents and family to believe in something and it might lead them to accept the first thing that is presented to them and work out all the details later simply by virtue of this peer pressure"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "19", "text": "Well one AMAZING thing about Saint Augustine is that he DIDNT do that, he remained unsure for many of his formative years and he did it in the face of Saint Monica"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "20", "text": "Once he established that God gets all the credit for timethen he started to wonder what it is exactlyand how do you measure it? He sets the stage for a while in his Confessions and he really gets this state of confusion that hes in across:\n\nMy soul speaks with truth when it confesses to you that I do measure time"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "21", "text": "Is it the case then Lord, my god that I perform the act of measuring but do not know what I am measuring? I measure the motion of a body in time"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "22", "text": "Is it the case that I do not measure time itself?\n\nMost of us measure time in terms of past, present and future"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "23", "text": "But Augustine makes the case that the way we think of the concepts of past, present and future are wrong in fact nothing exists in REALITY except for the present"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "24", "text": "The past has already happened and doesnt exist anymore and the future hasnt happened yet, so can it really be said to exist? He thought the concepts of past and future are really just human constructs to make sense of the world around us he said:\n\nIt is inaccurate to say, there are three tenses of time: past, present and future, though it might properly be said, there are three tenses of times: the present of past things, the present of present things, the present of future things"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "25", "text": " These are three realities in the mind, but nowhere else as far as I can see, for the present of past things is memory, the present of present things is attention, and the present of future things is ex[expectation"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "26", "text": "If we are allowed to put it that way, I do see three tenses or times, and admit that they are three"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "27", "text": "He goes on and describes the way that the human brain measures time:\n\nIt is in you, my mind that I measure time"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "28", "text": "Do not interrupt me, or rather do not allow yourself to be interrupted by the thronging of your impressions"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "29", "text": "It is in you, I say that I measure time"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "30", "text": "As things pass by they leave an impression in you"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "31", "text": "This impression remains after the things have gone into the past, and it is this impression which I measure in the present, not the things which in their passage caused the impression"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "32", "text": "It is this impression which I measure when I measure time"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "33", "text": "Therefor, either this itself is time, or else I do not measure time at all"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "34", "text": "What hes saying is Time is nothing in reality"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "35", "text": "It only exists in relation to the human brains way that it perceives reality"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "36", "text": "Time is an illusion created by our minds to make sense of the world around us"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "37", "text": "This was incredibly ahead of its timeand he sums it up with a great quote here:\n\nWhat is true of the poem as a whole is true equally of its individual stanzas and syllables"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "38", "text": "The same is true of the whole long performance, in which this poem may be a single item"}
{"ep_id": "16", "sent_id": "39", "text": "The same thing happens in the entirety of a persons life, of which all his actions are parts; and the same in the entire sweep of human history, the parts of which are individual human lives"}

{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "2", "text": "How would you spend your time? This isnt just me being dramaticREALLY try to put yourself in that situation and ask yourselfwhat would be important to you in that moment?\n\nBoethius was a medieval neo-platonist philosopher who found himself in that moment"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "3", "text": "He actually had a pretty good standing in the worldconsidering he was living in a society that was growing increasingly corrupt and intolerantthe Roman Empire was crumbling heading towards where in modern times we have the luxury of knowing where it eventually would go but the people of the time didnt know"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "4", "text": "And the entire peninsula of Italy was controlled by a group of wonderful gentlemen known as the Ostrogoths"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "5", "text": "Let me tell you about who Boethius was working for"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "6", "text": "The Ostrogoths were led by a guy named Theoderic the Great"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "7", "text": "Just to get an idea of the types of moves this guy would pull in the interest of gaining and sustaining power let me tell you about how he took control of Italy in the first place"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "8", "text": "He was fighting an army led by a guy named Odoacer"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "9", "text": "Theodoric wins a couple battlesJUST SO THAT ODOACER gets on his back foot a little bitand right when hes in this place of vulnerabilitya bishop acts as a mediator between the two leaders and arranges a negotiation for a peace treaty"}

{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "12", "text": "It says in a text called the Anonymous Valesianusthat right after Theoderic kills him:\n\nThat same day, all of Odoacers army who could be found anywhere were killed by order of Theoderic, as well as all of his family"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "13", "text": "[44] Odoacers wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "14", "text": "Theoderic exiled Odoacers son Thela to Gaul, but when he attempted to return to Italy Theoderic had him killed"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "15", "text": "This guy is the RULER of everything"}

{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "19", "text": "But I think the reference is a little too obscureand it really doesnt matter"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "20", "text": "Well Boethius would say that we ALL need to call the problem gambling hotline"}
{"ep_id": "17", "sent_id": "21", "text": "But not because were playing kitty cat slot machine too muchits because we share the same delusional expectation of nothing but good fortune in our everyday lives"}

{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "7", "text": "Philosophy, in so many ways, is like the process of starting a maintaining a fire"}

{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "12", "text": "We talked for a long time on this show about the Presocratics"}
{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "13", "text": "Now, none of these guys had ideas that held up to scrutiny for very long, I mean sure we still talk about people like Heraclitus and Parmenides but their ideas were more landmarks of thought than philosophical endgames"}
{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "14", "text": "But these Presocratics were incredibly important nonetheless, if for no other reason than they began the discourse that was necessary"}
{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "15", "text": "They are the sparks that started the fire"}
{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "16", "text": "Yeah, one spark may pop up and just instantly fade away, not starting the big fire, but we needed people like Thales to exist"}
{"ep_id": "18", "sent_id": "17", "text": "We needed someone to look around them and say, I think everything is made of water"}
