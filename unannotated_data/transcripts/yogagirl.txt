Welcome to Yoga Girl Daily and happy Friday. It's Friday today! We've made it through our work week. We're almost at the weekend, so it's time for Feel-Good Friday and a practice that makes us feel really good. Today, I actually have something boring but fun in mind. Depending on where you kind of sit on the spectrum of this, you might feel that this is like a total drag and not at all something that you actually bring attention to in your day-to-day life. Maybe you're already presently doing this, and this is just going to affirm something that you're already doing, or a practice you already have. Today we're going to take a look at our finances! What? What does that have to do with feeling good? Actually, more than we think. Today I want you to reflect on something that you want to save up for, something that you wish you could purchase, an investment you wish you could make, but you're not quite there yet.

It can be something super small. It can be something really, really big. It can be a long-term thing, short term thing. But I want you to actually reflect on something that you're aiming for in that material sense. If it's a little upgrade you want to make in your home, if it's something you want to buy, a gift you want to give yourself or to someone else, a trip, you want to take, an experience, you want to have, a training you want to do, something that has to do with your personal development. Whatever it is, I want you to really define it. Figure out exactly how much this thing that you want is going to cost you, and then today, look over your finances and take the first step toward beginning to save for that experience. Now, I am not the kind of person who naturally likes to deal with financial things.

I'm very bad at saving money. I'm very bad of making a plan for things that I want, but I found that making myself commit to this practice, and not every day that I'm obsessing about my finances every day, but that I have the practice of looking over where I'm at, looking at the goals I might have in life in terms of things I want to expand on, or usually for me, it's an experience I want to give myself. It's a trip I want to take with my family, or it's something, a training I want to do. It's something more of an experience than a thing, but maybe for you it's a physical thing, something you actually want to spend money on and purchase. Maybe it's a need in your life, something you know you actually need to upgrade, a fix, something that's missing, right? So taking the first step to actually beginning to consciously save for that specific thing.

It puts us in alignment with the energy of drawing in abundance to make that thing happen. So it's not just this boring thing we do where we look over our budget and our savings account, but it's also a very spiritual practice of telling the universe, Hey, I want to manifest this thing. Hey, I want to align myself with drawing this energy into my life. And to do that, yeah, we have to be mindful of how we spend our money and we have to consciously save to make it happen. So get really clear on what are you saving for? And if you're like, Oh, I have nothing. I have no clue. There's nothing specific that I want. Take a moment to sit down and meditate on that. Are you sure? Or are you just kind of mindlessly spending your money as you go with nothing left?

At the end of the day? Maybe you have a long-term plan or maybe you should have a long-term plan for the type of life that you want way in the future. We all know that little bits go a long way. So saving a little something every month adds up to a lot at the end of the year. So perhaps what you're planning for or for this practice today, it's more about a long-term thing than a short term thing. Maybe you don't even have a savings account. Today would be a really good day to take the steps toward making that happen. Because trust me, when I say we want to be mindful and conscious and present with how we are spending our money, money is energy. How we are saving our money. Money is energy. So what are you preserving? What are you consciously caring for and what are you building for in your life?

So today we start saving for something special. Get really clear on what it is. If you don't have a savings account, I literally have a little piggy bank at home where I put everyday whenever my husband empties his pockets or we have any cash left over. All of it goes in the piggy bank. And I've been doing that for years. I'm pretty sure there's a small fortune hiding in that little pig right now. So remembering that little, little, little things with time, things that we don't even notice that we're saving actually can make a massive difference with time. So start that savings account or consciously begin to save. Get clear with your budget and how you're spending money in a month. Maybe there's something you can cut out to make space for saving for this wonderful thing you want to experience in your life. And let's do that today. Trust me when I say you're going to feel good at the end of this because you're going to have clarity and you're going to be working towards something very special for yourself. So an awesome way to end our work week and transition into the weekend. I hope you feel really good all weekend long. Yoga Girl Daily will be back on Monday.
