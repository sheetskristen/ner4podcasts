{"id": 53333, "text": "Everything else you losefive bucksyour wifeyour phoneits immediately evident to you that youve lost ityou know youre getting in your pajamaspat down your pockets and say OH NO! i left my phone at Applebees!when you lose your SELF thoughyou could go months or even YEARS without even realizing it!\nThis is why its a particularly nefarious situation to be inyou might not even realize that youre in itsee to Kierkegaard, most people living todayprobably in the upwards of 90% of people that are alive at any given timeare not actually being true to their selveslike we talked about last timea lotta people are losta lotta people find themselves either lost in the finiteyou know conferring their identity onto social conventions or whatever culture happened to fall into their lap when they were bornor lost in the infinitestuck in a state of analysis paralysis about the truly infinite possibilities that they can choose from and never really acting on one", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 53334, "text": "And as we were talking about last timetruly being a self requires you to have the realization that yeah there are an infinite number of things I can do, but it also requires you to actually make a choice and act on one that corresponds with who you truly are", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 53335, "text": "See, when we find ourselves in this balancing act between the twothe finite and the infinite as Kierkegaard calls themwe experience what he calls a state of dizziness dizziness caused by the fact that we look at the sheer magnitude of possibilities we have coupled with the fact that eventuallywe gotta choose one of them", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 53336, "text": "As you can probably imagine, our heads get filled with all of these questionswe start catastrophizingwhat if Im wrong? what if this is a huge mistake? what if I wake up when Im 60 a retired Navy Admiral with a prosthetic hip and realize I did everything all wrong??

{"id": 53340, "text": "See its really important to make this part of Kierkegaards thinking clearat the risk of sounding redundantwhat hes saying is that anxiety is the reaction to the idea that you have freedom to choose from millions of options but you have to eventually choose one and act on it", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

{"id": 53354, "text": "He said:\nWhat I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I must knowwhat matters is to find a purposeto find a truth that is true for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and dieThis is what my soul thirts for as the African desert thirsts for water", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

{"id": 53357, "text": "You knowfor so long in philosophy wed concerned ourselves with trying to use reason or our senses to try to find some sort of objective TRUTHS about the universe that we live inarguing the whole way about what the most reliable means of doing so is", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 53358, "text": "But as weve learned over the course of 80 episodes or so is that since antiquity no matter how brilliant of a person is trying to take on this taskobjective truth is a very slippery thingnot only do we not know if its possible to attain, but would we know the truth if we saw it? Would it bring us any sort of enlightenment when it comes to what it means to be a human being?\nSee a huge reason WHY Kierkegaard does so much work talking about these things likethe process of how we make choices, how important it is to take action on those choices, the freedom of our will that we all possessthe reason he talks about this so much is that he is rejecting the notion that Hegel had just laid outthat ultimately our choices are mostly a byproduct of whereever we happened to be born within the framework of that historical process of change", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 53359, "text": "Kierkegaard is trying to make the case that the choices we make are free choices, and that we need to remain vigilant in keeping an inventory of ourselves because these choices are OUR responsibilitynot some manifistation of something out of our control", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
