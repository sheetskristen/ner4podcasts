{"episode_1": {"date": "2014-4-24", "text": "Posted on April 24, 2014\nEpisode 20 Transcript\n\nThis is the full transcript of Podcast Episode 20, Two Medieval Approaches to God.\u00a0\n\nOne of the hallmarks of philosophy is looking at one question from multiple different angles. It\u2019s not enough to think about stuff for a while and come to what seems like a reasonable conclusion, and then call it a life. You can\u2019t do that. Our thoughts about any subject should be an evolution. The subject today is a topic we\u2019ve danced around quite a bit; we\u2019ve covered little pieces of it, but today we\u2019re going to talk about it more. That\u2019s right, by the end of the show today you\u2019re going to know the answer to the question: Does God exist? Just Kidding, obviously. But I would like to talk about some common ways that people think about this question and address them.\n\nFor about a year of my life, most of my free time was spent reading proofs of God\u2019s existence or non-existence. Not just philosophical proofs, although I read a lot of those, I read forums, I read articles, I read hateful YouTube comments, I read books. I called it my spiritual quest, you know, there are many philosophers we\u2019ve talked about that come to question what they think about the nature of existence and the world they live in, and they go on some sort of spiritual journey where they find themselves, I believe I compared it to John Travolta\u2019s mid life crisis in the movie Wild Hogs. Well this year that I spent, was my Wild Hogs when it came to the question of: does God exist? And what I saw was, like most things, the vast majority of the people are emphatically on one side or the other. And one of the main lines of thinking I saw from the Atheist side of things, not from the philosophers, but from the average person walking around on the street, was they were \u201cproving\u201d God didn\u2019t exist or making fun of the idea of a God existing based on a very limited view of what God is. These people are born into a world where monotheism rules the day when it comes to religion, people are given a code of ethics to follow and if they do a good job they\u2019re given VIP treatment in the afterlife. That\u2019s the world they\u2019re born into. That\u2019s what \u201cGod\u201d is to them, because that\u2019s the only concept they\u2019ve ever been introduced to because they\u2019ve never studied it, and they call it a life. Pathetic fairy tale, meant to keep humans in line, God doesn\u2019t exist. Well it isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nJust like when philosophers use words like virtue and good and truth, and when they say those words they mean something very different based on who is saying them, because the individual definitions of them change, the word \u201cGod\u201d is describing a concept that changes based on who is saying it. How ridiculous would it be to think that when Plato talked about God he had the same concept in his mind as a modern day Christian or Jew, he lived hundreds of years before Jesus supposedly walked the earth. Some of these people get so caught up in thinking \u201cI\u2019m so smart. I realize that snakes can\u2019t actually talk and that a guy didn\u2019t build a giant ship and corral two of every species on the ship while God killed everyone else on the planet, I know that\u2019s just a story.\u201d They get so caught up in that phase that they quit, they don\u2019t look at it any deeper; they don\u2019t think about the underlying concepts and whether they have merit. They don\u2019t think about the fact that maybe they just disagree with the medium its being communicated through.\nJust think about something for a second. Just on the concept of God, just on this show we\u2019ve already talked about several definitions of the concept. We\u2019ve talked about God being the thing, whatever it is, that brought this cosmos, into existence. Nothing more. Not interested in whether you said a bad word yesterday, not interested in whether you cheated on your test, to put a modern spin on it, the thing that caused the big bang. Later philosophers would say stuff like, the totality of all existence. Think of EVERYTHING that exists as a single unit, a unit that we and everything else in the universe are just aspects of. Couldn\u2019t that be considered God? If you don\u2019t think the big bang needed a cause, you certainly cant think it\u2019s pointless to entertain the possibility that it had one. We\u2019ve talked about the Stoics and their pantheistic view of God where god is the universe. You know, this thing, God, pervades all things. That thing which is difficult to describe with words, but it animates all things that possess life. We\u2019ve talked about Plotinus and his transcendent \u201cone\u201d. And guess what guys, we\u2019ve barely even gotten started with the concept of God. In fact, there are people, for each and every one of these philosophers that dedicate their lives to understanding what they meant by their concept of God. How they used reason to determine that something transcendent like that must exist if you logically keep going, well what comes after that? Now here\u2019s the point of all this. That\u2019s just \u201cwhat God is\u201d. That\u2019s just one very small part of what is laid out in these monotheistic religious texts. Just imagine being five years old and your parents take you to church for the first time, and you\u2019re really excited and instead of hearing the story about the man who built a giant ship and with God\u2019s wind at his back managed to conquer this unconquerable task, imagine if you started diving into Plato\u2019s Timaeus and started talking about the concept of a transcendent Good that can serve as a wind at your back. How many Sundays would you last before you started convulsing on the ground every Sunday morning like you\u2019re in Paranormal Activity, just so you can get out of going to church. I mean, the philosophical concept of each virtue goes equally as deep as the concept of God. People go to school for years to understand these things with any sort of depth, and like Averroes pointed out in the last episode, can we really expect the average person to go through that kind of schooling and understand the underlying concepts of religion in depth?\nHow many Sundays would pass before the pews start looking like a Pittsburgh Pirates game? Make no mistake. When philosophers talk about the concept of a God, they\u2019re thinking about it in a philosophical way. Today, we\u2019re going to be talking about probably the most famous proof of God\u2019s existence in the history of the world and it was put forward in the Middle ages where we\u2019re studying philosophy now. As we\u2019ve talked about before, monotheistic religions were powerful and in charge during the Middle Ages. As a result, most of the great thinkers were members of these monotheistic religions, and most of them used all their excess brainpower to make adjustments to Plato or Aristotle compatible with this monotheism. We\u2019ve seen Plotinus and his neo-platonism and Saint Augustine who was heavily influenced by him. We\u2019ve seen people like Philo of Alexandria trying to make Plato compatible with the Torah. Plato\u2019s philosophy really lent itself to being compatible with these new religions on the scene because of several things. He believed in a creator, he believed in the mind and body being separate from each other which then allows for the possibility of an immortal soul, many things were good about it. But Aristotle was a tougher sell to the church. We\u2019ve seen how the Islamic world and beyond worked to reconcile Aristotle\u2019s philosophy with Islamic theology. But what was going on in the West during that time?\n\nHave you Ever heard the phrase Greek East Latin West? Well it refers to this period of time that we\u2019re in right now. When the Roman Empire fell it broke into two parts, the very Greek Byzantine empire of the east and the Latin speaking west. Philosophy continued in both areas, but the more historically significant thing to talk about is what was happening ALL throughout Europe at the same time; it\u2019s what\u2019s known as Scholasticism. People use Scholasticism as a way to categorize philosophy of the time, you have a list of names known as Scholastic Philosophy. But really Scholasticism is just a method acquiring knowledge and learning that focuses heavily on dialectical reasoning. Dialectic is, if you remember, what Socrates used all the time. It\u2019s a style of doing philosophy that is conversational. Some people have opposing viewpoints and argue against each other being sure to use their tools of logic and reason as best they can, and hopefully at the end of the conversation they are a little closer to the truth. Well, one of the guys were talking about today is known as the father of Scholasticism. St. Anselm of Canterbury. And it\u2019s his argument for the existence of God which would later become known as the \u201cOntological Argument\u201d is the most famous proof of God\u2019s existence in history. But I want to give it to you guys in true dialectical fashion. I want you guys to have a conversation with St. Anselm and let him convince you that God exists. But first, I want to talk about the way Saint Anselm would have been thinking about things that exist. Simply put, he would\u2019ve broken things down into two types. Things that exist in our HUMAN understanding alone and things that exist in reality.\nSo lets think about some examples of these. What are some things that exist only in our human understanding? Well that would be anything that exists in our imagination that does not exist in reality. You can take your pick of the countless options. My little pony, Harry Potter, if you have an idea for an invention and it exists only in your mind because you haven\u2019t actually created it yet, these are all things that can be thought of as only having existence in relation to a human understanding them. Now if you had that invention manufactured; if you finally put pen to paper and got off of your parents futon and made that invention exist in reality, then it would not only exist in reality, it would still exist in your imagination too right? Well, at that point, your new invention falls into the category of most everything we see around us. A lawnmower, a vacuum cleaner, a Honda Civic with the muffler taken off of it, all of these things exist both in our imaginations and in reality. They also all make recording this podcast nearly impossible. But there is another class of things. Things that exist ONLY in reality and not in human understanding. For example, you see every once in a while some backpackers go deep into the Amazon rain forest and come across some new species of bird or insect. A species that was buried so deep in the Amazon jungle, no human knew that it existed, no human had understanding of it, no human had it in their imagination, but it still existed in reality despite the fact that a human didn\u2019t know about it. And there are all kind of examples of this. There may be galaxies and other bubbles of the multiverse that we have no idea exist yet, but they still exist in reality. Really, there could be things flying all around us all the time, beings existing in this same space whose existence really doesn\u2019t affect us at all, we can\u2019t see them, but they still exist.\n\nWell when we look at St. Anselm\u2019s famous proof of God\u2019s existence, we have to not let our individual biases of what the word God means get in the way. Anselm is proving the existence of the concept of God. He says himself:\n\u201cI began to ask myself whether there might be found a single argument which would require no other for its proof than itself alone; and alone would suffice to demonstrate that God truly exists, and that there is a supreme good requiring nothing else, which all other things require for their existence and well-being; and whatever we believe regarding the divine Being.\u201d\n\nNow focus on what he said there. All he\u2019s looking to do is prove that there is a supreme good that requires nothing else for its existence, which all other things require for their existence and well being. He could be equally proving the existence of Plotinus\u2019s transcendent \u201cone\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, which didn\u2019t have any human characteristics. What\u2019s important to point out, is that whenever you\u2019re proving that God exists or proving that anything exists for that matter, the most important thing you have to do is define terms, understand exactly what concept you have in your head that you\u2019re trying to describe with words and then prove. You need to provide a definition. And this is where St Anselm\u2019s Ontological argument begins and ends: Within his definition of what God is. He\u2019s setting up the idea here:\n\u201cTherefore, Lord, you who give knowledge of the faith, give me as much knowledge as you know to be fitting for me, because you are as we believe and that which we believe. And indeed we believe you are something greater than which cannot be thought. Or is there no such kind of thing, for \u201cthe fool said in his heart, \u2018there is no God'\u201d But certainly that same fool, having heard what I just said, \u201csomething greater than which cannot be thought,\u201d understands what he heard, and what he understands is in his thought, even if he does not think it exists. For it is one thing for something to exist in a person\u2019s thought and quite another for the person to think that thing exists.\u201d\n\nSo if you were having a conversation with St. Anselm, and you were one of these people who \u201cknow\u201d for a fact that God doesn\u2019t exist. He would start by setting a trap. He would say, Ok, I hear what you\u2019re saying. God doesn\u2019t exist. But lets just talk about what we religious people think of as God, would you agree that if, and only if, we\u2019re talking in theory here, if God existed, he would be the greatest thing you could ever imagine? If this thing existed, you as a mere human could never imagine something greater than him?\n\nNow, this seems perfectly reasonable. I think 99.9% of people would answer yes here. He\u2019s not saying that that thing exists yet, he\u2019s just defining what it is we\u2019re trying to prove the existence of. And he does so by describing it as \u201cThat than which nothing greater can be thought.\u201d If you\u2019re a Gnostic Atheist that claims to KNOW that God doesn\u2019t exist, you are quick to agree to this, because you see it as him just shining a light on this delusional concept he believes in. But it\u2019s a trap! He quickly makes that person feel a little stupid:\n\n\u201cThus even the fool is compelled to grant that something greater than which cannot be thought exists in thought, because he understands what he hears, and whatever is understood exists in thought. And certainly that greater than which cannot be understood cannot exist only in thought, for if it exists only in thought it could also be thought of as existing in reality as well, which is greater. If, therefore, that than which greater cannot be thought exists in thought alone, then that than which greater cannot be thought turns out to be that than which something greater actually can be thought, but that is obviously impossible. Therefore something than which greater cannot be thought undoubtedly exists both in thought and in reality.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something he does a lot in his writing, he writes in tongue twisters. It\u2019s like something Ron Burgandy would read before he goes on air. Good thing you got me to turn it into English. What he\u2019s saying is: By acknowledging that God is \u201cthe greatest thing you could ever imagine\u201d, you are acknowledging that God exists in your imagination, right? Again, most Atheists wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. They would say he ONLY exists in my imagination. Remember as we talked about before, there is a difference to St. Anselm between things that exist only in human understanding and things that exist in reality.\n\nThen Anselm would say, well certainly it\u2019s wonderful to be able to imagine things, you know, you can imagine that new invention of yours being made and on store shelves, but it\u2019s much greater when that invention exists in reality right? Most people would say yes here. Things that exist in reality are a little bit better than that same thing only existing in a day dream of ours.\n\nThen he goes in for the kill. He says, \u201cWell you agreed that God is \u2018the greatest thing you could ever imagine\u2019, and you say this \u201cGod\u201d that only exists in your imagination is the greatest thing you can ever imagine, but you can also imagine that that concept of God ALSO exists in reality, and wouldn\u2019t that be greater than ONLY existing in your imagination?\nWhat he\u2019s saying is: if we define god as the greatest thing you can ever imagine, then you CAN imagine that God exists, so therefore according to the definition you agreed to, he DOES exist. Something funny that I\u2019ve noticed as I\u2019ve been re-reading all of this Medieval Philosophy is that whenever one of these guys asserts something to be absolutely true, like they preface what they\u2019re saying with obviously or certainly, most of the time that\u2019s the portion of the argument that I take issue with. It\u2019s a weird psychological thing there, it\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to convince themselves of it.\nWhen most people hear this argument for the first time, if they\u2019re not invested in the outcome one way or another, I think they usually say, \u201cHmm. Sounds good, but I think there\u2019s something wrong with it, but I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is.\u201d For the record, this was my reaction when I first read it. I was incredibly open minded to either outcome. I ended up reading it a few more times and thinking about it for a week or so and I\u2019ll have you know, because I\u2019m very proud of myself for this, I independently arrived at the same conclusion that a guy named Immanuel Kant did centuries after Anselm. He wrote the most famous refutation of the Ontological argument, although my thoughts were no where near as justified as his and he did it with a much different educational upbringing than me, so Kant wins by far. But what he says is that the problem with this argument lies in two main areas, both of which are centered around that initial definition of God. God is \u201cthat than which nothing greater can be thought\u201d. Why necessarily is something that exists IN reality, greater, than something that doesn\u2019t exist in reality? That sounds a lot like a bias inherent in a human that values existing over not existing. The second thing Kant said is that Anselm is wrong to think of existence as a quality of something. You know, you can\u2019t think of a banana as being yellow, thin, calorie-dense and existing. Existence isn\u2019t the same as the quality of yellow. Without existence, the banana wouldn\u2019t have the ability to be yellow, thin, or calorie-dense. If we invented a new fruit and made existence a quality of it like being yellow or thin, what would happen? Let\u2019s say we believe in a fruit called a Washington. Washingtons are small little green fruits that are round and they grow on trees and they have an outer shell that you have to peel off to get to the fruit, oh yeah and they exist. Based on our definition, if you thought that Washingtons don\u2019t exist you\u2019re contradicting yourself because they, by definition, exist.\n\nOne of the other really popular refutations to it was done by a guy named Gaunilo who lived at the same time as Anselm and was devoutly religious himself. He points out that you can use the same argument to prove that lots of other things exist. His example was a Piland. He says he believes in an island existing, somewhere out there, that is greater than any island you can imagine. An island that than which nothing greater can be conceived. Everything about the island is perfection. We can imagine this glowing perfect island, but if we defined it as an island than which nothing greater can be conceived, then Anselm proves that island DOES exist somewhere out there.\n\nBut then again, there is a refutation to THAT argument that says that there can\u2019t be a perfect amount of trees on the island or a perfect temperature. There is no \u201cperfection\u201d when it comes to those traits, but there can be a perfect \u201cgoodness\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d, and these are the qualities Anselm was proving the existence of with his argument. Honestly, the best way for you to figure out what you think about it is to be alone or with friends and think about it. This is the kind of thing I do all the time, and people sometimes think I\u2019m weird. When I\u2019m in a setting where people are sitting around each other and no one is saying anything, like in the car or at a dinner or something, I look around for the person of the group that obviously thinks they\u2019re very wise and I ask them what they think about some concept in philosophy or politics that is highly debated. See, I know both sides of the argument, and the last thing this type of person is going to do is say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. So it\u2019s fun to listen to their answer and either find the fallacies or offer the counter argument in a respectful way and hear what they say. I\u2019ve learned so much about how people arrive at what they think the truth is just by doing this and I highly recommend it. And come to think of it, now that I\u2019m saying it, it sounds a lot like what Socrates did. Hopefully it won\u2019t get me killed one day.\n\nReal quick, there\u2019s also a reading of Anselm that says that because a quality of a perfect God would be that he exists in all possible realms, if there is even a possibility of him existing, he must exist, but all the same fallacies are present in that argument, they\u2019re just in different places. Just thought i\u2019d mention it so that people didn\u2019t think I\u2019d never heard that reading of it.\n\nNow if this argument doesn\u2019t convince you that God exists, at the very least let it illustrate that the concept of God is not a narrow one-dimensional conversation.\n\nAlmost 4000 years ago if you were born in Babylon, if someone stole something from you, \u201cjustice\u201d to you was cutting their hands off. You\u2019re born in today\u2019s world, someone steals something from you and you have a very different idea of what sort of retribution balances the scales. Just how you can\u2019t be born into modern times, allow modern social conventions to tell you what justice is and then pretend to understand everything about the term justice, you cant do the same thing with God either. It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s not fair to great thinkers of the past, it\u2019s not fair to yourself. You severely limit your understanding of anything if you experience something once and then pretend there\u2019s nothing else to know about it.\n\nWe talked about the period of time before Avicenna where people read Aristotle once and declared it was practically worthless and then people like Al Farabi were able to look at it from a different angle, update the examples and find a way to make it compatible with Islamic theology. Well there\u2019s still two major monotheistic religions left that could have found a way to make Aristotle compatible with them. Judaism and Christianity. Well Christianity is done unquestionably best by next week\u2019s episode: St. Thomas Aquinas. It\u2019s a huge episode. But first I want to talk about what many consider to be the greatest Jewish thinker in history Moses Maimonides.\n\nThe discussion about Moses Maimonides and his philosophy is centered around something we were touching on at the beginning of the show. Should we look at the Bible, or in his case the Torah, the rest of the Old Testament and some other works, should we take those things literally? Should we look at the stories in the Torah and the way that Moses described this monotheistic all-powerful creator and take them to be a perfect account of what God is?\n\nWell, Maimonides thought to do that was ludicrous. The first thing we have to understand is that Maimonides was smart. Really smart. He was a highly skilled doctor AND lawyer. If you\u2019re a girl, he is the best guy you could ever take home to meet your parents. And he applied his massive brain to philosophy.\n\nHave you ever thought about the fact that when the Old Testament talks about God they talk about him as though he has human characteristics? You know, God said let there be light. He\u2019s speaking like he has vocal chords and a larynx? They always refer to God as a He as though he has higher levels of testosterone than other Gods. They call him the Father as though he impregnated something. They even use terms like create that have a very human flair to them, so to the untrained reader, this God sure does seem like something humans made up and they didn\u2019t think about it very hard. Well Moses Maimonides thought this was a terrible mistake. Firstly, even in his times the Torah was written by Moses a LONG time ago. I mean, Maimonides lived during the 1100\u2019s and the Old Testament was written, most people believe around 1400 BC. So, if we use those dates, Maimonides is commenting on a book that was: Maimonides was to the Old Testament as We are to the New Testament. Maimonides said that Moses, when he wrote the first five books of the Old Testament, had a giant task in front of him. See, we have to understand that the people of his time weren\u2019t familiar with the monotheistic personal God outlook. He had enough of a mountain to climb just relaying to people that this single God existed, let alone everything else about it. He had to write it in terms that were understandable to humans in HIS day.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because this is really similar to what we were talking about at the beginning of the show. I mean, what was Moses going to do? Go from zero to calling God an \u201cit\u201d in three seconds? Similar to the way a church wouldn\u2019t tell somebody just getting into things about Plato\u2019s Timaeus, was Moses supposed to tell the people of his time about this perfect, infinite entity that was beyond any linguistic explanation? No! Maimonides says he couldn\u2019t have done that, so that is why he wrote the Bible using personification. God is not a He. He doesn\u2019t have a hand. He doesn\u2019t speak. These are all metaphors for what he actually did that humans can understand easier.\n\nIn fact he goes further than that. I mean, when people that believe in God picture god, they must think of something. Do they think of a homo-sapien? What does he look like? Maimonides doesn\u2019t just say God doesn\u2019t have human qualities. He said that he doesn\u2019t have qualities at all. To have qualities is to have a certain amount of plurality. And that begs an obvious question, one that goes all the way back to Zeno and his famous paradox of Achilles running halfway to the finish line and then half way to the finish line and never actually reaching the finish line because he has to go half way before he can go the whole way. If multiple parts exist in ANY sense, the question, \u201cWhat brought those two parts together.\u201d becomes valid. God cannot actually possess attributes because of this to Maimonides. He says:\n\u201cThere is no oneness at all except in believing that there is one simple essence in which there is no complexity or multiplicity of notions, but one notion only; so that from whatever angle you regard it and from whatever point of view you consider it, you will find that it is one, not divided in any way and by any cause into two notions\u201d\n\nThere are obvious similarities between this conception of god and Plotinus\u2019s transcendent \u201cone\u201d. Remember the first rule of the \u201cone\u201d is that you can\u2019t say anything about the \u201cone\u201d. This is the same thing Laozi and Zhuangzi said about the Dao. It is beyond the unfair categorization of words. See, whenever we say anything, even words like Justice and God, to bring it full circle, we\u2019re categorizing them. That is the object of language, to convey a specific idea. Language wouldn\u2019t work very well if words were like what they are in Hawaii, where one word means twelve different things. But language runs into problems when trying to define or categorize something like God. God is infinite to Maimonides. Maimonides repeatedly says God is indefinable or other similar things. The way around this, what he thinks is that it\u2019s impossible for us to say what God IS, we can only say what God is not. One time I was randomly walking down the road and a mother duck and about seven baby ducklings were walking in a line across the road and a couple people were really impatient, they honked their horns and swerved around them, so I went into the road and tried to hurry the ducks up across the road and I held my hand up to the next car that was waiting like I\u2019m directing traffic or something and when the ducks crossed the person rolled down their window to me and said \u201cYou\u2019re so benevolent!\u201d and I was like \u201cThank You!\u201d at least I think that\u2019s what he said to me.\n\nSo, I\u2019m benevolent for helping the ducks, but is calling God benevolent at that point fair at all? To put God\u2019s benevolence on the same level as mine for helping the ducks is ridiculous to Maimonides. What he draws from this is that anything the Old Testament says about God is a metaphor. To think it\u2019s the truth is naive; you can\u2019t actually categorize God with words. In fact, outside of understanding what it says in the Torah as a metaphorical representation of God, there are only two other ways you can accurately say anything about God. One, is by what is known as negative theology or a concealed negation. You cant talk about what God is, the only thing you can talk about is what God isn\u2019t. If we were saying that God is benevolent, that would be wrong because we use that same word to describe me with the ducks, instead we would say God is not merciless. We can only say what we know he is not. The only other way you can talk about God according to Maimonides is by talking about what God does and then making inferences yourself afterward. You can say that God blessed me with a certain quality, but you can\u2019t say things like God is loyal to his children or loving or anything else you would infer from God blessing you with a certain quality, you would just say \u201cI am blessed.\u201d I\u2019d like to end with a quote by Maimonides that has stuck with me for years he said:\n\u201cWhen I have a difficult subject before me \u2014 when I find the road narrow, and can see no other way of teaching a well established truth except by pleasing one intelligent man and displeasing ten thousand fools \u2014 I prefer to address myself to the one man, and to take no notice whatever of the condemnation of the multitude; I prefer to extricate that intelligent man from his embarrassment and show him the cause of his perplexity, so that he may attain perfection and be at peace.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_2": {"date": "2014-4-25", "text": "Posted on April 25, 2014\nEpisode 3 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Podcast Episode 3 on Socrates and the Sophists.\u00a0\n\nTry to imagine yourself as a citizen of Athens right around the 5th century BC\u2026the city of Athens at this point is undergoing a massive period of prosperity\u2026and there\u2019s this guy named Pericles in charge\u2026he had just assumed the throne and is doing a really good job and this leads to a \u201cgolden age\u201d of culture and philosophy. so naturally when things are going really well in one place\u2026people flock to that place from all the surrounding areas\u2026 and in this case it was mostly from other Greek city-states\u2026now as an Athenian, you would live in a democratic society that had a LOVE of its legal system. Athenians loved a good argument\u2026they loved to be entertained\u2026and most of the time you could find both of those things in the courthouse. Athenians would have been HUGE fans of Judge Judy\u2026or back then it would\u2019ve been \u201cJudge Judicles\u201d\u2026i mean, it was exciting, if someone took you to court for something, it could affect the entire outcome of your life! problem was, language and critical thinking was still in its infancy\u2026so defending yourself in one of these trials was not only crucial, but it was incredibly unlikely that you had the ability to argue or speak well enough to do an effective job of it. on top of all this\u2026 people were just as ambitious back then as we are today, and it was possible to work your way up the social ladder and earn a prestigious place in government, but no one was gonna vote for you if you weren\u2019t educated and well spoken. These two things created enough of a market for self-improvement that an ENTIRE industry of philosopher teachers arose called\u2026the sophists. Now, we talked last episode about the word philosophy\u2026the love of wisdom\u2026but the second half of that word is sophia\u2026which means wisdom. sophists\u2026they have the word for wisdom in their name\u2026they certainly were wise, but as you can see\u2026there was no love involved here. Sophists were a mixture between ITT tech and a taco truck. they were mobile schools. and they\u2019d teach you anything you wanted to learn about for the right price. Music\u2026rhetoric\u2026mathematics\u2026grammar\u2026it actually does remind me of an ITT Tech commercial\u2026there\u2019s always two women in an elevator and they\u2019re like \u201cbob lost his job again\u2026.WHAT BOB LOST HIS JOB? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I dunno! I despise my current job and i just wish i had the skills to move forward! You should call ITT Tech\u2026.they can help you specialize in\u2026paralegal\u2026dental assistant\u2026SCUBA instructor\u2026you know the marquee pops up on the bottom of the screen\u2026ITT tech provides a very similar service to what the early sophists provided and this kind of commercial could be compared to how they used to have competitions screaming at each other trying to draw a crowd and show that they knew more than other sophists. These sorts of screaming matches combined with the just generally sleazy nature of charging A LOT of money for something that was held to be sacred made a lot of people dislike them. Not to mention the actual subject matter they were teaching was pretty shaky. remember how the demand for sophists came about because people were being called to court to defend themselves? well when all those people told these sophists they wanted to win the argument in court and learn to make a case for themselves, the sophists just taught them how to win arguments\u2026they didn\u2019t teach them any facts or true wisdom\u2026as a result you had hundreds of people that just became masters of rhetoric\u2026even in cases where they probably should have been guilty they were able to win\u2026the sophists taught these people little argument tactics like\u2026nitpicking insignificant points\u2026or discrediting the source of the information\u2026They taught them to win the argument, even if they had the worse argument. this didn\u2019t make people too thrilled with the sophists.\n\nThey definitely understood the power of language and its ability to influence people\u2026one very notable sophist was named Gorgias and he wrote about language in one of his works called Encomium of Helen. it was basically a promotional flyer for his school. he wrote it with the sole intention of attracting students and getting business and to really try to make a case for why the investment of their money would yield benefits:\n\n\u201cJust as different drugs draw forth different humors from the body \u2013 some putting a stop to disease, others to life \u2013 so too with words: some cause pain, others joy, some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion\u201d\n\nYou can definitely see in this quote that he not only UNDERSTOOD the power of language, but in a funny way he was using the power of language to try to recruit people to learn the power of language from him.\n\nOne common thread among all the sophists was that they were skeptics. They didn\u2019t like the idea of accepting something because reason tells us it SHOULD be true\u2026they wanted hard evidence. really, they just wanted a philosophy that made sense through the lens of everyday experience. They didn\u2019t like the ideas of Democritus or Empedocles where they said that our senses show us an artificial world and that the real world exists at the atomic level or the level of the mixing of elements. They thought human experience should be paramount\u2026the only question was\u2026if truth is based on a sensory experience, whose sensory experience should be the guide?\n\nOne of the very first and most influential of all the sophists was a guy named Protagoras. he was friends with Empedocles, the guy that walked around in bronze shoes\u2026if that tells you anything. Like the other sophists\u2026Protagoras made his money teaching people not what right or wrong was, but teaching them how to argue. So it really was conveniently aligned with his job security when he decided that he believes that every argument has two sides, neither of which is more right than the other. he said he could win an argument with a worse argument if he was just more persuasive than his opponent. because of this, he concluded it is the man holding the opinion that is the measure of the worth of the argument, not the actual argument itself or the facts its based on. Or as he put it in the opening line of his most famous work \u201cMan is the measure of all things.\u201d\n\nHe took this idea one step further and applied it to everything. what is true for one person may be false for another\u2026what is hot for one person may be cold for another\u2026 but it also applies to morals\u2026what is right for one person may not be right for another etc\u2026he said nothing is inherently good in itself, something is only right because a person or society judges it to be right. This idea of there being no absolutes or moral principles and that everything is subjective\u2026 is known as relativism. Protagoras didn\u2019t think truth was something that only god knew or that you could only attain by thinking and analyzing things for decades. he thought truth is what any one guy makes it\u2026\n\nTo philosophy, Protagoras is the ultra accepting, fanny pack wearing soccer mom that hands out Capri Suns at the end of the games. Now, I\u2019m sure we all know someone or have known someone who agrees with him. It really is a compassionate and accepting way of looking at things and people, so you can\u2019t be too mad at them. but relativism always begs the question\u2026so if everyone is right in whatever truth they arrive at, then what about the people that condemn all other cultures and think everyone else is wrong? shouldn\u2019t they be right too? and i remember reading something Socrates said and it was something like if relativism is true\u2026and everyone is right regardless of what they think\u2026.how can any one man be wiser than another? aren\u2019t they all correct? and also\u2026aren\u2019t they in the business of teaching people stuff for money? why is anyone buying lessons if they already know all the truth? the sophists would\u2019ve said they don\u2019t teach people anything that is better knowledge\u2026just more useful knowledge\u2026knowledge that can be used to benefit the person like in the courts.\n\nAll of this stuff\u2026this relativist view on morals\u2026that there isn\u2019t a good or bad just different\u2026and their specialty to use rhetoric and language to sometimes make the worse argument win all of this no doubt led to the negative outlook on the sophists. People always think about their argument skills and assume they only used them to do nefarious things\u2026they have this view like the sophists sitting around teaching one OJ Simpson after another how to get off scott free. But don\u2019t forget they could have just as easily used their special ability to argue to fight for justice or do what the citizens thought was right. I mean, you can definitely find several examples of how the sophists helped advance philosophy\u2026relativism was a direct assault on the idea of moral principles\u2026or there just being one definition of good, or just, or whatever. and all of this discourse ended up heavily influencing Plato to address the tenants of morality and really try to base it on something eternal or stronger than one man\u2019s opinion, and if it weren\u2019t for the sophists, Plato may have never taken the time to clarify these things, and its some of his most important work. personally, I like what they had to say because it was open-minded. and, if argument was their specialty, any truly great position would have to suffer the gauntlet of sophist argument, and if it could survive that\u2026no matter how annoying it would have been at the time, it would be a stronger more well crafted argument for the experience.\n\nSo real quickly, I\u2019d like to tie up some loose ends and help bring together all of the stuff we\u2019ve covered so far in the last 2 episodes. Now, we arent the first people to ever study presocratic philosophy\u2026there have been several really smart people that have categorized all of these thinkers and ideas in detail\u2026and THEY wanted to find a way to remember it more effectively too. As you can probably imagine, they all didn\u2019t use the same method of categorizing them. If there is one thing you do outside of this podcast this week, you NEED to look at a graph of the presocratic philosophers that is really common. Its really important guys\u2026you have to see the visual\u2026it will really help you put all the philosophers that we\u2019ve covered so far into context. were gonna have it up on the website\u2026but its probably faster for you to just go to GOOGLE images and type in presocratic graph and you\u2019ll see it. On the left it shows the years they lived..on the right are the names of them\u2026color coded to a legend that designates the school of thought they came from, and arrows pointed to all of their students or the people they influenced. Now there are different ways people categorize these presocratics\u2026One example is what we\u2019ve already talked about\u2026the Ionian and Italian classes\u2026those are two geographic regions, so if you wanted to remember them based on where they came from, that would be one method of remembering. But there are other ways\u2026sometimes these historians of the presocratics will break them down by their ideas\u2026and this usually ends with them being separated into 6 or so different schools of thought. Now these will probably never\u2026ever come up in a conversation you\u2019re having about philosophy, but think of it this way, if this ever comes up on jeopardy\u2026people are gonna look at you like you are the rain man\u2026then you just stand up and go\u2026is this TEEN jeopardy? no? too easy and just walk out of the room..you will be an instant legend.. but another reason is, you\u2019ll see why we learned about the particular philosophers we learned about\u2026each one of them comes from a different one of these 6 schools. and I\u2019ve even seen a couple guys break down the 6 schools into 2 separate categories further\u2026they divide them into monists and pluralists. monists are philosophers who thought the universe is made up of one fundamental substance. the three schools that thought this way are the Milesian school, you know that\u2019s where Thales and Anaxamander came from\u2026the Pythagorean school\u2026.the school formed by Pythagoras and his followers\u2026and the eleatic school whose most notable member was Parmenides. It was called the Eleatic school because Parmenides came from a town called Elea in Italy. So those were the monist schools\u2026the pluralist schools were made up of people who believed there wasn\u2019t one fundamental substance\u2026but many fundamental substances that made up the universe. The three schools classified as pluralist would be\u2026you guessed it\u2026the pluralist school\u2026that was the one Empedocles was part of with his earth fire air and water\u2026the atomic pluralist school\u2026which had Democritus and Leucippus at the helm\u2026and then the sophists, who we just talked about. but it is important to note that the sophists weren\u2019t necessarily all pluralists, they just lived at the same time that pluralism was very popular\u2026in fact they didn\u2019t care at all about what the universe was made of\u2026they just wanted to make money. maybe if the universe was made out of coach purses they would\u2019ve cared.\n\nIf you look at the graph\u2026it moves in a pretty deliberate direction towards one guy. Not only was he highly educated from all the conflicting schools of thought that existed at the time, but he took all that he learned from them and created his own completely new way of thinking, a way of thinking that made him one of the biggest names in philosophy. His name, was Socrates.\n\nSocrates must have smelled like the dumpster behind panda express. He had famously terrible hygiene. People would say he went everywhere without shoes, never bathed, never cut his hair, not to mention he wasn\u2019t very easy on the eyes to begin with. there\u2019s a story of him being challenged to a beauty contest as a joke against a guy named Critobulous, where both sides have to make an argument as to why they are more beautiful than the other\u2026they actually went through with everything just to entertain themselves\u2026this is the kind of stuff people did back then\u2026Socrates starts making his case for why he is more beautiful than his opponent Critobulous:\n\n\u201cDo you hold, then, that beauty is to be found only in man, or is it also in other objects?\u201d\n\nCrit. \u201cIn faith, my opinion is that beauty is to be found quite as well in a horse or an ox or in any number of inanimate things. I know, at any rate, that a shield may be beautiful, or a sword, or a spear.\u201d\n\nSoc. \u201cHow can it be that all these things are beautiful when they are entirely dissimilar?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, they are beautiful and fine,\u201d [Note] answered Critobulus, \u201cif they are well made for the respective functions for which we obtain them, or if they are naturally well constituted to serve our needs.\u201d\n\nSoc. \u201cDo you know the reason why we need eyes?\u201d\n\nCrit. \u201cObviously to see with.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, it would appear without further 9ado that my eyes are finer ones than yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, while yours see only straight ahead, mine, by bulging out as they do, see also to the sides.\u201d\n\nCrit. \u201cDo you mean to say that a crab is better equipped visually than any other creature?\u201d\n\nSoc. \u201cAbsolutely; for its eyes are also better set to insure strength.\u201d\n\nI love this story because it encompasses a lot of what Socrates was. he had a great sense of humor, he was famously unkempt and through asking Critobulous to give his definition of what beauty is, he is able to use the contradictions in his definition of beauty to make a case for why he is more beautiful, even though it is obvious to everyone that is isnt. he lost the contest by the way\u2026but it didn\u2019t matter\u2026What he succeeded in doing is that he showed Critobulous that maybe he didn\u2019t know exactly what beauty was. Critobulous said when things are well made for the respective functions for which we obtain them\u2026they are beautiful\u2026but by asking him a series of questions, he proved that the answer couldn\u2019t be that simple.\n\nThis\u2026is\u2026what he is known for. He never started a university, he never lived in a castle, he never even wrote any of his thoughts down, he didn\u2019t believe written text was the way to do philosophy anyway\u2026to Socrates the ONLY thing philosophy was, was discussion, questioning and argument. His particular brand of it was called The Socratic Method.\n\nThe best guess historians can make as to how he developed this intense questioning style is in a famous story about friend of his going to the oracle at Delphi, which was essentially a rotation of an older peasant woman that lived in the area that was on drugs, who apparently channeled the god Apollo\u2026and Socrates\u2019s friend asked the woman who the wisest man in the world was\u2026she said Socrates\u2026his friend came back and said hey Socrates the oracle said you\u2019re the wisest man in the world! Socrates was absolutely shocked by this. he went instantly to work to get to the bottom of it\u2026no victory dance or anything he just started\u2026 he went around to all the wisest people he knew and interrogated them to get to the bottom of it. he realized that these people only thought they knew a lot\u2026when you ask the right questions\u2026it turns out their knowledge is false.\n\nquote from apology:\n\n\u201cI am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.\n\nThis method he used to question people and ultimately point out how little they actually know was his greatest contribution to philosophy\u2026 there\u2019s a quote from a guy named Cicero who was writing about Socrates and said:\n\n\u201cSocrates however (was the) first (who) called philosophy down from heaven, and placed it in cities, and introduced it even in homes, and drove (it) to inquire about life and customs and things good and evil.\u201d\n\nThis quote is amazingly insightful for someone who lived almost a half millennium later\u2026before Socrates, philosophy was done only by men, and only by men who were born into or were clever enough to attain a lot of money, so they didn\u2019t have to spend their days working, they spent them thinking. Once Socrates realized that the reason he was wiser than everyone is because he can admit that he knows nothing, he set out to correct the citizens of Athens and fix their assumptions and preconceptions. He hit the streets\u2026like those Mormons that come to your house on their 10 speed bicycles\u2026in the market place\u2026a public square\u2026in front of the courthouse\u2026and he just started accosting anyone unfortunate enough to not look busy. He\u2019d walk up to them with a very self effacing manner saying things like\u2026oh please help me i am an ignorant person, and I\u2019m wondering if you can help me get to the bottom of something\u2026what is justice? or what is virtue? people would give their, obviously flawed response, and he would just lay into them\u2026questioning them pointing out contradictions or exceptions and eventually getting to a place where the person was either angry at him because he made them feel stupid or angry at him because he wouldn\u2019t leave them alone. either way they were angry. this didn\u2019t make him a lot of friends around town. he even did it to judges or prestigious generals or government officials\u2026it didn\u2019t take long before he had so many people mad at him for doing this that they started labeling him a sophist. but he didn\u2019t care if people liked him or not, his main goal wasn\u2019t to make friends, it was to help others discover how little they knew and get them on the path to truth. he compared himself to a midwife, but instead of helping deliver babies, he questioned everyone and helped deliver new ideas into the world. But his midwifery didn\u2019t stop in his lifetime\u2026the Socratic method can also be called inductive argument\u2026 this is where a set of premises based on experience is first established to be true and then shown to lead to a universal truth. Inductive argument was used by Aristotle and even Francis Bacon who used it as a major influence in the scientific method. That had a little bit of an impact\u2026\n\nSocrates eventually humiliated enough people in public that they banded together and he was put on trial, at the ripe age of 70. The entire story of his trial, his defense, his conviction and his reactions are cataloged by Plato in one of his most famous works, The Apology.\n\nAnd because Socrates didn\u2019t write anything down, all we have to go off of are other people\u2019s perspectives, in the case of Socrates that comes down to four people, Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes and Aristotle. Xenophon was an old friend of Socrates but he doesn\u2019t go into much detail and often put his own theories in the mouth of Socrates as if to give them merit by association, so we cant really trust him. Aristophanes was a play write who made a ridiculous caricature of Socrates as a character in a comedic play, so hes not a good source. and Aristotle wasn\u2019t even born until after Socrates was dead. so that brings us to the last guy\u2026Plato. Plato was his student and deeply respected Socrates, so he probably isn\u2019t the best testimony if we want to know the truth. but he really is all we have, and of the 4 of them, Plato\u2019s testimony is usually held in the highest regard, especially because he was the closest to Socrates. but one thing is for sure, although these 4 sources vary considerably about who Socrates was, its a pretty good chance that the similarities that we find in all 4 of them are accurate right?\n\nTo understand why Socrates was put on trial in the first place and the kind of biased jury he faced, its good to know about the political climate that existed in Greece at the time\u2026\n\nfive years before the trial of Socrates Athens and Sparta ended the Pelopenesian war. Sparta won by the way. So Athens was turned into an oligarchy \u2026taken over by a nice group of gentlemen known as \u201cthe thirty tyrants\u201d in the year 404 BC\u2026they committed such gruesome genocide that they were overthrown only a year later\u2026now, it took a couple years to sort things out, and democracy was finally restored\u2026Socrates was being tried only 2 years after democracy had been restored in Athens\u2026and back then 2 years was nothing\u2026so they were really uneasy and testy towards anyone who was questioning government or trying to evoke change. The charges that they eventually placed against him.. were corrupting the young and denying the gods of the state and introducing new gods. see, there was no separation of church and state\u2026in fact, quite the contrary\u2026 ONLY the state had the power to choose what was a suitable god to worship or not worship, and it didn\u2019t look very good for Socrates being a guy that used to walk around claiming to be getting advice from this thing that followed him around called \u201cDiemonionn\u201d or his personal guardian angel or something like that, people started to ask him about it and he was like\u2026what this guy? Diemonionn?? no\u2026its just flying around giving me advice all the time\u2026its not a god or anything\u2026he was treading on thin ice..take all the personality traits we\u2019ve discussed thus far, and now imagine what you would think of Socrates when an extremely popular play is released with him as a central character. the play was by Aristophanes and it was called \u201cclouds\u201d\u2026 Socrates was depicted as a complete moron, it was a ridiculous cartoonish version of Socrates\u2026but it was supposed to be that way, it was a comedy. the goal was to make people laugh. the Socrates in the play would just ramble on about silly things\u2026like\u2026there is one scene where he puts his arms out and spins around in a circle screaming \u201cI\u2019m walking on air! I\u2019m walking on air!\u201d seeing how many people in modern times get their perception of the world through media or entertainment and then take no time to educate themselves about whether its true or not, its not hard to imagine this immensely popular play shaping the public\u2019s collective view on Socrates. i mean this kind of stuff happens all the time\u2026like how many movies have you seen where a drug deal is going down\u2026or some two-timing street hustlers are taking people to the cleaners\u2026and for some reason its accepted as the gospel truth that if you ask a cop if hes a cop he HAS to tell you yes\u2026It\u2019s IN THE CONSTITUTION MAN!\u2026where? its in there SOMEWHERE man! there\u2019s a lot of words in that constitution\u2026sometimes people just accept what they see in movies\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t seem like it was much different in the time of Socrates. the play also painted him as a sophist and people hated the sophists. The reason it was a common rumor that he was a sophist is because of his lifestyle\u2026although he didn\u2019t take money as payment, the guy didn\u2019t shower, let alone work or know where his next meal was gonna come from\u2026he was broke\u2026so he would trade sitting around having good conversation with people for meals and shelter\u2026this is how he made his living\u2026he just didn\u2019t take money like the sophists did. but people still saw that as taking payment for teaching people\u2026kind of an unfair parallel to draw\u2026the intentions of Socrates\u2019 actions and the intentions of the sophists were COMPLETELY different. all of this \u2026was what the people of the jury had in their heads as \u201cwhat they knew\u201d about Socrates when they first started his trial.\n\nSo, Plato chronicles everything that happened during Socrates trial in his work, the apology, but although it was called the apology\u2026Socrates didn\u2019t apologize for anything. He refused to grovel and beg for his life\u2026it was common at the time to bring up your family and try to appeal to the sympathy of the jurors, but he refused to do that too. see, Socrates was all about doing the RIGHT thing\u2026not about trying to get acquitted. like\u2026in the first part of his trial when he needs to address the charges leveled against him..they were like \u201cto the charge of corrupting the young\u2026what say you?\u201d He says:\n\n\u201d is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized thus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by me, I am very likely to be harmed by him; and yet I corrupt him, and intentionally, too\u201d\n\nBasically what he\u2019s saying is\u2026to corrupt someone is to harm them\u2026it makes no sense to say that id harm someone\u2026because he\u2019s younger and stronger than i am\u2026I\u2019m 70 years old\u2026and he could beat me up me\u2026so why would I ever do this? that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026.\n\nIt went down in history as one of the worst arguments ever crafted.\n\nbut its not because he was incapable of defending himself, he just wasn\u2019t making decisions for the sake of staying alive or avoiding punishment. He was just trying to do what he saw as \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d which wasn\u2019t begging the jury for mercy and manipulating people. and his main focus wasn\u2019t on defending the ACTUAL charges\u2026he spent most of his time defending the terrible reputation that followed him into the trial. and really that boiled down to him defending the way he carried himself, like not bathing and not caring about the typical things Athenians cared about like money or status. he had to explain why he questioned people about their beliefs and embarrassed them\u2026and in the process of explaining all this he didn\u2019t just defend the way he lived his life\u2026he didn\u2019t just claim he shouldn\u2019t be punished for what he does\u2026he actually went so far as to tell the Athenians they should be thanking him for all this questioning he has bestowed upon them.\n\nSo in Athenian trials there are a few different votes that the jury does in any given trial\u2026the first one is to determine if you\u2019re guilty or not guilty\u2026he obviously failed miserably there\u2026the second vote was \u2026the person accused offers what they think a suitable punishment would be\u2026you\u2019d think he would start changing the unapologetic tune\u2026but instead he decides the best course of action is to insult them a bit more\u2026\n\nHe went on to say other things in the trial like:\n\n\u201cAre you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest\u00a0amount of money and honor and reputation,\u00a0and caring so little about wisdom and\u00a0truth and the greatest improvement of the soul? \u201d\n\nwhen he was asked what the proper punishment would be\u2026.he says that he\u2019s been doing the Athenians a favor with all of this questioning hes been throwing at them\u2026so he suggests his \u201cpunishment\u201d for this \u201ccrime\u201d should be free meals for life at the expense of the state. usually this kind of thing was done for people who were victorious at the Olympic games from Athens\u2026after he said this\u2026 during the second vote, people voted for the death penalty by a larger margin than they voted him guilty in the first place\u2026he actually turned people from thinking he\u2019s not guilty to wanting him dead. he didn\u2019t care though\u2026he saw death as just another one of these things people think they are wise about\u2026but really nobody knows whether death is a bad thing or whether it is the best thing that could ever happen to you. and when he said maybe its the best thing that can ever happen to you, he wasn\u2019t talking about going to an amusement park in the sky he was talking about a release from all the things that trouble humans on a daily basis. Quote from apology:\n\n\u201cTo fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils. And surely it is the most blameworthy ignorance to believe that one knows what one does not know.\n\nLike I said before, Socrates wasn\u2019t saying what he was saying to try to get the charges dropped\u2026he was saying what he was saying with the same motives he had for doing everything else in his life\u2026to live a \u201cgood\u201d and virtuous life. He was one of the first philosophers to ask\u2026what is a \u201cgood\u201d life? and in his opinion, a good life was getting\u2026 a sort of \u201cpeace of mind\u201d\u2026 as a result of doing the right thing, as opposed to doing things simply because society tells you its a good idea. He didn\u2019t agree with Protagoras and most of the sophists who believed morals were relative\u2026he believed morals were absolutes and they apply to everyone in the world the same way, regardless of what country or time period they are from. i think this is very insightful\u2026the morals and laws of then are not the same as now\u2026.but which of them is more right? Socrates would have argued that neither of them are right and that we are in no place to even be labeling what is good or bad, because we don\u2019t even know what \u201cgood\u201d or bad is\u2026how can you philosophize about what is good, if you don\u2019t even know what the word good truly means\u2026he thought that life\u2026 when you\u2019re on earth is not just some preparation for what happens after death, he thought there was a whole set of tasks and problems to tackle when you\u2019re on the planet\u2026like thought, self reflection and striving to live a virtuous life\u2026but the catch was, Socrates thought the only way to live a virtuous life is to know what the TRUE definitions of these virtues were\u2026and the only way to find that was through extensive thought\u2026he believed that the key to living a good life was understanding these virtues\u2026virtue was the best and most important trait to have. he thought that when people don\u2019t act virtuously, and commit evil acts, that no one actually desires to do evil\u2026if only they knew enough they would never commit acts of evil because that knowledge would then make them uncomfortable and humans all strive by their nature to be as comfortable as possible so they would never do it. now, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize several counter examples to this\u2026like people addicted to cigarettes want to stop\u2026but they cant\u2026or various other examples where we KNOW what the correct decision is, but choose to act otherwise out of convenience. but at the time, people must have not argued with Socrates that much about it and just thought they had not reached the level of wisdom he was at\u2026he appeared to be walking proof of this life\u2026he was definitely seen as wise, and he seemed to never make an immoral decision. in retrospect his self-mastery was probably just the byproduct of countless hours of self-reflection. through these countless hours of thinking about things you arrive at knowledge. he famously said there is only one good: knowledge and one evil\u201d ignorance. knowledge is DEEPLY tied to morality\u2026like we just said\u2026if people KNEW enough they would never make a wrong decision, or commit an evil act. one really notable thing that makes him stand out from other philosophers around the time is that he thought that EVERYONE could be a philosopher\u2026not just could be\u2026but should be or must be\u2026his most famous saying was when he was defending himself at his trial saying that \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth l"}, "episode_3": {"date": "2014-4-25", "text": "Posted on April 25, 2014\nEpisode 2 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 2 on Italian Pre-Socratic Philosophy.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, when you hear the name Pythagoras you probably think of, the Pythagorean theorem. You probably have post traumatic stress flashbacks to 7th grade pre-algebra class and all the turmoil he caused you there. you know, A squared plus B squared equals C squared. but it turns out, as ill explain in a second, you may have been mad at the wrong guy all along. like all of these early philosophers, not much is known for sure, most of the information we have is hearsay from other future philosophers, most of the time those future philosophers are just 2 guys, Plato and Aristotle. but in the case of Pythagoras, this lack of hard facts and general ambiguity is at an extreme. to history, Pythagoras is known almost as a mythical figure, i mean we know he existed\u2026we know for sure he believed in reincarnation and that he had a thing for numbers, but as far as everything else, saying that Pythagoras the man himself did it, is speculation. see, most of the stuff we know about him was written down by his followers. followers that were vowed to secrecy and saw him as an exalted figure, like a messiah. and all that secrecy fueled a TON of speculation from people that weren\u2019t his followers, which no doubt contributed this mythical figure status that he had.\n\nBut why would his followers see him as a messiah? cause he named himself a messiah. and this is how I remember Pythagoras, I think of him as the \u201ccrazed cult leader\u201d from ancient Greek philosophy. cult leader is probably a little unfair, but only because of the modern connotation associated with the term cult leader. He definitely was at the helm of a religious cult back then. His love of mathematics and astronomy probably began when he was young when he visited Egypt and Miletus, and its not farfetched to think that he would\u2019ve studied under the Milesian school of thought, remember that\u2019s where Thales and Anaxamander came from that we talked about last episode. i mean, he grew up right next to them, he certainly would have heard about them and was born into the kind of social standing that would\u2019ve allowed him the luxury to travel and study. but around the age of 40, he started gathering together these followers who saw him as a religious sage, and set up a commune in a town called Croton, in southern Italy. a few different sources say when he first started up he had around 300 members of this commune and everything he\u2019s known for comes from the work he did when he was inside of this commune, and because of how unclear it is whether he himself came up with any ONE theory or whether it was one of his followers attributing it to his master\u2026the brains behind the operation, historians just kind of lump everything under this one umbrella of Pythagoreanism. And this applies to everything, even the famous Pythagorean theorem itself. Its not hard to imagine a modern day example of this exact situation happening, i mean imagine if tomorrow someone like, Barrack Obama started up a scientific movement called\u2026Obamareanism. and he has a lot of people on this quest with him, so long after he lives a long healthy life and dies at the age of 124, Obamareanism is still going\u202650 years after his death some guy that still calls himself an Obamarean comes up with a pretty important scientific theorem. 2500 years later when students are learning about it in science class might call it the Obamarean theorem, and they also might mistakenly think Obama himself came up with it.\n\nNow, Pythagoras himself wouldn\u2019t have been offended, he wasn\u2019t doing all of this stuff to become famous, or to leave some legacy. he was doing it simply for the love of wisdom. which reminds me, the world philosopher\u2026means lover of wisdom. \u2018philo\u2019 means love, \u2018soph\u2019 means wisdom, and Pythagoras himself was actually the first guy to coin the term. he came up with the word, philosopher. now, all of his followers may have called themselves Pythagoreans, but they definitely were philosophers. imagine being one of these cult members\u2026imagine Pythagoras convincing you that its a great idea for you to join this commune he is starting up in Southern Italy. It really speaks to how likeable and authoritative Pythagoras must have been. You know how there\u2019s IQ which is your intelligence quotient and then there\u2019s NQ which is your networking quotient, or your ability to interact socially and influence people? Pythagoras was no doubt a genius in both of these areas. I mean, this commune wasn\u2019t like, hey come live in a village with us and study math every once in a while. This was a complete lifestyle overhaul. and a restrictive overhaul at that. Not only was it dedicating your entire life to the pursuit of knowledge in math, music and astronomy, the 3 areas they saw as the most important those were only half of it. The other half was the religious side of the cult and all the behavioral restrictions. so you may be asking, how can Pythagoras go from a young person that is just generally fascinated with the way the Egyptians did math to thinking he\u2019s a messiah for some movement? i think the best way to understand is to put yourself in the shoes of someone studying math at the time.\nYou know when you\u2019re in math or science class and you sign your name at the front of the textbook and you can look back at the people that had the book before you for generations, you can actually see this is the same book Abe Lincoln used when he was a kid\u2026they didn\u2019t have that thick textbook, let alone one that had been around for hundreds of years. Math was done completely differently. When these people thought about the number four, it wasn\u2019t the number 4\u2026it was the essence behind the number four\u2026like the number four is just a representation of a quantity of four things. when these people drew a right triangle on the ground and were thinking about the squares of the different sides of it, they actually drew a square with the side of the triangle being one side of the square and counted the units. math to them consisted of little things, little experiments they could repeat and understand what the world was in a world that was no where near understood. we take so many things for granted today that are explained in modern physics and chemistry that they had no idea about, so to realize that adding together the squares of two sides of a right triangle was equal to the square of the hypotenuse\u2026that was cool. But to realize\u2026that applies to all right triangles and there are no exceptions to that rule\u2026and to feel that you really understand something about the essence of that triangle and the laws that govern the sides of that triangle or any triangle in the universe? That must have been\u2026mind numbing. I mean here\u2019s this giant universe with tons of mystery we know nothing about\u2026and here\u2019s a formula we arrived at to explain one part of it. They saw these mathematical proofs as the way the universe could be understood, or as they put it, number is the ruler of all forms. So in that sense, they kind of jumped to a conclusion, but its easy to see how back then, these proofs must have seemed like magic, or god given wisdom\u2026not only that, but its also to see how a man like Pythagoras, the messenger boy arriving at these conclusions could have seemed like a demigod himself. The difference between Pythagoras and what we think of as a modern cult leader is that the modern cult leaders start these things up so they can have money, power or influence, its not crazy to think that Pythagoras actually thought of himself as relaying some sacred information. whenever i think of this concept I love to contrast it with the fact that the SAME information that was so powerful it made a man believe he was a messiah in a religious movement 2500 years ago, is the midterm for 7th grade pre-algebra in today\u2019s world. It really is a testament to human progress and just how far we\u2019ve come as a species. and how about a testament to how far were capable of going.\n\nIt must have been easy to jump to a conclusion like they did given the fact that there were other conclusions they arrived at in other areas of study that completely reinforced this concept of numbers being the rulers of all forms. They saw math, music and astronomy as three areas of study that were completely interrelated and understanding them was the key to understanding the universe. Pythagoras is said to have stumbled across \u2026much of the basis for his understanding of ratios and proportions as they relate to numbers\u2026 when he was actually studying the relationship between musical intervals and harmonies.\n\nIt kind of makes sense too, because understanding the difference between two music notes is similar to understanding the difference between two numbers. in every single source about Pythagoras I\u2019ve read there\u2019s this story about him getting a revelation about musical notes while listening to blacksmiths work so there must be some merit to the story\u2026it basically says that by complete chance, Pythagoras just decided to listen to two blacksmiths working\u2026i guess there wasn\u2019t HBO back then\u2026he had to entertain himself some way, and the two blacksmiths were hammering on their anvils and one had an anvil exactly twice the size of the other anvil, so when their hammers beat on the anvil, it made the same note\u2026just one octave apart. an octave in the world of music is the same notes, just 8 intervals up or down. so its the same note\u2026for example\u2026and I\u2019m sorry for this \u201cLA! LA!\u201d remind me to never sing in a podcast again\u2026\n\nit wasn\u2019t just the 8 note difference between octaves of each other, Pythagoras found that harmonies that we hear all the time, even in music today were just simple mathematical ratios\u2026like in the case of a major scale, a major third would be 3 intervals up or a fifth, five intervals up. numbers governing acoustic relationships, just reinforced the idea that numbers could explain everything in the universe. In 1865, John Newlands used these relationships that Pythagoras found and used it as the basis for his discovery that chemical elements are arranged according to atomic weight, and that those with similar properties occur at every eighth element\u2026like notes of a musical scale. this became known as the law of octaves and it lead to the development of the periodic table of elements was organized.\nagain, you can see how finding constants when explaining things with numbers could reinforce the idea that everything can be understood through numbers\n\nWe can\u2019t really blame them, though. It\u2019s scary to live in a world without explanation..and in a world without explanation, its easy to try to apply meaning to things that really might not have that much significance. But as long as we understand what could have led them to think this way, I think its really interesting to hear what the Pythagoreans thought the best way to live life was. If you lived in this Pythagorean cult, you couldn\u2019t eat meat. you were a vegetarian. the reasoning behind this was because Pythagoreans believed in reincarnation, more specifically the transmigration of souls to different species. they thought that by eating other animals, you were essentially eating your grandma who just died and was reincarnated into the body of a chicken. what is this based on? well the story goes that one day some men Pythagoras was hanging around were beating a dog and it cried out in pain\u2026 and he told them to stop because he swore he heard the voice of his friend crying out in the dogs yelp. that dog had to be his friend\u2026reincarnated\u2026now I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true , but how about we take out the reincarnation part and just arrive at the revelation to\u2026not beat dogs? what kind of sick people was he hanging around anyway.\nwhen it came to reincarnation, the Pythagoreans believed that this cycle of constantly dying and being reincarnated into a new body was some sort of punishment, and that the goal of life was to end the cycle of reincarnation and finally be set free to live eternally in the blessed realm\u2026either the sun or the moon\u2026i guess you take your pick. for the record I pick the moon.\nonly by adhering to a strict regimen of behavioral restrictions and thought can you end the cycle of reincarnation. but where did they get this idea? historians say they may have gotten this idea from an OLD mystic ancient Greek religion called Orphism. There\u2019s a story that basically conveys the same idea\u2026the story of Dionysus. basically Zeus had sex with his mom and they had a beautiful baby girl\u2026who Zeus then had sex with, once she was of legal age of course, and then they had a kid named Dionysus\u2026.you know what? long story short\u2026man is part evil because of some bad stuff the gods did. one night. but the concept that man is part evil and the only way to cure himself of this evil that he is born with is to live a life of restriction and thought was an Orphic concept, and for Pythagoras the thought portion of this was math music and astronomy. so why did he pick those concepts as opposed to something else? because the understanding of those topics led to the understanding of the universal truths that govern the universe. eternal truths\u2026truths that never change. And its pretty awesome to think about it the way they did\u2026they thought that the closest thing a person can achieve to immortality is to understand these eternal truths and to try to live in harmony with them. by understanding concepts that are eternal, that\u2019s the closest man will ever get to being immortal.\n\nA couple other interesting facts about Pythagoreans,\nA lot of people claim Pythagoreans established the idea of deductive reasoning\u2026but if you look at the sources where these people get their information\u2026there isn\u2019t anything particularly conclusive. You can kind of say they had a rudimentary version of it, but the first use of axioms is obvious in the work of Euclid 500 years later and there is a lot of deductive reasoning done by Parmenides, but not by Pythagoras. Pythagoras and his followers really innovated the idea of studying mathematics solely for the sake of intellectual satisfaction. rather than trying to construct buildings better or some other practical gain.\nOne other very notable contribution is he was the first one to make the statement that arriving to conclusions through reason was greatly superior to evidence gathered through the senses. There have been hundreds of rationalist philosophers that would go on to arrive at notable conclusions themselves, but one of the best examples of this was Plato and the idea of using reason to arrive at conclusions was the BASIS of his super famous theory of forms. Pythagorean thought went on to develop in small pockets over the years even though the commune was no longer around. The thoughts developed eventually went on to greatly influence Nicolaus Copernicus and Johaness Keppler\u2019s treatise on the harmony of the universe among others.\n\nI think of Parmenides as the dark, dark cloud of deductive reasoning. To the presocratic philosophers, Parmenides represented this dark cloud on the horizon, because all these ideas great thinkers before him were so sure of, he threatened to destroy everything they thought they knew with his ideas. Parmenides was a huge curve ball in philosophy. a turning point in early philosophy, people like Thales and Anaxamander they tried to explain how the cosmos came to existence, parmenides explained how it couldn\u2019t have come into existence in the first place. everyone before him tried to explain the phenomena we saw in the changing world\u2026he seemed to be able to prove that nothing ever changed, that those phenomena didn\u2019t exist and that true reality was that everything was one single unchanging blob.\n\nNobody saw this coming\u2026he came completely out of left field with this. One day, he just told everyone a story about taking a chariot ride in the clouds and coming across a goddess who for some reason decides to let him in on the secret that\u2026oh yeah everything that every man has thought before you is completely wrong and let me just give you the real answers. I mean who was this guy, Parmenides, just completely out of the blue he comes up with a single poem that calls into question everything that everyone had every thought they\u2019d known previously? It must have seemed somewhat believable that it was given to him by some goddess, because its not like he was building on the ideas of any previous thinker. This was the first time anyone had ever brought deductive reasoning to the table in any real sense. And it\u2026was\u2026huge. Imagine being the first person to discover some other really effective way of doing something that changed the way the whole world thought about things. Like\u2026.imagine if you were the first guy in history to tie your shoes with the two bunny ears method. Old people would be looking at your perfectly tied shoes\u2026resenting you. You\u2019d cast doubt into the hearts of all the loop swoop and pullers that lived alongside you. You\u2019d shake things up in the shoe tying community, that\u2019s for certain, and Parmenides did exactly that with his deductive reasoning.\n\nThe only surviving poem, and thus all we know about Parmenides is actually really difficult to read because he was one of only two presocratic philosophers that wrote all of his thoughts down in something called hexameter verse. It\u2019s a structured poetic style of writing that was pretty common at the time\u2026famous poets like Homer and Hesiod wrote in. Philosophers knew that talking about the nature of the cosmos and existence wasn\u2019t the most entertaining concept to the average person. It was by no means a Broadway musical. So to try to make it more digestible to people, he tried to write it in an entertaining poetic way so people would not only be able to enjoy the poem, but also be exposed to his heady concepts. It\u2019s actually a brilliant idea\u2026Parmenides in this way reminds me of C.S. Lewis how he wrote this masterpiece of literature\u2026the chronicles of Narnia that people deeply enjoy, and it turns out it was an allegory of Christianity the whole time\u2026like Jesus is the lion and what not.\n\nAnyway, onto his deductive reasoning and how it changed philosophy. His idea was actually pretty simple, but he phrases it in a way that makes it a little difficult to follow. He says\u2026what is is\u2026.and what is not is not\u2026in other words if something exists it exists if something does not exist it does not exist and its impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time right? he says that because of this, a point in time where the universe was in a state of nothing existing is impossible because things exist now and nothing can come into existence from a place where nothing exists. In other words, something cannot come from nothing and so the universe must have always existed in some form and is eternal. If the universe came into existence\u2026 what caused it to come into existence in the first place? what made it start then as opposed to earlier or later?\nPhilosophers hadn\u2019t really thought of this before, they were content with accepting that\u2026they were here and it did exist and everything has a beginning, so lets try to think of some interesting explanations for how it happened that don\u2019t involve gods.\n\nHe also thought that we cannot speak of what \u201cis not\u201d or what doesn\u2019t exist. For example, to think about a unicorn is to essentially think about nothing\u2026because it doesn\u2019t exist. To talk about a unicorn, to Parmenides is just to be making meaningless sound, because it doesn\u2019t exist. The way Parmenides sees it, if change was possible it would first have to be one way and then change into another way that its not right now, but we can\u2019t speak of what is not, so we cant speak of change. Therefore change is impossible. He uses this same logic to say that nothing actually moves either cause it would have to be in one place first\u2026etc. Parmenides thought the universe was one, eternal, unchanging massive blob with no empty space inside that is like a sphere. And at the time Greeks saw the sphere as the most perfect and divine of all the geometric forms.\nIf any part of you is annoyed with Parmenides for coming to all these confusing conclusions, take some solace in the fact that he lived his entire life walking around in a world that he logically concluded to be a complete illusion, a world where change and movement is impossible so doing anything, as far as he saw it was absolutely pointless.\n\nThe picture Parmenides begins to paint begins to look familiar right? There seems to be a common thread among most of the presocratics where they use this amazing ability to think they\u2019ve been given to arrive at a fundamental conclusion about all the stuff around them\u2026and then they spend the rest of their time trying REALLY REALLY hard to apply that one concept to as many things as possible sometimes even the entire universe. With Democritus and Leucippus it was their atoms like we talked about last episode, with the Pythagoreans it was numbers and harmony, but in the case of Parmenides its pretty extreme. he basically is saying that although we see motion and change and birth and death\u2026that none of it is actually happening. which completely contradicts what we see. not to mention, hes saying we cant speak of \u201cwhat is not\u201d\u2026but by talking about the fact that birth, death motion or change, he IS speaking of \u201cwhat is not\u201d. and that just doesn\u2019t make any sense Parmenides.\nhe would\u2019ve said, yeah, you think you\u2019re speaking of something that doesn\u2019t exist but really you\u2019re just talking about nothing, you should abandon these \u201ccommon sense prejudices\u201d you have. see, the fact you think you\u2019re talking about something that doesn\u2019t exist is based on evidence you\u2019ve gathered through the sense organs, if what you think you see with your senses and what reason tells you contradicts each other\u2026reason should always be held in higher regard because the senses are deceptive and cant be trusted.\nHe definitely was a weird guy. but he certainly wasn\u2019t a dumb guy. This idea that he is talking about is, in my opinion his greatest contribution to philosophy. It was the fact that all the thinkers that came before him and their perceptions of the world were actually full of contradictions. We use our senses and think we see changes happening all around us, but reason, at least as far as he saw it, tells us change is impossible. Not only was this a strong victory for proponents of using reason to arrive at conclusions as opposed to the senses, but it gave credence to the idea of accepting the outcome of an experiment despite what might immediately appear to be rational or irrational through the senses. In other words, you have to trust the science.\n\nThis idea that parmenides had about the ordinary world that we see just no existing\u2026that contrast with common sense was too difficult for anyone to swallow. future philosophers wanted to agree with him, but they just couldn\u2019t accept that everything they see isn\u2019t real. so they took his idea that there is a world where there is an ultimate reality where things aren\u2019t born and doesn\u2019t change or die, and added onto it an explanation for the seemingly changing world that we perceive. Like Atomism.\nEmpedocles was one of these philosophers that added into parmenides. he thought that the whole world was made up of 4 elements that were in themselves eternal and unchanging, but added that they had the ability to combine with each other to make up the changing world we see.\n\nAccording to Empedocles, he was an immortal god among men who had been given his divine status because of all the knowledge he had gained through extensive thought during his life. He would walk around everywhere in this ridiculous outfit, a purple robe, a giant golden belt, bronze shoes, and a wreath around his head like he was the Delphic oracle. And he did it on purpose\u2026he said when he walks through a new town, he wants people to see him and wonder what hes all about and follow him around in the thousands\u2026and it WORKED.\n\nAnyone that didn\u2019t agree with him or questioned him were complete fools.\nYou see, he was a god and he knew of a time a long time ago when man experienced a golden age when all men lived happily together and there was no turmoil in the world. The bad news was all men at first were gods, they just lost their immortal status and were put here on earth. the good news was they all had the ability to become gods again, they just had to live the right way. Only through knowledge and following Empedocles could men can regain the divine status they once had.\n\nLike I said before, he agreed with parmenides that the universe is eternal and that nothing is ever created or destroyed. He just tried to find a compromise that would account for the seemingly changing world that we see everyday with our sense organs.\nHe claimed there were four elements. Air, Water, Fire and Earth and that all things are just different recipes of different quantities of these four elements. Combine his ridiculous super-hero like getup, with his Earth, Fire, Wind and Water with his views on the forces of love and strife that I\u2019ll talk about later and he begins to sound pretty familiar.\ncaptain planet theme song\nEmpedocles is Captain Planet. At least that\u2019s how I remember him. For anyone that is incredibly confused right now, let me explain. Captain Planet was a cartoon from the early nineties. where a group of teenagers all had the power to summon a superhero named captain planet. each one of them had a ring. there were 5 different things they called out and then a double rainbow of light shot out of their rings and captain planet arrived. these were earth, fire, wind, water and heart.\nIf Captain Planet has any emotional context for you, it is an extremely effective way to remember Empedocles. Like I said, the crazy super-hero like getup, his views of earth fire air and water and heart symbolizing his thoughts on the forces of love and strife that we will talk about in a little. If Captain planet holds no significance to you, i humbly apologize for wasting 30 seconds of your life, and maybe consider checking out a few episodes for comedic value, you just don\u2019t see cartoons that deliver a positive message like that to kids anymore.\n\nEmpedocles thought the elements, earth fire air and water, themselves do not change, they just intermingle and move around and combine with each other. This was the compromise Empedocles made to Parmenides\u2019 extreme idea that change and movement is impossible. Empedocles said that the process of the elements intermingling and moving around is what man calls \u201cbirth\u201d or death. birth and death are just human constructs, or words, used to define different assemblies of unchanging things. this has a lot of similarities with the idea of atomism that we were talking about last episode. remember, the atoms themselves do not change, just the configuration of atoms.\nhe saw the mixing of the different elements as similar to the mixing of colors of paint that an artist would have, when you look at a cup, you\u2019re really just looking at nature\u2019s masterful combination of these 4 elements. and this applied to anything you can see around you. what about metals? he had bronze shoes after all. all metals were actually seen as water because they could be melted down and combined with other metals.\n\n\u201cAs painters, men well taught by wisdom in the practice of their art, decorate temple offerings they take in their hands pigments of various colors, and after fitting them in close combination, more of some and less of others, they produce from them shapes resembling all things, creating trees and men and women, animals and birds and water-nourished fish, and long-lived gods too, highest in honour; so let not error convince you in your mind that there is any other source for the countless perishables that are seen, but know this clearly, since the discourse you have heard is from a god.\u201d\n\ni like how, just for good measure he adds on at the end\u2026by the way I\u2019m a god so trust me. Just in case you guys didn\u2019t agree with the mixing of paint analogy I just made\u2026as you\u2019ve probably noticed he was pretty similar to Pythagoras in several ways. He WAS a Pythagorean. He believed in reincarnation. He believed that there were two forces in the universe that were constantly at battle with one another. One of them was love, which not only is responsible for bringing the elements together to make up the everyday items we see, but is responsible for human emotion, this force of love is actually what caused humans to feel sexual attraction towards each other\u2026the other force was strife, which constantly seeks to drive the elements apart and break them down and in the case of humans its what drives people away from each other and creates problems. love and strife are constantly at battle with one another and the result of this constant battle is the changing world we perceive.\n\nsee, he thought a long time ago, there was a time when love reigned supreme\u2026it had triumphed over strife completely and all the elements were all in one sphere with love protecting them, in the middle of the universe\u2026but then strife started attacking love and the elements got out of this protective sphere and were scatted around everywhere\u2026and then love fought back and started grouping the elements back together, in the process, as these small quantities of elements are drawn together by love, the everyday things we see like mountains, and trees and chairs were assembled. In the current state of the world, love and strife are constantly battling one another..love combines the elements into a human or a dog and then strife tears it apart and makes it into ashes\u2026 eventually, a long time from now Empedocles says that one of them, either love or strife, will reign supreme and the entire process will start over again.\n\nwell, its a wonderful story and all, but the thing that makes it important to philosophy is that it was the first time anyone had thought of the idea of there being an intangible force responsible for the actions of the elements. before, if the whole world was made up of varying different forms of water, water itself doesn\u2019t move right? how can you explain the fact it somehow manifested itself into all this stuff? the idea of a force being behind it was revolutionary and incredibly insightful and similar to what we know of forces in modern physics.\nHe also seems to have accurately arrived at the idea of natural selection as being the way animals survived and adapted. they owe the features that allow them to survive to the fact that there used to be MANY different species of creatures and the ones with characteristics that didn\u2019t behoove them died off before they were able to propagate\u2026leaving only the strongest and best adapted. quote\u201d here sprang up many faces without necks\n\nOne last way you can think of Empedocles as Captain Planet is that he was a huge proponent of recycling, but not recycling cans and bottles\u2026but ideas. He really was a giant conglomeration of several great ideas that were successful for previous philosophers in their own time. He was like Pythagoras being the crazy demigod, and he also had a whole religious message to his philosophy that was similar to Pythagoras\u2026basically it was a positive message about living with the ways of love as opposed to strife and that all men are being punished in their current form because they sacrificed animals and ate meat. His constant battling spectrum is like the flux theory of Heraclitus. His compromise on Parmenides eternal universe being very similar to Democritus\u2019 theory on atoms, although he was a contemporary of Democritus.\nAnyway, legend has it that eventually Empedocles jumped into a volcano to prove that he was immortal, i don\u2019t have to tell you how that one worked out for him. but he left the world an accomplished man who came up with a theory of what everything around us is made of that was so successful that Aristotle himself heavily endorsed it with only a few corrections and it was widely seen as the truth until 18th century.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_4": {"date": "2014-4-25", "text": "Posted on April 25, 2014\nEpisode 4 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Podcast\u00a0Episode 4 on Plato.\u00a0\n\nThis episode was really close to being a two-part episode. When you\u2019re dealing with philosophers that are as influential as Plato and have a body of work as extensive as Plato\u2019s, it starts to become very difficult to make one single 45 minute conglomeration of it all. A guy named Alfred North Whitehead famously said that all of western philosophy \u201cconsists of a set of footnotes to Plato\u201d and his work. Footnotes! I mean, by the end of this episode \u2026 you\u2019re gonna understand why he said that. and you\u2019ll understand why it was almost a two-parter. Plato wrote 27 treatises\u2026practically 27 full length books\u2026and the reason I decided to keep it down to one part is because I saw the content that was going to be in the second episode and I asked myself what I would want in a philosophy podcast. I don\u2019t think anyone here is listening to this podcast so they can be the\u2026curator of the Plato museum or something, I don\u2019t think anyone wants to know what the guy\u2019s favorite color was\u2026you want to know the essentials. What were his most notable contributions to philosophy\u2026notable being ones that ended up influencing future philosophers and shaping the world we live in. And now that were dealing with philosophers that have most of if not all of their work surviving to this day, we can\u2019t cover everything. Plato wrote a treatise about the nature of the physical world and human beings and the origins of the universe called the Timaeus. Its brilliant. Its fascinating, but not necessarily game changing in the philosophical world. So what I\u2019m gonna do, out of respect to the people that don\u2019t care to hear about the non-essentials of these philosophers, starting this week with the Timaeus and any other non-essential work of future philosophers, I\u2019m gonna write up a synopsis of it and send it out as additional content with the weekly email I send out to let people know a new episode came out. Uh, anyone whose interested enough in philosophy to want to expand their understanding of it even further to that level\u2026uh my hats off to you. you are awesome. let me be the guy that digs through dozens of sources to bring you an unbiased account of it. you can sign up to get an email when a new episode comes out on Philosophizethis.org, onto Plato.\n\nPlato experienced heartbreak in 399 BC. He watched from the sidelines in horror as his teacher, friend and mentor Socrates was put on trial and convicted to death\u2026 and there was nothing he could do about it. He was angry with the city of Athens, and rightfully so\u2026their witch hunt mentality following the Pelopenesian war killed his best friend \u2026 and he decided he needed a little change of scenery. A 12 year change of scenery. It was like the movie Wild Hogs..He left town crestfallen\u2026went on an extended road trip where he learned a lot about the world, and a little about himself along the way. It was a transformative road trip. It changed the entire way he looked at the world for the rest of his life. You could almost think of this road trip as an extension and finishing of his education\u2026he studied under Socrates for a long time, learning the Socratic method and argument, and then he studied abroad. He studied with Euclides, Theodorus, the Pythagorean\u2026some say he made it all the way to Egypt. Now what happened next is still open for debate. Some sources say he was captured towards the end of his road trip and sold into slavery, uh then his friends rescued him and brought him back to Athens, some say something else triggered the end of the journey, but what is certain is that SOMETHING made him decide in 387 BC to return to Athens and found his infamous school called \u201cthe academy\u201d a school that would stay operational for almost 900 years in one form or another, a school whose name is where we get our modern word academic. He took it upon himself with this new school of his to not only catalog the thoughts of his beloved teacher Socrates but to also foster and develop future philosophers. But Plato wasn\u2019t satisfied with the definition of the word philosopher. Pythagoras\u2019s view that its a lover of wisdom wasn\u2019t good enough for him, he felt more was necessary to be a good candidate to go to his school.\n\nPlato didn\u2019t like how the definition of philosopher included people that just always loved to hear a new fact. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all known someone like who hes talking about\u2026some guy\u2026buys a diet peach Snapple, looks under the cap and sees, did you know your body is made up of 80% water? and then runs around telling everyone about it endlessly. Now, I have no problem with this guy\u2026and neither does Plato, aside from the annoying evangelizing of a random fact\u2026but Plato didn\u2019t think this guy should be considered a philosopher. Plato would see him as a sightseer, someone who enjoys wisdom for practical benefits or for the spectacle of it all, not for the wisdom itself. Plato thought Non philosophers live in a sort of dreamlike state, they see things they think are beautiful and naively think that the objects themselves encompass what beauty is\u2026really, if they looked deeper what they would see is\u2026beauty itself. He didn\u2019t think to be a philosopher you should be pursuing wisdom because you love to revel in the fact of the day\u2026a true philosopher is someone who uses their brain as merely a tool in the process of arriving at wisdom.\n\nNow, developing future philosophers through his school was only half of his initial plan, he also was committed to continuing the work of his friend and mentor, Socrates. As we talked about last episode, he wrote the apology, which was the story of Socrates\u2019s trial, defense and conviction. But he was no where near done preserving his name. See, Plato was another one of these brilliant philosophers that chose to write down their work in an entertaining and sometimes poetic way to try to get people to listen to the ideas underneath the story. And Plato was\u2026really good at it. he was a philosopher, but many historians say that his writing is THE BEST writing in all of ancient Greece\u2026and i agree\u2026you have to read some of this stuff guys\u2026you can even buy them in paperback at Barnes and Noble\u2026even the modern translations keep your interest\u2026which is saying something\u2026considering it was meant to keep the interest of people that lived thousands of years ago. It\u2019s really high quality stuff. A lot of what made it so entertaining was that he wrote it as a story, with people just having normal conversations about things, and then eventually casually weaving in a philosophical discussion about some abstract idea. Plato would use REAL PEOPLE\u2026REAL NAMES\u2026Real personalities of people that lived at the time and use them as a mouthpiece to deliver his philosophy. A guy I went to school with said to me once that Plato\u2019s writing is like crossover fan-fiction. And its true! This is a great modern comparison\u2026for anyone that doesn\u2019t know, crossover fan fiction would be like if a crazed fan wrote a short story about Edward and Bella from the Twilight franchise enrolling in Hogwarts and meeting the cast of Harry Potter. Plato would have different philosophers and public figures having conversations that they never actually had, sometimes even people that didn\u2019t even live at the same time. Plato would, often times, need a character in these stories that people could perceive as the quintessentially WISE person\u2026and whenever that demand arose, he chose to evoke the name of the wisest person he knew\u2026Socrates\u2026He was consciously typecasting Socrates as a WISE person in every book so that the legacy of Socrates would be that he was a wise person\u2026kind of like how certain actors are typecast in modern movies\u2026like if I saw Michael Cera walking down the street, I would instantly jump to a conclusion and assume he is a meek, reserved person even though that\u2019s based on absolutely nothing\u2026I don\u2019t know Michael Cera\u2026really the only thing that tells me is he plays that character really well\u2026Plato was no doubt deliberately doing this in the case of Socrates, making him the WISE man in his dialogues to leave a legacy. Unfortunately, it led to a little bit of confusion\u2026Socrates was a philosopher himself, and he never wrote anything down\u2026so by making him the central character in a dialogue that\u2019s actually conveying Plato\u2019s philosophy, it can sometimes be difficult to discern which views are the views of Socrates and which are the views of Plato himself. 27 treatises. And all these are separated down into 3 distinct periods based on when they were written \u2026and each of these periods mark large changes in Plato\u2019s way of thinking and the subject matters covered. see, in Plato\u2019s early dialogues he deals with issues that concerned Socrates exclusively \u2026 not only that, he addressed them in the way Socrates would have addressed them\u2026his Socratic method\u2026its almost like he felt an obligation to carry on Socrates\u2019s legacy after he was put to death\u2026but then throughout the chronology of his writing, the Socrates in his writing starts dealing with more issues of government\u2026metaphysical claims etc. the fact that Socrates changes and is a completely different person in one writing as opposed to another, it shows the progression of Plato as a philosopher\u2026and really it doesn\u2019t really matter that much. Socrates wasn\u2019t the kind of guy that had a set of unfaltering beliefs anyway\u2026remember he vehemently swore that he knew nothing and was always trying to get to the bottom of what things actually were. What Plato has succeeded in doing in this case is to keep the spirit of Socrates alive\u2026the ever changing ever questioning spirit of the Socratic method.\n\nAn example of this continuation of Socrates and the way he did philosophy lies in one of his treatises from the early years called the symposium\u2026The symposium is one of Plato\u2019s most famous works\u2026and keep in mind\u2026all the characters from this dialogue are written by Plato\u2026just revel in the sheer genius of how well he encapsulates each of the characters and the reputation that they had, writing YEARS later probably DECADES later depending on who you believe. And its not like he had a private stenographer sitting in the corner at the dinner party\u2026try recounting a conversation you had 15 years ago! the word symposium means, a drinking party\u2026Plato writes about a fancy dinner party where several different people take turns after dinner standing up in front of the group and giving their thoughts on and trying to get to one of these deep Socratic definitions of the concept of love\u2026how it starts..what the end goal is when you love someone\u2026whether it overall is actually a benefit to mankind or not\u2026\n\nAll kinds of people were at this dinner party\u2026 generals like Alcibiades, playwrights like Aristophanes and most notably, Socrates. Aristophanes, being a playwright that writes comedy gives a quasi humorous and metaphorical account for what love is. he talks about a time when men and women were actually fused together, two heads four arms four legs and we would roll around everywhere\u2026There were three sexes back then apparently..all male, all female, and the \u201candrogynous,\u201d which was half male, half female. The all males were said to have descended from the sun, the females from the earth and the androgynous couples from the moon. Apparently we were a little feisty when we had four arms and we tried to take over the god realm, and Zeus was JUST ABOUT to throw lightning at us and kill us all, but he decided\u2026he wanted to, but he didn\u2019t want to deprive himself of all the offering and sacrifices that humans were giving him, so he just set his lightning bolts from kill to stun mode and separated us in half. That way they could get TWICE the offerings they were getting before.\n\nAristophanes refers to sexual attraction or erotic love as the desire humans have to find their other half\u2026they may seek it out for their entire lives without finding it, but the urges and feelings that attach us to people is our way of trying to get back our other half that was taken from us. Apparently this is also why people often say that they feel \u201cwhole\u201d when they are in love with someone. To put it another way, Aristophanes believes love is actually a quest\u2026a pursuit to fill areas that you\u2019re lacking in that were once yours. Later on in the dinner party, Socrates doesn\u2019t agree with him\u2026he agrees that it is a quest, but he doesn\u2019t think we love something because at one point it belonged to us\u2026he thinks we love something because we find it beautiful or good. Socrates breaks down the concept of love and tries to distill it down to its essence, as he would \u2026he claims to have gotten his enlightened account of what love is from a conversation he once had with an older priestess \u2026he explains it like this\u2026man seeks immortality\u2026we cant live forever\u2026that is certain\u2026so what we all do is seek other alternative forms of immortality\u2026.and Plato saw these alternative forms as coming down to one of 3 things\u2026firstly, through children you know, a little piece of you is passed on through them and then again through their children, secondly, by doing some really noteworthy thing that gets you famous and written down in the history books, or thirdly you can create some body of work that is evergreen or important enough that future generations hold it up in high regard, like Plato\u2019s symposium ironically enough. all three of these things are creating offspring\u2026either physical offspring made with someone you love or intellectual offspring where we use our desire for being loved to motivate us to achieve these things\u2026almost like we\u2019re peacocks\u2026 and the things we accomplish intellectually are colorful feathers we\u2019re adding to our tail. now these people that we want love from, we think they are beautiful, but to Plato they\u2019re just inferior copies of an IDEAL form of beauty, which we will touch on later, but what hes basically saying is that we accomplish what we choose to accomplish in life, our careers, our cars, our children all out of a love of beauty that we then transmute into motivation to get things done.\n\nI know some of you are saying\u2026well that isn\u2019t love\u2026that is lust, or whatever you want to call it. You\u2019re right. Plato thought that this was only the first step on a staircase of love. love can be broken down into a few different stages, each stage leading to the next stage and eventually coming to a head at the appreciation of the IDEAL form of beauty itself. it starts with a love of the person\u2019s body, or as Plato put it \u201ceros\u201d\u2026or exotic love..both sexual attraction or thinking that person is an attractive person that\u2019s what we just talked about. he says that after a while of this, you eventually realize that someone you think is beautiful has a lot in common with all other people who are beautiful, therefore making this really hot person, not as much of a rare Pokemon. There\u2019s tons of them. Then once you realize this, you realize that all the variance that the body can have that makes it beautiful is nothing in comparison to the variance and things that make the soul beautiful, or more simply to us modern folk, their personality. then, the yardstick you use to measure whether someone is beautiful or not has everything to do with their personality, even if that personality exists inside of a mangled or ugly body. Eventually, you begin to transcend EVEN the personality and stop loving individual people that inhabit an individual body, and you start to love even broader things like concepts themselves. You fall in love with things like the arts or laws, or biology or things like that and then finally, at the end of the staircase, you fall in love with the ideal FORM of beauty itself. Socrates says that if it is possible to live life anywhere, it is here. because when you are in love with a single human being, you are vulnerable. They could leave you\u2026or die\u2026or go live on a farm upstate like my dog did\u2026it is a PAINFUL life of servitude this person, whereas loving the form of beauty itself you never feel vulnerable because it is eternal and unchanging. its never gonna give you up OR let you down. But here\u2019s the problem, it will NEVER love you back\u2026and you know this. It is a perfect, eternal structure\u2026it doesn\u2019t have any use for love\u2026a quest searching for something you\u2019re lacking or whatever your definition is. This is what is known as, Platonic love. And it wasn\u2019t just intended to be used to find a life partner, we have e-harmony for that now. it was also supposed to be used to look past superficial properties of laws or people in government or even things like bridges. do these things just appear to be beautiful\u2026or of substance\u2026or should their worth be judged by the qualities that actually vary between them and other things. I could dress up like a UFC fighter\u2026i could wear the affliction shirts and i could stack some encyclopedias on the bill of a hat so it is as flat as a UFC fighters hat\u2026but examine me a little closer, and I DO MEAN A LITTLE, cause I\u2019m not fooling anyone and you\u2019ll find that i don\u2019t know how to fight\u2026at all\u2026and Dana white is never gonna book me for a main event fight, because there is no substance behind the look.\n\neventually he got tired of dealing with just moral issues and started trying to answer questions like the presocratics were trying to answer\u2026about what the cosmos is made out of and how did it get here. in a funny way, he arrived at the same conclusion about both. morals and concepts like justice and beauty, are eternal and not defined by the perception of the person seeing them\u2026and he thought that nature and the things we saw were the exact same way\u2026eternal, unchanging and not based on perception.\n\nPlato agreed with Socrates that finding the eternal definition of things like justice was an extremely important thing, because how can you philosophize about something accurately if you don\u2019t even understand the definition of the concepts you\u2019re philosophizing about. how can you talk about justice, without knowing exactly what justice is. to Plato, the entire quest of trying to find the definitions about these things should be done through the Socratic method\u2026two or more people discussing something, with no malicious intentions or horse in the race, but just giving their best guess based on their own experiences and having the other guy nitpick it relentlessly. but he also asks the question, my guess is after being completely frustrated after years of wondering what anything actually is, that\u2026if we arrived at the perfect, eternal definition of justice, beauty or whatever, how would we even be able to recognize that it was the end all, be all perfect FORM of it, and not just some flawed perception like we usually have. But not just the perfect FORM of moral concepts, how about the perfect FORM of everyday objects\u2026what is a tree? exactly? what is a photograph? exactly? right? is there a perfect definition of what the essence of a tree is? Plato thought just as there\u2019s an illusive difficult to define version of what justice is, there\u2019s an illusive difficult to define version of what a tree is, or all physical objects for that matter\u2026 a PERFECT tree..and that all the trees we see around us are just inferior copies of that perfect tree. To put it another way, He describes it like this, when we see a tree, we know its a tree and can recognize a tree when we see one, but trees are all very different\u2026no two of them are they same\u2026one may have a knot here, or a random branch there\u2026some trees have one kind of bark or one kind of leaves..there\u2019s a lot of different kinds of trees , but we still recognize it as a tree because it has a sort of a\u2026 \u201ctree-e-ness\u201d\u2026uh, for anyone wondering\u2026 if it means anything, I\u2019m the moron that decided to use \u201ctree\u201d as an example so id have to say the word tree-e-ness\u2026Plato in his work used dogs and dogginess as an example but anyway, we can recognize tree-e-ness, you know that thing that makes a tree a tree. We recognize it at some level and attach a definition to a tree. So if we analyze what the essence of a tree is long enough, we can understand what a \u201ctree\u201d is by definition. right? We can conceive of what the \u201cperfect\u201d tree really is, but does it actually exist anywhere in the world? no. Plato thought that that perfect tree, along with the perfect forms of EVERYTHING else that exists, including the concepts of justice and beauty, exist in a magical world of forms, that is completely separate from the material world that we live in. Humans cant see or smell or touch the world of forms, but they can think really hard for a really long time about the definitions of one of these things or concepts and access the world of forms through reason. Not only that, but to Plato, the world of forms is the TRUE reality, and that the entire world we live in and everything in it, including people, and trees and dogs \u2026they\u2019re all inferior copies of the quintessential person quintessential tree and quintessential dog that exists in the world of forms. This concept is known as his Theory of Forms, its a pretty strange way of looking at the world and all the things in it, so to try to put it into context and to explain what he means,\n\nThis is usually the point in the podcast where I go into some long winded example that no one understands trying to relate the material to you guys, but luckily for me\u2026Plato did it for me! except, his isn\u2019t incomprehensible at all, it\u2019s actually so genius its the thing he\u2019s most known for. It\u2019s called his Allegory of the Cave. Here\u2019s a quote from it:\n\n\u201cBehold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. \u201c\n\nTo Plato, typical human existence is a pretty depressing thing.\n\nSo, imagine if from the moment you were born you were tied up and held prisoner inside of a dark cave, being forced to face the dark back wall of the cave. Now, some translations say the light source is a fire, some say it is the sun, but either way shadows are cast of you and the other prisoners tied up around you onto the back wall of the cave\u2026now also, for the sake of including all the other things in the world, Plato includes that there is also a pathway between you and the fire where people walk by every so often and hold up everyday items, like a tree, or a dog\u2026etc\u2026so that the shadow of the tree or the dog is cast on the back wall of the cave. Plato says that if you talked to the prisoners, they would have no idea about the world that\u2019s going on behind them\u2026from birth the only thing they\u2019ve ever seen or known about are the shadows of the actual items being cast on the cave wall\u2026he compares the everyday experience that humans have\u2026seeing a tree or a dog in the real world is like seeing the shadow of the actual item on the cave wall. He continues by saying that if a prisoner manages to untie himself and turn around and look at the actual items and see the fire\u2026or in some translations he would leave the cave and eventually see the sun, which symbolizes complete truth\u2026 he would be confused and his eyes would strain at the sun, and most likely he would turn back around and stick to the shadows because its the existence hes known for so long. Not mention he\u2019d probably feel really dumb that hes been sitting there since he was a baby and could\u2019ve untied himself this whole time and didn\u2019t realize it. Plato thought that everything on earth that we had the ability to perceive with our senses had a corresponding Form in the world of forms. When we use our senses to perceive something, like when we see it, smell it touch it, we are essentially seeing shadows on the cave wall. The only true way to know what something is, is to \u201cuntie yourself\u201d and turn around to see them for what they actually are, and the way you do that is through reason and thought. Remember how philosophers like Democritus and Empedocles were just trying to find a compromise that accounted for the changing world we perceive, as opposed to Parminides idea that the world is eternal and unchanging? Well, with his theory of forms, Plato was basically doing the same thing. The material world that we live in and perceive, or the shadows on the cave wall\u2026is seemingly changing, but true reality is in a completely separate, eternal and unchanging world, the world of forms. He thought it was a philosophers job to identify as many of these forms as they can in life. Being able to untie yourself and see the truth for what it actually is gives that person a unique perspective of understanding that no one else around him possesses. It\u2019s kind of like watching a football game with a pro football player sitting right next to you. You guys are both watching the same exact game, but he sees SO MUCH MORE than you do, he understands subtleties and strategy that you are completely ignorant to. Plato thought true wisdom did this with everything we see.\nhere\u2019s another quote from the republic about a prisoner that manages to untie themselves:\n\n\u201cwhile still blinking through the gloom, and before he has become sufficiently accustomed to the environing darkness, he is compelled in courtrooms or elsewhere to contend about the shadows of justice or the images that cast the shadows and to wrangle in debate about the notions of these things in the minds of those who have never seen justice itself?\u201d\n\nNow, its important to note that a lot of really smart people that don\u2019t think Plato LITERALLY thought that a separate world existed with perfect forms of everything just floating around everywhere. They say he probably was just stating in a melodramatic way that concepts like justice or beauty exist independent of just actions or beautiful things\u2026human beings commonly mistake just actions and definition of justice as being the same thing. I mean, he did speak of a different heaven like world\u2026but really he may have just been marking a contrast between considering what is a just action here and now and what is the eternal unchanging definition of justice regardless of time and place\n\nBut there is one glaring problem with his \u2026theory of forms and the \u2026allegory of the cave\u2026how can we even know what the ideal form of anything is? how can we know the difference between reasoning to an imperfect form of a tree or reasoning to a perfect form of a tree. Plato says that even though we don\u2019t realize it, we are all born with knowledge of everything in the world of forms, or as he put it, what we call learning is only a process of recollection. He thought that human beings could be broken down into two separate parts, the body and the soul. the body is responsible for the inferior senses, the things we use to perceive the world around us in a flawed way. the soul, on the other hand, has the ability to reason, and we use the soul to perceive the world of forms. He thought that our soul is eternal and at one point lived in the world of forms before we were born and really wants to go back. so, when we see a tree with our senses in the everyday world, we can recognize that its a tree but we need to use our soul, or reason to remember exactly what a tree is.\n\n\u201cCome now, try to tell me how long each side of this will be. the side of this is two feet. what about each side of the one which is its double?\n\nObviously Socrates it will be twice the length.\n\nyou see Meno that I am not teaching the boy anything but all I do is question him and now he thinks he knows the length of the line on which an eight foot figure is based do you agree?\n\nI do.\n\nAnd does he know?\n\nCertainly not\n\nHe thinks it is a line twice the length\n\nYes\n\nWatch him now recollecting things in order as one must recollect, tell me boy do you say that a figure double the size is based on a line double the length? Now I mean such a figure as this not long on one side and short on the other but equal in every direction like this one and double the size, that is, eight feet\u2026\u201d\n\nHe goes on for a while never teaching the boy anything, but asking questions and getting the boy to arrive at new conclusions all on his own. This is a great example of the Socratic method of questioning at work, and a great example of Socrates being a midwife for ideas like we talked about last episode. You can really see in this story that the boy had no idea what the answer was before he questioned him, and then Socrates gives birth to new ideas, just as he claimed to do when questioning people on the streets of Athens. Plato thought this story and the fact that the slave boy was told nothing, but was able to arrive at new understanding was proof that were born with total knowledge of everything in the world of forms and that understanding the world of forms is just a process of using your soul\u2019s ability to reason to remember them.\n\nThe theory of forms may seem a little weird. That\u2019s because it is. If you gave him enough time, Plato himself may have agreed with you. The theory went through several different stages where certain aspects of it changed throughout his life\u2026no doubt because other philosophers would argue about it with him\u2026he\u2019d recognize there was a problem with it and try to adapt to account for it. but He was the first one to designate what the path to having true knowledge was. Yeah, he was addressing the sophist idea of relativism which led him to base his thoughts on something eternal like the theory of forms, but this was a breakthrough in Epistemology. Epistemology, simply put is what do we know and how do we know it, and Although we\u2019ve heard several other philosophers echo the concept of the senses being inferior to reason when trying to arrive at knowledge of the world we live in, his explanation for why it is better really sets him apart from them, and because of this he is usually credited with single-handedly laying the groundwork for 17th century rationalism.\n\nNow, Plato wasn\u2019t done changing philosophy yet. He even had a lot to say about the role of government in a civilized society. Plato was an aristocratic elitist that hated democracy, the conviction of Socrates probably added to this..his thinking was just like there\u2019s an ideal form of justice, or beauty, Plato says there is an ideal form of government, and he crafts a sort of utopia laying out exactly what the ideal government would be and why it should be that way.\nThe biggest problem he saw was with the leadership that is typically elected to office\u2026here he is giving his account of why leaders never seem to get things done.\n\n\u201cSuch was the conviction I had when I arrived in Italy and Sicily for the first time. when I arrive and saw what they call there the \u201chappy life\u201d a life filled with Italian and Syracusan banquets, with men gorging themselves twice a day and never sleeping alone at night, and following all the other customs that go with this way of living I was profoundly displeased. For no man under heaven who has cultivated such practices from his youth could possible grow up to be wise, so miraculous a temper is against nature or become temperate or indeed acquire any other part of virtue.\u201d\n\nPeople that are born into a rich lifestyle of indulgence, in Plato\u2019s eyes were among the worst that could possibly govern a population.\n\n\u201cI saw clearly in regard to all states now existing that without exception their system of government is bad. Their constitutions are almost beyond redemption\u2026.Hence I was forced to say in the praise of the correct philosophy that it affords a vantage point from which we can discern in all cases what is just for communities and for individuals, and accordingly the human race will not see better days until either the stock of those who rightly and genuinely follow philosophy acquire political authority, or else the class who have political control are led by some dispensation of providence to become real philosophers.\u201d\n\nPlato\u2019s idea of what an ideal city is starts at the beginning of the republic where the character Socrates comes across a guy named Thrasimicus\u2026who tells Socrates that morality is nothing more than a set of rules forced upon the weak by strong people who have the power to impose them. he thinks if you can break the law and get away with it you should and if you can change rules and get a bunch of people to follow suit, you should do that too. He finishes by saying that a man who acts"}, "episode_5": {"date": "2014-4-26", "text": "Posted on April 26, 2014\nEpisode 5 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 5 on Aristotle\u2019s Ethics.\n\nHello everyone, its me Stephen West this is Philosophize This! Today we\u2019re talking about Aristotle. Now, its not crazy to think that some of you guys have heard some stuff about Aristotle before, he\u2019s a man of great stature in the philosophical world. Maybe you even started listening to this thinking, \u201cAristotle! We\u2019re gonna learn about biological classification, his system of logic, his scientific method\u201d and you\u2019d be right. we\u2019re just not gonna learn about it today\u2026 that\u2019ll be next weeks episode in part 2\u2026 that\u2019s right, as you probably guessed because I just said it, Aristotle will be broken down into 2 parts. And THIS WEEK we\u2019re gonna learn about what Aristotle thought the best way to live life was. By the end of this episode, you\u2019re gonna know exactly why you\u2019re miserable. You\u2019re gonna know all the mistakes you\u2019ve made up until this point. Obviously, I\u2019m joking. But Aristotle wasn\u2019t, he really thought he came up with THE WAY to live life, and even if you\u2019re happy in your current existence, if you follow Aristotle\u2019s plan, you could be even happier! It all starts when you\u2019re really young\u2026 most people spend their days in their teens and early twenties with no real direction. You know, there\u2019s no definitive end goal in mind or if they have one its pretty uncertain\u2026 or vague and they spend most of their free time doing recreational things, having fun gaining experiences.. being young. If you were an exception to this rule, more power to you, but realize that people say things like \u201cwhat are you worried about.. you\u2019re young!\u201d for a reason. Young people might make a plan to go to the movies.. or a plan ride quads around in the sand dunes.. you know recreational things that don\u2019t have much to do with bringing some distant master plan into fruition. In other words, Most young people are concerned with short term plans\u2026not their 401k plan. But for the most part what ends up happening is the older you get the more you begin considering your future\u2026you start putting more thought into the decisions you make\u2026 even down to random everyday things\u2026 like, you know, your posture or how you treat people..you start to do things for a specific purpose, and although you may still slate aside a couple weeks for a vacation once a year, its a far cry from your days of getting drunk, staying up all night and waking up in your friends bathtub.\n\nSo, Aristotle thought we needed a plan for our life if we wanted to achieve a certain level of mastery for living life. And I\u2019m sure all of us can understand what its like to try to get good at something. I think whenever you\u2019re achieving mastery at anything, the more proficient you get at something, the more purpose you have behind every individual action you take. for example, i was watching a video of Gordon Ramsey cooking scrambled eggs the other day\u2026and naively I was thinking\u2026 I cook scrambled eggs everyday\u2026 I mean he may know how to cook a crunch-berry souffle or something but I\u2019ve probably made scrambled eggs as many times as he has\u2026cause I\u2019ve made them every day of my life. i mean I have a whole system\u2026like I crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them i add salt and pepper\u2026 I put a little grass fed butter in the bottom of the pan\u2026 you know I leave it there for a while\u2026 usually come back with a fire extinguisher to try to prevent damage to the house things like that. Watching Gordon Ramsey do it\u2026 I felt like a complete moron. Firstly, he doesn\u2019t put butter at the bottom of the pan, he just cracks the eggs into the pan and puts the butter on top of is because it gives it a \u201clovely velvety finish\u201d to the eggs\u2026 also, he doesn\u2019t add salt and pepper to the eggs beforehand because the seasoning starts to break down the eggs and turns it into \u201csomething quite watery and dreadful\u201d Look Gordon Ramsey my eggs may not have had a velvety finish to them but they weren\u2019t watery and dreadful. I am offended at this point. He says to never whisk the egg beforehand, you whisk it in the pan because you don\u2019t want to \u201cbreak it down\u201d beforehand. And then he has this super advanced method of cooking where he just keeps putting the pan on the stove and then taking it off\u2026constantly stirring it \u201clike a fine risotto\u2026 on the heat \u2026off the heat\u2026on the heat\u2026off the heat\u201d Then he adds some stuff called creme fresh to his eggs so they don\u2019t overcook\u2026what is creme fresh? with my newly lowered scrambled egg self esteem I Googled it\u2026 and apparently its like a french version of sour cream with a little more fat. All these things that I take for granted\u2026 all these things I do completely mindlessly while cooking scrambled eggs for no real purpose, Gordon Ramsey, through experience and wisdom has achieved a much higher level of mastery at cooking scrambled eggs and is therefore much better at it.\n\nThe same rules apply to becoming better at life. Or better at living life. You start to develop priorities, you find out what is important to you\u2026 and eventually you do almost everything for a purpose\u2026and usually the purpose you do any random thing for is to nurture the positive growth of your goals\u2026 like being healthy\u2026 living a long life, making a lot of money\u2026etc. eventually we combine all these various things we prioritize as a sort of rulebook for living\u2026 a set of values that we live by. Aristotle calls this \u201ca plan\u201d and encourages people to make one of these plans\u2026\n\nAristotle was born in 384 BC\u202615 years after Socrates had been put to death in Athens\u2026but when Aristotle arrived in Athens and enrolled at Plato\u2019s academy as a student, he no doubt heard all about Socrates\u2019s final days from Plato, as well as his famous saying that \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d in response, Aristotle did Socrates one better. he said that an unplanned life is not worth examining. what point is living a life if we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re trying to do and why or how we\u2019re gonna to get there? we need a plan!but not just a set of priorities\u2026 we need to find out how to use these priorities to distinguish certain goals that we want to achieve and figure out how we\u2019re going to achieve them. but even that\u2019s not good enough for Aristotle\u2026.not only should you have a plan\u2026but you should have HIS PLAN. THE PLAN. To Aristotle, There is only one fully correct plan for life, and if you don\u2019t follow it then you may be happy, but not as happy as you could be. Now, The idea of there being one\u2026 single ultimate plan that every human has to follow is a relatively foreign idea in modern times\u2026and for good reason. I mean to us, It seems like a waste of time to agonize over what the ultimate goal of life is, because its obviously a glaring and important question that all of us ask at some point\u2026and if there was a right answer, we probably would have figured it out by now, probably thousands of years ago. so we end up just applying our own meaning to our life and deeming it to be the best for us. but when we use terms like \u201cwhat is the BEST end goal to life?\u201d we\u2019re implying that there are better and worse end goals, but what makes them better or worse? what metric are we using to determine what is better?\n\nif one person deems the purpose of life to be the pursuit of knowledge and a completely different person thinks the purpose of life is finding a way to use your brain as little as possible, how can these two opposite world views have the same end goal? Aristotle thought they did if you analyzed them deeper.\n\nAristotle thinks the ultimate end goal of life\u2026what we should all shoot for\u2026 is \u201cliving well\u201d. Now real quickly lets establish a few things about living life\u2026There are a variety of things we do, solely for the sake of staying alive. Like eating, drinking, exercising, things like that. There are other things we do because we think that if we do them, well be able to make living life easier or better in some way. For example, you could educate yourself, its not necessary to stay alive, but we think that by expanding our mind and knowing about a variety of different subjects, we can use that knowledge to live a better life, not to mention the satisfaction we get from constantly growing as people. We can think of these two different types of things\u2026 as things that we do just to Live and things that we do to live well,and we can think of both of them as end goals that we hope to achieve that are in line with the priorities we developed earlier\u2026In fact, we could even break it down further, you only really need one of these things\u2026right? living well. you can\u2019t live well if you aren\u2019t alive, so things we do just to stay alive\u2026really are all requisites on our path to achieving the goal of living well. Aristotle talks about how everything we do is either an end\u2026or a means to an end\u2026we either do something for the sake of getting something else, or we do something solely for its own sake. Now\u2026if \u201cliving well\u201d is one of our goals in life, is there anything we want after that? Are we living well for the sake of achieving some further goal? Aristotle didn\u2019t think so. He thinks that we live well just for the sake of living well\u2026therefore, living well, to Aristotle is the ultimate goal of life. Some people may disagree, but I think its pretty reasonable. Almost everyone I\u2019ve ever asked what they want in life they say they just want to be happy, and I know that evidence is anecdotal\u2026but the plural form of anecdote is data.\n\nAristotle says that there are a lot of things, as humans, that we desire in this world\u2026or things that we think are good\u2026like we said in our earlier example\u2026one person may say \u201cthe pursuit of knowledge\u201d\u2026one person may say the pursuit of using your brain as little as possible\u201d\u2026and all of these things we think are good are really just our own little personalized path we\u2019re taking with all the paths eventually arriving at a single final destination, which is what you actually want \u201cliving well\u201d. Modern translations of Aristotle\u2019s term for Living well say the best modern translation for what he was talking about is our concept of \u201chappiness\u201d. Living well is happiness and happiness is what we all seek, whether its through pursuing knowledge or not pursuing knowledge, both of those people still want happiness. the difference is what brings them happiness. Aristotle didn\u2019t just think this was the case\u2026 he thought that it was self-evident that this is what the ultimate end goal of life is, because when you ask someone why they want happiness, they can never really give you an answer. so they\u2019re obviously not doing it for the sake of getting something else. the only way you could really say that you wanted happiness for a REASON is if happiness was a requisite for achieving some OTHER ultimate goal, but the way Aristotle saw it, there was no such thing\u2026happiness or living well WAS the ultimate goal.\n\nNow, as I was saying before, what brings us happiness varies from person to person. I mean, by and large, we experience happiness when we get what we want. so because one person might be made happy by pursuing knowledge and someone else might be miserable pursuing knowledge\u2026there\u2019s no cookie cutter recipe for happiness right? Aristotle thought that even though our paths to happiness were so astronomically different, if you distill it down enough, we really all want the same things too. And before we continue, real quick, its important to know that Aristotle thought that things we think of as \u201cgood\u201d are the same as things we think of as \u201cdesirable\u201d. The two terms were synonymous to him.\n\nAristotle thought as humans we are all individuals. We have individual upbringings individual experiences and individual perspectives. Its Based on our experiences \u2026that we determine what is desirable. This is how you can explain the difference between someone who thinks its desirable to pursue knowledge, or not to pursue knowledge, or to be the greatest tennis player in the world, or to strap dynamite to yourself and glorify god, all of these things are based on things we\u2019ve deemed to be desirable because of our individual backgrounds. But even if most of these desires differ from person to person, as human beings, we all have similar desires\u2026like being able to eat or drink or sleep, etc. On that same note, we all desire things that we don\u2019t actually need to stay alive. I mean\u2026we desire to have the double bacon cheeseburger, but we don\u2019t need it. We desire to get a big promotion and date a supermodel, but we don\u2019t need it. we think if we had these things they would be good for us and enrich our lives\u2026so we desire them\u2026hence Aristotle idea that if we see something as desirable we see it as good. But like in the case of the double bacon cheeseburger, which is also my favorite Nancy Drew book BTW, the case of the double bacon cheeseburger\u2026 what we desire and we see as good, is not ACTUALLY good for us. The double bacon cheeseburger is a good example of how easily something can seem like its good for us at a particular time or place, but at a later time and place it may seem\u2026 completely terrible for us. and this dynamic applies to most things, even your worldview\u2026like if the guy that relentlessly pursues NEVER using his brain or learning anything as the most desirable thing one day..lets say some other day hes trying to memorize the ingredients of different alcoholic drinks so he can pass his bartenders exam\u2026pursuing knowledge and using his brain turns out to be really good at that time and place. Aristotle uses this fact to mark a distinction between things that we think are desirable that may vary from time to time, and things that we think are desirable that never vary\u2026like things we need to survive. This is another way of marking the contrast between two different types of desires, wants and needs\u2026both are things we desire, but they\u2019re not the same thing. Aristotle referred to these things as either acquired desires, or wants\u2026.desires we\u2019ve acquired based on our experiences during our lives\u2026and natural desires\u2026or needs which are desires we were born with because we are human and all humans have them regardless of background. He says that the only things that are really \u201cgood\u201d for you are things that fulfill your natural desires, because these things we need whether we are conscious of the need or not, whereas everything else you desire falls into the acquired desires and only appear to be good at the time.\n\nThe one correct ultimate end goal or plan for living well\u2026the plan that brings us happiness is a plan that includes us attaining all the things that are actually \u201cgood\u201d for us to have. and because all of these natural desires we have are the same for everyone\u2026because we are all human and share the same natural desires of things like food, shelter, water, sleep\u2026what is truly good for one person is actually truly good for everyone. that\u2019s why Aristotle says happiness is the same in the case of all human beings and that\u2019s why he refers to all of these things that fulfill our natural desires as \u201creal goods\u201d. Now remember that term, real goods. We all have our own unique individual paths that we take to try to acquire all these real goods\u2026i mean Donald Trump\u2019s plan to secure things like food clothing shelter is obviously much different than a panhandling homeless guy\u2026and Aristotle would say these differences definitely make some plans better than others. But remember\u2026Aristotle thought there was one ultimate plan that was the best you could do. Its one that involves getting every real good in the right order and quantity while simultaneously making it possible for us to seek things we want, but do not necessarily need that will enrich our lives.\n\nSo, if we want to achieve true happiness by using Aristotle\u2019s plan, it seems pretty important to figure out what these real good are. I mean, if the main thing we need to be happy are all these real goods, we should at least make a list of them\u2026we should have them laminated or something.\n\nAristotle separates these real goods down into a few parts. He says\u2026\n\n\u201cHuman beings are animals with the unique ability to think and reason.\u201d\n\nBecause we are animals with a machine like body that needs maintenance, some of these real goods help us with our bodily needs. These \u2026bodily goods are made up of\u2026vigor, vitality, health and sensual pleasures. Aristotle says that even though we go about getting these things in different ways, we not only share all of these desires with every other human, we actually share all of these desires with every other animal in the animal kingdom. Animals avoid pain and seek pleasure, as well as vigor vitality and health. Now, if living well is the ultimate end goal then Vigor vitality and health are three requisites on the road to living well\u2026they\u2019re means to an end\u2026but to achieve even one of them is a goal in itself, so there are requisites for achieving these things too. To have vigor, vitality and health, you need five things\u2026 food, drink, clothing, sleep and shelter. Now, when you break vigor vitality and health into these 5 tangible or easily identifiable things, its easy to see how they\u2019re extremely interrelated\u2026like it doesn\u2019t matter how much food or drink you have, you cant be healthy if you don\u2019t sleep\u2026and it doesn\u2019t matter how much sleep you have, you aren\u2019t going to have much vigor if you\u2019re walking around naked with no home to go to at the end of the day. So\u2026 because it makes sense\u2026 and seemingly to make it easier for people like us studying him 2500 years later, Aristotle groups all of these EXTERNAL things that we need to achieve the bodily goods, he groups them all together and calls them external goods or wealth. Now, I could\u2019ve just said wealth was a requisite for living well, but that would\u2019ve been misleading. I wasn\u2019t trying to waste your time there, this was the definition of wealth for Aristotle\u2026and if I just said wealth, you\u2019d think it meant getting some generic burlap sack with a green dollar sign on it but wealth is no where near the same thing today.\n\nWhen I think about Aristotle and these needs that correspond with goals that we need to achieve on our path to happiness, It may be kind of dumb, but I remember it by thinking of the quote, early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise. we\u2019ve all heard our grandma tell us this before, but just in case it helps you remember, the early to bed and early to rise part reminds me of the 5 external goods, because \u201csleep\u201d is in there and when I think of sleep I think of being in a house with a sleeping cap on, so it reminds me of the other four external goods, and then the \u201cmakes a man healthy wealthy and wise\u201d part reminds me of the goals that harnessing those external goods is going to give me. Healthy reminds me of vigor vitality and health\u2026Wealthy reminds me of the 5 external goods and the Wise part, represents the next part were gonna talk about, because what we\u2019ve talked about so far isn\u2019t all you need to be happy. Remember, He says Human beings are animals with the unique ability to think and reason. Because we have the unique ability to think and reason, there are some real goods that we need to supplement and nurture our ability to reason. Instead of bodily goods, or external goods\u2026he grouped these into the \u201cgoods of the soul\u201d. Remember, at the time, this phenomena known as conscious thought wasn\u2019t connected to the brain, they thought that humans have a soul that controls our ability to think and reason, among other things. Now, when it comes to the goods of the soul, Aristotle thought to be truly happy we need to pursue a certain amount of knowledge. Were thinking, curious learning creatures by nature, and it seems like without acquiring knowledge, something would be lacking. Another one of these goods of the soul is the desire to be loved, or the desire for friendship. We are social creatures, like we talked about in the first episode\u2026you lock a guy in solitary confinement for six months and he goes crazy. We need interaction with other humans and Aristotle realized this. He thought that our desire to be respected for our favorable characteristics, like our skill at a particular thing, or our six-pack abs or whatever \u2026is closely related to being loved. Because of this, He said that as long as we are honored for a legitimate reason he would include the goods self-esteem and honor as part of the goods of the soul. He makes this distinction for good reason, this wouldn\u2019t apply to people that delusion of instant fame\n\nAristotle realized that all of these real goods are end goals in themselves, and when you\u2019re creating a road map for eventually arriving at living well and achieving happiness, it can be unclear as to how you even get to these end goals, so that you can then start your path to the ULTIMATE goal of living well. So Aristotle developed a way for us to consistently make correct decisions, too. Have you ever had a bad habit before? You ever eat something while driving and then when you get to where you\u2019re going you just leave the trash in your car? Ah\u2026Ill get it next time\u2026but then you don\u2019t? And then the next time you leave the trash in your car it just piles up over and over until your passengers seat looks like a yard sale? If you had a time lapse of your passengers seat it would be really obvious it was just one bad habitual decision being made over and over. It takes conscious effort to stop a bad habit, no matter what it is. Aristotle knew we were habitual creatures, when you have a bad habit, to stop doing it, you really are just training your mind in the direction of a more productive behavioral habit. It helps to have your mind on auto-pilot sometimes. But he knew this wasn\u2019t just restricted to negative habits, positive behaviors can be worked on too. Behaviors that end up making your life better and leading to the real goods we just talked about. It could be something as simple as eating in your car and not leaving the trash on the passengers seat\u2026if you see the banana peel on your seat, just take the initiative and throw it away, because each time you do it\u2026the next time you\u2019re staring down the banana peel and trying to find an excuse to leave it there, its slightly easier to just throw it away the next time. And if you leave it there, you are slightly weaker and it is slightly more difficult to throw it away next time.\n\nBut Aristotle didn\u2019t restrict this to just things like banana peels. He thought to live well and be happy we have to make habits out of virtuous behavior so that it comes almost as second nature. An example of this would be like if you\u2019re on a diet. You know you\u2019re not supposed to eat at McDonalds you\u2019re supposed to go into the woods and eat tree bark on your lunch\u2026and every time you\u2019re on your lunch break and you pull into the Mcdonalds drive through and concede to those impulses, the easier it is for you to do it the next day. Aristotle called these sorts of bad habits \u201cvices\u201d and thought that if you made a habit of acting virtuously, eventually it would be such an ingrained habit that it wouldn\u2019t take any effort at all to act virtuously. Aristotle thought this applies to all virtuous behavior, and that by making the habit of acting virtuously we will be naturally moving on the path to achieving these goals of things like \u201chonor or wealth\u201d and on our way to living well. He thought that we Needed virtuous behavior. and it makes sense. Mcdonalds is food, food is one of the 5 external goods, but without virtuous habits telling us what type of food to eat, how much of it to eat, at what time to eat it, etc\u2026we could technically stuff ourselves so full that we die. Although he didn\u2019t give the McDonalds example, he thought this same dynamic applies to most decisions in life.\n\nControlling yourself to not eat at McDonalds and stick to your diet is an example of Aristotle\u2019s virtue of temperance. The dictionary defines temperance as \u201cmoderation\u201d. And its easy to see that we run into most of our problems as humans, health wise or with relationships when we do things to excess. Moderation or temperance is a virtue. Temperance was one of two primary moral virtues Aristotle wrote about\u2026the other one was courage. Now, if you\u2019re like me, you hear the word courage and you think a soldier charging into battle\u2026or a kid going on a scary roller coaster.. but Aristotle thought of courage a little more broadly than that. He thought that doing things that cause us temporary discomfort or pain to ultimately achieve some higher good, is just another form of courage. Going to the gym and pushing yourself to the next level, would be courage to Aristotle. Challenging your brain, learning\u2026have you ever read a book that is just\u2026challenging? like your stomach hurts when you\u2019re reading it challenging? and you want to just stop and watch TV instead? Achieving mastery at anything is HARD WORK\u2026Aristotle called this courage.\n\nBoth temperance and courage involve using our ability to reason to distinguish between things that just look like they\u2019re good for us, and things that are ACTUALLY good for us. These were the two primary virtues that Aristotle laid out in his writing, then he laid out several other more minor ones but qualified them all as well as the real goods we are pursuing by acting virtuously with the idea that achieving them was based at least in some cases around luck. You know, if there is a mass drought or famine, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong to make that happen, it was just a bad roll of the dice that made you unable to get the external goods of food and drink. This applies to the goods of the soul too, to acquire a certain amount or kind of knowledge, it may just come down to whether you were lucky enough to have a teacher that could relay it to you effectively. Not having that isn\u2019t necessarily your fault. And how about diseases like cancer? Aristotle makes a case for why acting in a virtuous way is not good enough on its own\u2026acting virtuously may ultimately put you in a lot more favorable circumstances that allow luck to go your way, but luck definitely plays a role.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to misrepresent what Aristotle talked about as luck\u2026 its not just something that squanders virtuous behavior\u2026its not just something that takes someone who lives a perfectly moral life and starves them to death making good actions worse. It can also make people who are not virtuous temporarily happier like if a criminal wins the lottery, or it can even make bad decisions worse. Imagine if there are two people going through the McDonalds drive through\u2026both of them decide to eat their McChicken sandwiches on the way home, and for the sake of the example imagine they are really bad at eating and driving\u2026like holding the sandwich in front of their face so they cant see the road. One of them swerves off the road and crashes into a tree. The other one swerves off the road and crashes into a tree, but there happened to be a mother walking with her baby in a stroller in between them and the tree, and they kill both of them. BOTH DRIVERS have committed the same act of negligence, but because of bad luck, one of them has a completely different life than the other moving forward. This is an extreme example, but you guys can see how on a smaller scale this same dynamic can exist with non-virtuous behavior. And as a society, we would view justice in these two scenarios completely differently. Which brings me to the last thing Aristotle points out as things we need to make us happy\u2026justice. We cant pursue living well alone. We need other people and social interaction. Aristotle breaks down justice into two types\u2026distributive justice, which simply put, has to do with the elements of whatever system of government you are born into\u2026like, if you are born into a life of slavery or a society with tons of unjust laws it becomes really hard to live well. And the other kind is corrective justice, which involves correcting unfair distribution..like when individuals make non-virtuous decisions and don\u2019t exercise temperance, taking more than they need at the jeopardy of others. As you can probably see, it starts to get difficult to know what the correct thing to do is when trying to incentivize human progress with things like capitalism.\n\nA great quote by Aristotle that I use on a consistent basis that really sums up a lot of his ideas for living a good life is \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit\u201d. It really is an inspirational quote. It puts our own egos into context. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019ve done in the past\u2026like if you have a long list of accomplishments and successes, but you spend every day now doing nothing and making bad decisions\u2026Who are you exactly? On the other hand, you could\u2019ve messed up every single day before today\u2026you could\u2019ve been the type of person that leaves trash on the passengers seat of their car, but if for two weeks you take that trash to the trash can, what kind of person are you now? We\u2019ve all heard the stories about the people that smoke cigarettes for 30 years and then one day decide they\u2019re never going to touch them again. I realize it doesn\u2019t usually work that way, but if you looked at those people even one minute after they had made that decision to never smoke again\u2026do we consider them a smoker? Aristotle\u2019s quote is empowering. It really makes you think about who you are not from the standpoint of what you SAY your values are, but what you actually do consistently every day. A long time ago I read a book on the power of self-confidence\u2026and in the book they ask you to do an exercise that is really eye-opening when it comes to determining what kind of person you actually are, and I still try to do this exercise on a monthly basis. Philosophize This! If you knew you were going to die tonight, and you had to write your own obituary that would appear in the newspaper the next day. What would you write? What would your actions portray as your true values and how did you make the people around you feel?\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_6": {"date": "2014-4-28", "text": "Posted on April 28, 2014\nEpisode 10 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 10 on Epicurus.\u00a0\n\nHave you guys ever heard of a stoa? A stoa was a common structure in ancient Greek architecture that served a wide variety of purposes\u2026but most of the time it was just a place that people gathered. Imagine Two huge lines of Big\u2026Doric or Ionian Columns holding up a massive roof usually hundreds of feet long and positioned right in the middle of town\u2026offering people a little shelter from the elements while they do business\u2026merchants would sometimes set up shop\u2026artists would lay out their work for people to see\u2026people would sometimes hold religious ceremonies or hold a gathering in honor of some local prestigious war hero. In the second century AD there was a guy named Diogenes, and he was incredibly rich. The richest man in the town of Oenoanda\u2026the Mitt Romney in fact. He was so rich and believed so much in the philosophy of a guy named Epicurus who lived almost 500 years before him\u2026that he paid to have a giant wall built onto this stoa that was right in the middle of town. He built it where he knew everyone would be walking past it and they\u2019d all have have no choice but to look at it all day long\u2026and on this wall he carved in 25,000 words\u2026that\u2019s about 260 square meters of text\u2026and the text he chose to carve into this wall was the philosophy of Epicurus.\n\nMetaphysics\u2026epistemology\u2026ethics\u2026imagine going about your daily business and constantly having to look at some antiquated view of how to be a happier person written by a guy that never knew you and lived hundreds of years ago who is telling you that you\u2019re doing everything completely wrong. Must have seemed pretty pretentious by whatever guy thought \u2026yeah I\u2019m gonna carve some stuff into this WALL\u2026that\u2019s a good idea. On one of the sections of the wall\u2026at the very beginning there was a sort of prologue written by Diogenes explaining why he even put up the wall in the first place. He writes about being extremely troubled in his youth and that by studying Epicurus and his philosophy, he turned his life around\u2026 he achieved a level of tranquility he didn\u2019t even know was possible. He writes that the older he got, the more gratitude he had for the teachings of Epicurus and it was this gratitude that drove him to put up this wall\u2026He said he did it \u201cto help also those who come after us\u201d and \u201cto place therefore the remedies of salvation by means of this porch.\u201d because the wall he built was adjacent to a portico of this stoa. He said that if there were only one or two people who were lost or had been led astray in this human existence\u2026 He would just go and talk to them personally about Epicurus. Instead, he built a giant wall in the middle of a public place\u2026because as far as he saw it, everyone was lost.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello Everyone, I am Stephen West, this is philosophize this! and today we return to western philosophy, at least for a while\u2026and this episode is part 1 of a mini-series that months from now people will probably see as one block. And if you\u2019re listening to this months from now, in sequence, one after another\u2026this next part may seem kind of repetitive or contrived, but please be considerate of the fact that we\u2019re releasing one episode every\u2026two weeks almost and I need to re-up my gratitude for the love and support of the last two weeks. This show is growing rapidly and this audience is the nitrate fertilizer. Thank you for the donations. Thank you for following me on twitter and posting kind words on Facebook\u2026Thank you for the emails. Just know that I\u2019m constantly trying to find ways to become a more efficient person and shave time off of other obligations so that I can spend MORE time improving my craft and trying to bring you guys better shows. Your compassion makes me want nothing else in this world.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTen episodes ago we started talking about the Presocratic philosophers\u2026this group of really strange guys\u2026 with really strange ideas even by today\u2019s standards. None of them really knew what to think of this whole \u201cphilosophy\u201d thing. Nobody really had anything figured out that well. You had all different kinds of approaches\u2026Some of them like Thales just taught people informally, Pythagoras started a cult and super restrictive lifestyle\u2026Heraclitus buried himself in up to his neck manure for god\u2019s sake\u2026 but despite all their different methods of philosophizing and the different results they arrived at, they were all, generally speaking, talking about the same stuff\u2026the building blocks of metaphysics and epistemology. Then Socrates was born\u2026 and for the first time in the west you had someone using this tool of philosophy to try to discern what the most effective way to live life was. Then came Plato and Aristotle, two polymath geniuses, diametrically opposite in most ways but similar in the sense that philosophy as they pursued it was nearly impossible for the layman to relate to. There wasn\u2019t much salvation from your everyday problems in Plato telling you that there is a magical world of forms where a perfect form of everything exists\u2026you know\u2026some ruthless dictator may have just rode into town and sold you into slaver\u2026but don\u2019t worry! somewhere up in the sky there is a perfect form of that shovel you\u2019re gonna be using for the rest of your life\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeep in mind\u2026it really helped the longevity of your philosophy as well as it\u2019s ability to even get off the ground in the first place if it had a popular following\u2026and not just popularity among aspiring philosophers of the day, but of the average person. And really\u2026 part of what makes Plato and Aristotle so remarkable today is just how foreign the things they talked about were from the average thought process. I mean, Both of them had schools you needed to attend for years to fully grasp some of these concepts they were talking about. When it came to philosophy being useful to the average person, it must have seemed like it skipped a couple generations. So goes the infamous quote by Cicero that:\n\n\u201cSocrates however (was the) first (who) called philosophy down from heaven, and placed it in cities, and introduced it even in homes, and drove (it) to inquire about life and customs and things good and evil.\u201d\n\nBut When Aristotle died in 322BC, he wasn\u2019t the only supremely important figure to keel over and die recently. Just one year earlier, Alexander the Great died\u2026ending an uncharacteristically stable time in the life of the average citizen of Athens. The life of the average citizen was changing. Philosophy was changing. and the Hellenistic Age was beginning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe death of Alexander the Great is one of those moments in history where it\u2019s crazy to think about what history would look like today if things went down differently. He died very mysteriously and unexpectedly. And apparently Alexander the Great wasn\u2019t watching much daytime television in his day\u2026or he definitely would\u2019ve seen the hundreds of commercials from insurance companies and law firms telling him \u2026hes gonna fall off a ladder a die someday\u2026so make sure your family is protected. nope\u2026he died so suddenly, he hadn\u2019t even named a successor\u2026and nobody knew what to do. In the year 323 BC, suddenly the LARGEST and most powerful empire known to man at the time was just\u2026up for grabs\u2026and everyone was scrambling just trying to hold on to this really good thing they had going. Opinion was divided on what to do\u2026some people thought Alexanders half brother was the best way to go\u2026other people thought they should wait around for his unborn child to come of age\u2026long story short\u2026some people got murdered and chaos ensued. Constant War. Four Giant Dynasties made up of many kingdoms each, many of which just grasping at straws in this battle for succession. Even a couple hundreds years later, people were still reeling from the death of Alexander and jockeying for their own geo-political position.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe life of the average person during this time period changed dramatically with the death of Alexander. I mean\u2026depending on where you lived\u2026you might have a guy ride into town one week who tells you\u2026you guys are all under my rule now\u2026you are subservient to me. and the people would say OK\u2026and then the guy would leave and a few weeks later someone else would come into town and say, I killed that guy\u2026now I\u2019m your ruler you\u2019re all subservient to me now\u2026and so on and so forth. Things were very uncertain\u2026and uncertainty breeds fear. People were scared\u2026they didn\u2019t know what their future was gonna look like. And when this paradigm of the average life changed, so too did philosophy. This whole period is known as the Hellenistic age\u2026Philosophy was shifting from a focus on metaphysics and epistemology to a focus on ethics. Philosophy was changing from something that resembled the works of Plato and Aristotle to something that more resembled the work of Socrates. Remember, Socrates was the guy that didn\u2019t have time for all those pointless abstract questions about what the universe is made of\u2026he was more concerned with finding what the best way to live life was or how to be happy. With all the stress of the political climate of the time, Its no wonder why all of these new schools of philosophy that were cropping up were much more heavily influenced by Socrates than Plato or Aristotle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere were three main schools\u2026 but also a fourth which is worthy of note. These were Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism and later, Cynicism. Much like the four dynasties of the political landscape\u2026these four schools were constantly battling with each other trying to assert their dominance. Throughout this Hellenistic Age series\u2026we\u2019re gonna be talking a lot about the relationships and battles between these schools. And in the end.. when we\u2019re left with the winner, the king of the Hellenistic Age hill, we\u2019ll realize just how important the politics of the day are in determining which Philosophical Schools emerge victorious and which fail. A concept that will be crucial in understanding the next 1500 years or so.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere aren\u2019t many people throughout history that can claim to be as misunderstood as Epicurus. I think most people think of Epicureanism as being synonymous with a life of indulgence, but this actually is very far from the truth. The entire goal of his philosophy was to increase your \u201cAtaraxia\u201d, it was a word at the time that meant tranquility or more specifically a complete freedom from pain. For Epicurus, it was a very literal struggle against pain. Apparently he spent most of his life with chronic severe pain in his stomach and gut and it\u2019s commonly thought that he died of very bad kidney stones. I mean, he writes a letter on his death bed where he tells his friend that he knows he is going to die and that he\u2019s unable to urinate and he is in EXTREME pain. It\u2019s terrible.. But the freedom of pain that he talks about in his philosophy\u2026the freedom of pain that someone could relate to very well in the Hellenistic age, was a completely different kind of pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSeven years after the death of Plato, Epicurus was born\u2026341 BC. Every account seems to agree that he was born and raised by poor parents on a small island in the Mediterranean sea that would have been considered a relatively insignificant colony of Athens at the time\u2026 so it\u2019s important to note that for all of his childhood\u2026all of his formative years\u2026Epicurus lived a\u2026maybe not a constant poverty stricken existence\u2026but definitely a very modest and humbling existence. And much like Siddhartha Gautama\u2026 both spent their malleable years in a place that would offer an invaluable insight into what happiness truly is when developing their philosophy later. Both had access to an extreme end of the spectrum that they could contrast\u2026 their future more realistic lives with, so as not to fall victim to the common delusions about what people think they\u2019re lacking\u2026Palaces and riches for Siddhartha\u2026abject poverty for Epicurus\u2026and when he finally left the island he spent all those years on\u2026it\u2019s interesting to consider that he studied under philosophers who were direct students of two people\u2026Plato and Democritus. When you compare the two as philosophers\u2026they\u2019re not even in the same galaxy\u2026If you compared innovating philosophy to the task of getting off a deserted island\u2026Plato would be Tom Hanks in Cast Away\u2026and Democritus would be his volleyball friend Wilson. Plato did EVERYTHING\u2026and Democritus just kinda\u2026floated there with that creepy smile\u2026\n\nBut for Epicurus, it was the opposite. Democritus was the guy that he really attached himself to\u2026he laid the groundwork for all of his metaphysics. Now, just to recap, Democritus is the guy that believed that everything we see in the world consists of atoms and void. Epicurus agreed with him. They both believed that because things we see are able to move around\u2026they must be moving into empty space right? or else they wouldn\u2019t be able to move. So they call this empty space\u2026Void. They also both believed that the things we see around us are composites\u2026they\u2019re made up of many things smaller than the thing itself\u2026because if they weren\u2019t, then we wouldn\u2019t be able to break them into smaller pieces or cut them down to size. But on that same note, they both don\u2019t think that that process of cutting things in half can go on forever\u2026and there must be some fundamental, unchanging, eternal building block of stuff that can explain the uniformity of the world and everything in it. That building block is the atom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo they love each other. They agree on many things. But obviously not everything\u2026and the differences between the Metaphysics of Epicurus and Democritus, as far as atoms go\u2026 lie in three main areas. The first one is that Epicurus believes atoms have a weight, and naturally move downward. There\u2019s all sorts of multi-generational drama at work here\u2026let me bring you up to speed though\u2026Previously on General Hospital: Democritus said that ALL atomic motion\u2026all movement of atoms throughout the void\u2026is the result of previous atomic collisions\u2026like this atom got his by that atom and they collided and hit that atom that went flying over there\u2026etc\u2026.then years later Aristotle threw Democritus a curve ball and said\u2026well\u2026that\u2019s great and all, cool story but how did they begin moving in the first place? Then Epicurus responds to Aristotle by saying that atoms have a weight, and therefore\u2026in this pre-sir Isaac Newton world they are living in\u2026atoms naturally would travel downward\u2026so this explains why they started moving at the beginning of time.\n\nBut then you gotta be thinking\u2026and I\u2019m sure Aristotle WOULD have been thinking\u2026well why didn\u2019t the atoms just move perfectly downward and never collide into each other? How do you explain them running into each other in the first place? Well the answer to this is the second of three differences between epicurean metaphysics and Democritean metaphysics\u2026The swerve.\n\nSimply put, the swerve is Epicurus\u2019s way of explaining how atoms originally collided with each other\u2026 and its just that every so often\u2026at random times\u2026in random intervals\u2026an atom will kind of \u201cswerve\u201d to the side a bit\u2026..That\u2019s it. Now everyone tries to compare this to modern quantum physics and how there is some infinitely small percentage chance of an atom shifting position on its own\u2026I think it\u2019s safe to say Epicurus didn\u2019t stumble across this in 300 BC\u2026but that\u2019s not to say there is nothing profound about this idea. The implications behind the swerve theory fueled a philosophical debate that still exists to this day.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean\u2026Democritus believed in a sort of cosmic determinism\u2026he thought that based on his theory of the universe\u2026pick an atom\u2026if you followed that atom\u2026right now somewhere in the universe\u2026and it is moving\u2026eventually that atom is going to run into another atom and combine with it and maybe those two atoms will run into a rock or something\u2026\u2026the universe is so constant and predictable that you could\u2019ve known the future of that atom\u2026you could\u2019ve known it was going to combine with the rock\u2026and for that matter\u2026you could know EVERYTHING that was EVER going to happen to that atom if you were willing to do the calculations far enough out. Humans, like rocks and planets are ALSO made up of just atoms\u2026so everything, including human action, to Democritus were just atoms colliding and moving around in space\u2026and in that sense that everything was already pre-determined.\n\nBut Epicurus didn\u2019t agree\u2026he agreed that our bodies are made up of the same atoms that celestial bodies are made up of\u2026but if this determinism was true, we would all be hopeless spectators to our bodies and their actions\u2026passengers not in control\u2026. You know\u2026you\u2019d just be hopelessly watching your atoms go to the bathroom and forget to put the toilet seat down\u2026MILLIONS OF MEN AROUND THE WORLD WOULD HAVE AN EXCUSE\u2026and you can\u2019t really be held accountable. And not just that\u2026 this would make morality absolutely pointless because you could never hold anyone accountable for any of their actions\u2026it was just an unfortunate sequence and collision of atoms\u2026he agreed with most of what Democritus said\u2026but he held that there must be at least some small amount of free will at work here\u2026and that\u2019s how he rationalizes the \u201cswerve\u201d doctrine\u2026\n\nA Roman Poet and staunch Epicurean named Lucretius puts it well in his poem De Rerum Natura\n\n\u201cAgain, if all movement is always interconnected, the new arising from the old in a determinate order \u2013 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate, the everlasting sequence of cause and effect \u2013 what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe third difference between their theories of atoms involves his thought that the causes of our sensations come from something outside of the sensations themselves, but I think it will make the most sense and be the most memorable if we cover it in a future episode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet me just say\u2026the first half of his philosophy is natural philosophy\u2026or what in modern times we would probably just call science\u2026and even though he got a lot of things wrong\u2026he didn\u2019t do too badly\u2026considering\u2026but make no mistake his aim was to find a rational way of understanding the world that had nothing to do with gods or supernatural forces\u2026this was extremely important to him\u2026and if he didn\u2019t have one, ALL THE REST of his philosophy becomes much less effective. Throughout the years epicureans railed against any sort of magical or supernatural or fate driven account for some phenomena happening. Sometimes they got a little carried away. Just how you can stagnate scientific progress by blindly accepting that a supernatural force is behind something you don\u2019t understand\u2026You can also stagnate scientific progress by prematurely accepting a rational account for why something happened without any evidence\u2026simply because you want SOME explanation that\u2019s not supernatural. The epicureans were definitely guilty of this.\n\nJust to make this clear\u2026The two halves of Epicurus\u2019s philosophy fit together beautifully, but in order for the second half to work properly, Epicurus thought you NEEDED this rational explanation of the world without gods. So he naturally approached it more comprehensively than just making a few updates to Democritus and his theory of atoms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was an empiricist. On one hand he had to refute the rationalist descendants of Plato\u2026and on the other he had to refute one of the major rival philosophical schools of the time\u2026the skeptics. In other words, not only did he have to make a case for why information gathered through the senses is the BEST way to arrive at truth, but he also had to make a case that TRUTH was something that could be obtained at all. Not exactly an easy task\u2026but he came up with some pretty interesting ideas.\n\nHe believed that we COULD arrive at the truth, but in order for us to get there\u2026we needed three things: sensations, preconceptions and feelings. He thought when we see any object\u2026that object is constantly sending off a layer of atoms\u2026one atom thick\u2026think ripples in a pond\u2026except the ripples are atoms and they are moving in every possible direction\u2026and those atoms\u2026SLAM up against our eyes or into our body\u2026and our sense organs READ this layer of atoms and create a picture in our minds of what the world around us is. But he made it VERY clear that we need to proceed with caution. He heard the arguments from people\u2026He heard when they said that the senses lie to us and are crude, biological instruments that deceive us all the time\u2026why should we trust them? Well, Epicurus thought that it wasn\u2019t the SENSES that were deceiving us\u2026our MINDS were deceiving us. And this is where the preconceptions and feelings come into play\u2026the way Epicurus saw it\u2026how can we blame the sense organs? The eyes or ears or nose are just transmitting information\u2026it is purely mechanical\u2026the EYES aren\u2019t making judgments that the world IS a certain way or ISNT a certain way. That\u2019s YOU doing that. That\u2019s your mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, he recognized that the senses weren\u2019t perfect\u2026he just thought it was dumb to go against EVERYTHING the senses tell us\u2026because if you went extreme and discounted EVERYTHING the senses told you\u2026you would have no reference point to relate other information to\u2026He says it in number 23 of his principal doctrines:\n\n\u201cIf you fight against all your sensations, you will have no standard to which to refer, and thus no means of judging even those sensations which you claim are false.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe gives a great example about seeing a tower in the distance\u2026If you were half a mile away from that tower and it looked round\u2026you would assume based on that input that the tower was round in shape\u2026but then if you walked towards the tower and it slowly started to change\u2026and eventually when you were only a couple hundred yards away the tower looked square\u2026at which point were your senses lying to you? Well, he gives us an atomic explanation for distortions between your senses and the waves of atoms coming off of an object and gives us a general rule of thumb that the CLOSER you are to something the more accurate of a representation you are getting\u2026but that\u2019s probably delving too far into it\u2026the important rung on the ladder of epistemology is that\u2026yeah\u2026the senses are far from perfect\u2026but he thought they\u2019re the best and most reliable thing we have\u2026so really what you should do is realize the faults and limitations of them and the things they are good at. No matter what the senses tell us there is at least SOME basis in reality\u2026they\u2019re never COMPLETELY lying to us.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd THIS is the nexus of epicurean philosophy. This is the JUNCTION STATION of the two halves of his philosophy that we were talking about earlier\u2026we perceive the world in a flawed way because of our mind\u2026our mind\u2019s flawed way of interpreting what the senses tell us. In the same exact way, we perceive our happiness in a flawed way because of our mind\u2026our mind\u2019s flawed way of interpreting the situations we live in. It\u2019s not the input\u2026it\u2019s the mind\u2019s interpretation of that input. and if you ask me\u2026THIS is what Epicurus should truly be remembered for. I mean\u2026people have this misconception that Epicurus was a guy that preached constant indulgence and vice\u2026these people have this idea that the guy was walking around telling everyone to drink a thermos full of clam chowder everyday\u2026become 900 pounds\u2026come on\u2026really? It couldn\u2019t be further from the truth\u2026but in a way he suffered the same fate of rampant gossip that Pythagoras did years earlier\u2026because after Epicurus studied under and wasn\u2019t really happy with the way he was teaching\u2026he set up his own philosophical schools in and then in before finally settling back down in Athens at the age of 34 where He bought a house on the outskirts of Athens and started the school he would become famous for\u2026the Garden.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow the Garden was very special\u2026it accepted women and slaves as members and advocated a very communal simple life\u2026a collection of friends all reveling in the production of Epicurus\u2019s teachings\u2026leaving behind all the politics and ambitions that come with being a citizen living in the busy city that lead to nothing but disappointment or dissatisfaction. The only problem was\u2026it was precisely that\u2026a commune. The secretive cult-like atmosphere where they secluded themselves from the population\u2026 led to tons of gossip and over-simplifications of what Epicurus taught. It was kind of a perfect storm of several things all coming together. People love to draw comparisons between Epicureanism and Hedonism\u2026they love to attach the two. Hedonism is a school of thought where pleasure is seen as the only intrinsic good and not only was it not CREATED by Epicurus\u2026it would have been well known by the time of Epicurus\u2026I mean Hedonism goes all the way back to even Ancient Sumeria in the Epic of Gilgamesh. You know\u2026it says \u201cFill your belly. Day and night make merry. Let days be full of joy. Dance and make music day and night. These things alone are the concern of men.\u201d The problem is that the definition of pleasure varies between all of the hedonist philosophers, so it is unfair to classify Epicurus with people like the Cyrenaics and think of them all as the same. But years later, the hedonism of Roman times\u2026when they were conquering and looting the world, would have been associated with Epicureanism. But he wasn\u2019t an advocate of just ANY pleasure, or anything anyone could possibly perceive to be pleasure.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thought it was OBVIOUS that PLEASURE is the goal of life\u2026i mean we all start from birth with the knowledge that pleasure is a positive experience and pain is one we should avoid, but the important distinction he makes is that there are two kinds of pleasure. Kinetic pleasure and Static Pleasure. Kinetic pleasure is also known as \u201cMoving\u201d pleasure\u2026and it\u2019s what most people think of when they think of pleasure\u2026an example of kinetic pleasure would be like eating a half gallon of ice cream when you\u2019re hungry\u2026you experience kinetic pleasure when you are actively in the process of satisfying a desire\u2026like hunger in this case. Your senses are stimulated in a pleasurable way\u2026most people see this as pleasure.\n\nBut once you\u2019ve actually ladled the half-gallon of Rocky Road into your stomach\u2026 you aren\u2019t hungry anymore\u2026once your desire has been fulfilled\u2026 a certain state of being overcomes you. You are satisfied. You are no longer DESIRING that thing anymore. Epicurus says that this state of tranquility is also a type of pleasure\u2026a static pleasure\u2026and whether we realize it or not, it is the BEST kind of pleasure and the kind we should strive for. So in other words, pleasure in its purest form is just the absence of pain\u2026and when we desire something, we see ourselves as lacking in some way\u2026which also counts as a form of pain. As humans were constantly thrown back and forth on a crazy ride between these two states. In number 8 of his principle doctrines he says:\n\n\u201cNo pleasure is a bad thing in itself, but the things which produce certain pleasures entail disturbances many times greater than the pleasures themselves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn this same note, he thought a lot of people wrongly believe that once they\u2019ve reached this tranquility\u2026this static pleasure\u2026that by treating themselves to a kinetic pleasure\u2026 THAT will increase their level of happiness. For example\u2026lets say it\u2019s really cold outside\u2026and you want a jacket. You desire warmth. What Epicurus is saying is that once that warmth is satisfied\u2026lets say with a 20 dollar jacket from Target\u2026there\u2019s not much difference in pleasure between that 20 dollar jacket from Target and a $3000 jacket from Nordstrom. There\u2019s a point of diminishing returns, and for Epicurus it is that point of static pleasure\u2026the absence of pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with the jacket example\u2026if you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s not true\u2026just think of how ridiculous it would seem if you tried to increase your pleasure with a kinetic pleasure while you were in pain. Imagine if you were riding your bike\u2026and a car hits you and breaks your leg in six places. You\u2019re just lying on the ground writhing in pain\u2026screaming for help. And then the ambulance comes\u2026the EMT comes up to you on the ground\u2026looks at your leg and says \u201cI know what you need\u2026here\u2019s a nice vanilla ice cream come little guy there you go!\u201d and pats you on the head\u2026\u2026..NO! that\u2019s not what I need\u2026I want to go to the hospital! I want this pain to go away\u2026In the same way the kinetic pleasure is USELESS when it comes to actually increasing your level of pleasure in THAT context\u2026Epicurus thinks it is equally as useless at actually increasing your pleasure when nothing is wrong. He expands on which desires are good and bad in number 26 of his principle doctrines:\n\n\u201cAll desires that do not lead to pain when they remain unsatisfied are unnecessary, but the desire is easily got rid of when the thing desired is difficult to obtain or the desires seem likely to produce harm.\u201d\n\nSo, pleasure is really about removing things that cause pain. And we have to be careful about choosing what we THINK will bring us pleasure that might in the long run bring us pain. And besides\u2026all these physical pleasures and pains are secondary anyway. The really important part is achieving a state of MENTAL static pleasure\u2026or mental tranquility. It is the more powerful, more useful and ultimate form of pleasure. The goal of life. Now when we have the broken leg\u2026its very obvious to us which pain needs to go away\u2026but how do we figure out what is preventing us from MENTAL tranquility?\n\nEpicurus thought that people live in a constant state of irrational fear, anxiety and superstition. The biggest causes of these fears are the fear of death or the fear of being trapped in some really terrible afterlife for all of eternity\u2026a fear of the gods. But Epicurus wasn\u2019t too worried about the gods\u2026as far as he saw it\u2026for some reason everyone thinks of these gods as existing in some blissful\u2026tranquil state of being\u2026but also believes that they are perpetually concerning themselves with all the troubles and woes of humans living on planet earth. He thought that the gods must exist, but they just\u2026don\u2019t want anything to do with humans\u2026too much trouble. And it certainly explains why they\u2019re working so hard to conceal themselves from everyone all the time. We should view the lore surrounding them as a lifestyle to emulate\u2026not as something to fear after death. So great\u2026we don\u2019t have to fear the gods anymore\u2026that\u2019s a weight lifted off of our shoulders. But what about death? Certainly were justified in being anxious and scared about death right?\n\nWell\u2026no. And this is why understanding his metaphysics and epistemology is so important, because having that knowledge, the rational explanation for the mechanics of the world works so well with his ethics and his view on \u201cwhat is the best way to live life?\u201d According to principle doctrine number two of Epicurus:\n\n\u201cDeath is nothing to us; for that which has been dissolved into its elements experiences no sensations, and that which has no sensation is nothing to us.\u201d\n\nDeath is nothing to us. Human beings consist of only atoms. The human mind or soul is just another component of a human, and must also consist only of atoms. So therefore\u2026when you die\u2026the atoms that make up your mind\u2026just like the ones that make up your body\u2026will disperse and all go their separate ways\u2026and you have no sense organs\u2026so you are incapable of sensing anything. See\u2026 people got it all wrong\u2026.the STATE of death isn\u2019t unpleasant\u2026maybe the PROCESS of dying will be\u2026but once were dead\u2026 we don\u2019t exist anymore\u2026Death is nothing to us\u2026the Roman poet Lucretious would later say:\n\n\u201cthe mind must be made of matter and suffer same fate as the body\u201d\n\nEpicurus says in his principle doctrine number 10 that:\n\n\u201cIf the things that produce the pleasures of profligate men really freed them from fears of the mind concerning celestial and atmospheric phenomena, the fear of death, and the fear of pain; if, further, they taught them to limit their desires, we should never have any fault to find with such persons, for they would then be filled with pleasures from every source and would never have pain of body or mind, which is what is bad.\u201d\n\nRemember, the goal of life is pleasure\u2026but the only way you can achieve true pleasure, atoraxia\u2026 is by first understanding the nature of things\u2026the rational explanation for the physical structure of the universe. Then once you realize that you\u2019re just atoms and void like everything else\u2026and you\u2019re not going through some\u2026 obstacle course constantly trying to earn your spot into Andy\u2019s toy Box in the sky\u2026you know\u2026like in toy story\u2026because the gods have new toys to play with, alive on planet earth\u2026and you\u2019re just a relic of the past in a constant state of limbo\u2026I thought it was clev"}, "episode_7": {"date": "2014-4-29", "text": "Posted on April 29, 2014\nEpisode 11 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 11 on Stoicism and the Early Cynics.\n\nStoicism is typically broken down into 3 parts Logic, Physics and Ethics\u2026The chronology of its initial development in the Hellenistic age is also typically broken down into 3 parts\u2026the early stoa\u2026middle stoa and late stoa. Each phase of its development made notable breakthroughs in different areas\u2026.but its important to note a few things. By far, the most popular and most notable thinkers of the Stoic school are three people\u2026Epictetus\u2026Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t live during the early or middle stoa periods\u2026.all three of them made their contributions during the \u201clate\u201d stoa\u2026and they didn\u2019t drastically change Logic or Physics\u2026all three of them made their greatest contributions in the field of ethics. To talk about the ideas of these three men alone would be a very pigeonholed view of Stoicism, but on the other hand, doing an entire episode on each one of them would be filled with redundancy because two-thirds of their entire philosophy is almost exactly the same as the other two guys. Because of this, next episode will be almost solely dedicated to understanding Stoic Ethics and the great ideas the three of them laid out. In the mean time, it is impossible to understand where they are coming from in their ethics without first understanding the other 2 parts\u2026Logic and Physics. The Stoics saw Logic Physics and Ethics as completely interrelated and dependent on each other. They compared it to an egg, with the three representing the shell, the egg white and the egg yolk, all three combined serving a more complete purpose than any one in isolation. The things stoicism is most known for are stoic ethics and stoicism as a bridge to a western world dominated by Christianity. Think of today\u2019s episode as a first encounter with Stoicism, a coat of primer, and an explanation of the VERY important groundwork of the founding of stoicism, how it evolved from cynicism\u2026and once it matured and reached the end of the early stoa\u2026how its well defined and well tested ideas acted as a springboard for the great Stoic ethics that were to come and made it possible for Stoicism to ascend above the ashes of its rival philosophical schools and become the dominant philosophy of Rome.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s something else I have to say, and the closer we get to modern times the less I\u2019m going to have to say this\u2026but the exact sourcing of a lot of the ideas that came during the period of the early stoa are a little shaky. The IDEAS definitely were there, we can definitely attach these ideas to the period, the problem is assigning a particular idea to a particular philosopher. Three big Stoic philosophers make up the early stoa: Zeno, Cleanthes and Chrisyppus. We don\u2019t have a single COMPLETE work of any of these guys\u2026just fragments. And the sourcing we DO have on them come from either non-philosophers or later hostile Christian writers. In a perfect world, we would have their complete works, but the three of them combined make up a pretty solid picture of what the founding principles of stoicism really were.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen some depiction of a post-apocalyptic world in this giant media landscape we\u2019re immersed in\u2026and we\u2019ve all heard those really tough guys that stack encyclopedias on the bill of their hats so that they\u2019re super flat\u2026we\u2019ve all heard them talk about how THEY would be the ones to THRIVE if some huge disaster happened. But the fact of the matter is that\u2026you cant know that. You never know how you\u2019re going to respond to pandemonium until you\u2019re surrounded by it. Some people DO thrive\u2026some people curl up into the fetal position. The same thing can be said for chaos and adversity that isn\u2019t as immediate, like the kind that the people of the Hellenistic age found themselves in politically. My dad, for the very short time I knew him always said that if he ever found himself in some zombie apocalypse\u2026or volcanic eruption\u2026that he\u2019d just grab a lawn chair\u2026sit up on his roof with his friends, crack open a beer and watch it all go down, watch everyone scramble. Well, when you put it that way it sounds like an incredibly white trash thing to do, but if everyone finds their own way to cope with the zombie apocalypse, removing yourself from all the stress of the rat race that probably, when it all comes down to it, is gonna be completely futile anyway\u2026and just hanging out with your friends trying to relax and enjoy the spectacle of it all, it really doesn\u2019t sound too bad. In fact, it sounds a little like the Epicurean approach to the \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d of the Hellenistic age\u2026remember you would live in a commune with your closest friends\u2026away from the busy city\u2026not concerning yourself with things like amassing wealth or changing the world, all that stuff wasn\u2019t gonna matter much anyway\u2026you should just relax and pursue real pleasure. Well if the Epicureans were the people sitting up on their roof, then the Stoics would be the survivors, if there were any. They wouldn\u2019t be the people running around flailing their arms in a panic\u2026they would recognize that their situation wasn\u2019t looking good, but wouldn\u2019t be emotionally effected because they\u2019ve accepted their fate, whatever it is and realize that even if it doesn\u2019t seem good on the surface, it ultimately is for the best. They wouldn\u2019t be the people with no plan\u2026the people just following orders\u2026one member of a mass exodus of people all heading towards a military base\u2026they would use their natural ability to reason to make the wisest and most virtuous decision, because at least that decision would be in harmony with nature.\n\nSee, because when it comes down to it, a lot of people talk about Epicureans and Stoics not just as rival philosophical schools of their time, but they even go so far as to say they are Two different kinds of people. I don\u2019t know if I entirely agree with the idea that they can be seen as opposites, after all they were both schools, both descendant of Socrates, interested in the practical philosophy of the \u201cgood\u201d life and there actually are some huge similarities. But at the same time I understand where these people are coming from, There was an article published in 1869 that talks about the two different kinds of people and their common personality traits:\n\n\u201cThere have ever been stern, upright, self-controlled, and courageous men, actuated by a pure sense of duty, capable of high efforts of self-sacrifice, somewhat intolerant of the frailties of others, somewhat hard and unsympathizing in the ordinary intercourse of society, but rising to heroic grandeur as the storm lowered upon their path, and more ready to relinquish life than the cause they believed to be true. There have also always been men of easy tempers and of amiable disposition, gentle, benevolent, and pliant, cordial friends and forgiving enemies, selfish at heart, yet ever ready, when it is possible, to unite their gratifications with those of others, averse to all enthusiasm, mysticism, utopias, and superstition, with little depth of character or capacity for self-sacrifice, but admirably fitted to impart and to receive enjoyment, and to render the course of life easy and harmonious. The first are by nature Stoics, and the second Epicureans.\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019m reading that, I\u2019m almost reading it like it\u2019s a horoscope\u2026I\u2019m just trying to find little bits of it that I relate to so I can say\u2026\u201dthat\u2019s me, that\u2019s the type of person I AM!\u201d There were similarities and differences, like most things you can compare. Both schools offered a way to cultivate a tranquil state of mind, but they laid out completely different ways to get there\u2026Epicureanism was about living a simple, self-governed life aimed at feeling pleasure\u2026but stoicism was more of a challenge people put themselves through\u2026an obstacle course. Both schools agreed that we dont really need much more than our basic needs satisfied to acheive a state of true happiness\u2026 or ataraxia\u2026the difference lied in where to focus your efforts ONCE those basic needs were met\u2026epicureans thought you should dedicate your time to attaining pleasure\u2026the stoics thought you should dedicate your time to living more virtuously. Both schools thought you shouldn\u2019t go throughout your life scared about what might happen to you\u2026or scared of death or the gods or whatever\u2026there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Epicureans said you had nothing to worry about because you\u2019re just a collection of atoms anyway\u2026a collection that was randomly thrown together and eventually will break down and go on to form something else, so there is no afterlife to fear. The Stoics thought you had nothing to fear because you didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of control over it anyway. They preached the idea of resigned acceptance. The universe has been created and destroyed a seemingly infinite number of times and things pan out in the same way\u2026the absolute perfect way each and every time. You have a fate, whatever it is\u2026 and its pointless to be worried about it.\n\nTo find the origins of stoicism, you have to start with a story of a guy named Zeno and a guy named Diogenes. Both of which are names we\u2019ve mentioned on the podcast before, and both of which are not the same people. This is actually the THIRD Diogenes we\u2019ve mentioned. I\u2019ve always said it, if I could go back in time I would just go back to this general period of Greco-Roman dominance and just become a psychic. I mean how easy would it be? You just go up to everyone and say \u201cI see a Diogenes in your life\u201d! Oh my god I have 12 of them! This guys amazing! Anyway, the founder of stoicism is a guy named Zeno, more commonly referred to in history books as Zeno of Citium. Actually, let me just start here. Have you guys ever heard of a stoa? Well of course you have I talked about it last episode. Plato set up his Academy to the west of Athens\u2026Aristotle set up his Lyceum to the East of Athens\u2026Diogenes was to the south of Athens\u2026and Zeno \u2026you guessed it\u2026right in the center. But hey! he was on the northern side of the Athenian agora\u2026he taught in a place known as the Stoa Poikile or the \u201cPainted Stoa\u201d. See, if you were walking around the agora at the time and walked into the stoa, you would\u2019ve walked into a place with a crazy energy all around you\u2026there was a lot of history in this stoa. years before Zeno\u2026right after the Pelopenesian war when the thirty tyrants were in charge of Athens, 1400 people were sentenced to death in that stoa. On the the back wall of the stoa you would\u2019ve seen tons of beautiful paintings\u2026of gods\u2026or Greek military conquests\u2026one by Polignotus showcasing the great victory of Marathon over the Persians\u2026and right in the middle of all of this you would\u2019ve seen a tan-skinned, tall, thin man walking back and forth, gesturing with his arms, lecturing a group of people standing or sitting around him. And this man would\u2019ve been known as Zeno, the founder of stoicism. In fact, their pastime of holding lectures in this painted stoa is how they got their name. The Stoics\u2026that and their original name of Zenonians just didn\u2019t have a good ring to it. I mean, would you rather be a Zenonian or a Stoic.\n\nZeno was born in 334 BC\u2026thirteen years after the death of Plato\u2026and early in life Zeno went to an oracle \u2026the oracle of the Greek god Apollo\u2026.and asked the oracle how do I get the best life possible? The oracle says back to him\u2026\u201dYou should take on the complexion of the dead\u201d Well I didn\u2019t get it at first\u2026so I looked up the word complexion\u2026and Merriam Webster has two definitions\u2026the first one is the color or appearance of the skin\u2026especially on the face\u2026now call me crazy\u2026but I don\u2019t think the oracle was giving him beauty secrets\u2026telling him to make his face look more dead\u2026so the second definition is the general appearance or character of something. Now, That makes little more sense.\n\nI mean, why would it benefit a live person, to take on the general character of a dead person? In what area does a living person envy a dead person? He thought about it for a while\u2026then he decided to read a bunch of ancient books, ancient in 300 BC so that\u2019s saying something\u2026 and then the next truly conclusive page that we have out of his diary is that in around 311 BC Zeno just survives a terrible shipwreck\u2026 and swims up onto shore and goes to Athens\u2026 Now\u2026why did he just suddenly decide that his life of being a merchant was over and going to Athens and studying philosophy was a good idea\u2026 right then. Surviving a shipwreck in 300 BC\u2026 the odds must have been like Normandy beach. I mean it had to have been intense\u2026there\u2019s no helicopter rescue\u2026there\u2019s no life jackets\u2026 not only would it have been terrifying and probably something you\u2019ve never experienced or even SEEN before\u2026 but it also would have been an extreme test of physical endurance if you wanted to live. Zeno almost DIED in that shipwreck, he was clinging to life\u2026just Michael Phelpsing it to shore\u2026 and now\u2026 of all times\u2026THIS is the time you choose to make a complete career change into answering questions about the nature of existence? He\u2019d found the complexion of the dead alright\u2026no doubt he probably thought he\u2019d gotten a little too close to the general character of the dead. After a close call like that, Zeno was ready to go skydiving\u2026rocky mountain climbin\u2019\u2026 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu! This near death experience CHANGED his outlook on life. And quick aside, if you want to take something from Zeno\u2019s life\u2026go get in a shipwreck. The sentiment of what I\u2019m about to say has been hijacked and squandered by cliches for the last I don\u2019t know how many years, but it\u2019s worth saying. You want to dramatically improve your life? Find a way to actually think of each day and each moment as a gift. Fabricate the feeling state you gain from a near death experience without actually having one and you\u2019ll live a thousand lifetimes.\n\nSo Zeno survives the shipwreck\u2026shows up in Athens\u2026and sits down at a bookstore. He starts reading a book by Xenophon, you might remember that name from our episode on Socrates\u2026he was one of the only four sources historians have that talk about Socrates in any depth\u2026and Zeno\u2026was reading his book about Socrates\u2026way back then. He instantly loved the guy\u2026 so much so that he went up to the bookstore owner and asked him where in the world he could find a man like Socrates, he wanted to learn from him. So the shopkeeper just looks outside of the shop\u2026and like a scene out of a movie\u2026 he points to a scraggly man walking past the shop and says \u201cThere\u201d. The man was Crates\u2026Cynic philosopher\u2026 staunch admirer of Socrates\u2026and all around a well-liked guy for his time. For Zeno, the decision was easy. He would become his student and learn the philosophy of Cynicism.\n\nNow, as we\u2019ve said before Stoicism and Epicureanism were heavily influenced by Socrates and his piratical approach to philosophy\u2026 Cynicism was another embodiment of the Socratic lifestyle. In fact, the first Cynic was a guy named Antisthenes who was actually a STUDENT of Socrates\u2026and there were other Cynics that achieved immense popularity like Crates\u2026 but no Cynic is more memorable or more\u2026devoted to the cause\u2026than Diogenes of Sinope. To somebody that didn\u2019t know what Cynicism was, this guy would look ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. Imagine Charles Manson living in a tub on the streets. Diogenes lived in a tub. He\u2019d yell out at people who were just minding their own business in the marketplace\u2026he would heckle Plato at his lectures and try to ruin them\u2026 some stories tell about him carrying around a lantern in the daytime\u2026 the original Greek word that was later Latinized into cynic meant \u201cdog-like\u201d. Really, it was just referring to an extreme animalistic rejection to human conventions\u2026 but Diogenes took it literally. he would bark at people\u2026he would lay around in public completely nude\u2026 he would do other activities in public that are not appropriate for a family show like this one\u2026 there\u2019s a story of people messing with him and when they were eating at a banquet they threw him their bones as though he were a dog\u2026 so he does the natural thing\u2026he runs up and starts peeing on them\u2026like he\u2019s a dog. He was so well known as a philosopher and social miscreant that Alexander the Great wanted to meet him\u2026and Alexander walks up to him laying on the ground and introduces himself and asks him \u201cis there anything I can do for you\u201d and Diogenes goes \u201cyeah, move to the left a little\u2026you\u2019re blocking my sunlight\u201d Then after that Alexander says \u201cIf I were not Alexander, then I would want to be Diogenes\u201d and then Diogenes says \u201cIf I were not Diogenes I would also want to be Diogenes\u201d. Now when I hear this story, my first reaction is \u201cDiogenes\u2026what a character\u201d and then my second reaction is \u201cWhy did Alexander the great say he would want to be Diogenes?\u201d and I think I understand now\u2026Alexander the Great was the most powerful man in the world, constantly surrounded by guards\u2026anything he wants he gets\u2026even entire empires\u2026there\u2019s nothing any normal man can do to him. In a strange way, Diogenes is the same. He\u2019s so devoid of any pride, possessions, relationships\u2026there\u2019s a freedom in having nothing to lose\u2026 and I think this is what Alexander was getting at. But it\u2019s not like Diogenes was doing all this stuff simply for the sake of being strange\u2026his lifestyle was a representation, albeit a very extreme one, of Cynic philosophy. Cynicism was also about achieving a tranquil state of mind, the difference it and something like Epicureanism\u2026 was the method of getting there. This tranquility can also be thought of as self-sufficiency, because you are completely unaffected by things like\u2026unfair rules or unrealistic desires\u2026external restrictions. Cynics believed that the \u201cgood\u201d life\u2026or the life that is worth living is a virtuous life, and a virtuous life is one that is in agreement with nature. But they aren\u2019t talking about\u2026recycling or not dumping toxic waste into the ocean, at least not exclusively\u2026they\u2019re talking about being in harmony with our own human nature and our place within nature. Part of our human nature is having the ability to use reason to better understand our nature. and if you were to live in perfect harmony with nature, there wouldn\u2019t be any external restrictions\u2026 you would be\u2026 self-sufficient\u2026 Happiness is living in accordance with our rational understanding of nature. Now what Diogenes says is that Human nature isn\u2019t to be part of this society with all it\u2019s little conventions and restrictions and rituals. All these desires, the desire to be a movie star\u2026or to have a giant vault of money\u2026 or to be President of the United States\u2026 all of these desires are things that society has IMPLANTED in us! Diogenes just took this to an extreme and said that we shouldn\u2019t care about whether we live in a tub or not\u2026or whether we look like Charles Manson carrying around a lantern at high noon\u2026we should live a life in accordance with nature and do whatever we want to do\u2026 whenever we want to do it. The more we do that, the closer we will get to achieving this tranquil state of mind.\n\nThere\u2019s a famous story about Zeno where he is a student of Crates\u2026learning the ropes of Cynic thought\u2026and apparently he was a really good student when it came to learning the philosophy\u2026but Crates thought he was way too modest\u2026I mean, to be a true Cynic you needed to give up any semblance of pride imaginable. you needed to be able to have the mindset where if something mortifying happened to you or you were forced to sleep in the gutter\u2026none of this would matter to you because you reject the idea of social conventions. So to teach him a lesson, Crates gives Zeno an assignment\u2026he forces him to carry around a pot of lentil-soup everywhere he goes.\n\nZeno, embarrassed of having to walk around with a pot of soup, tries to hide the pot underneath his robe so that no one will see\u2026.and Crates\u2026with a move that in retrospect was completely uncalled for\u2026takes his staff and smashes the pot, so now Zeno is REALLY embarrassed\u2026lentil soup running down his legs looking quite similar to diarrhea. Zeno\u2019s humiliated\u2026he runs off to hide and to clean himself off and Crates yells after him, \u201cWhy run away, my little Phoenician?\u201d, \u201cnothing terrible has befallen you. It\u2019s these sorts of traumatic situations that probably led to Zeno not being entirely on board with the Cynics\u2026he liked a lot of what they had to say but he wasn\u2019t totally satisfied\u2026if he was\u2026he would\u2019ve just become a cynic. Cynicism was an evolution of Socrates\u2026and stoicism was an evolution of cynicism.\n\nSo these cynics like crates and Diogenes were around for a long time\u2026kind of echoes of Daoism in there\u2026.you know the idea that a lot of society that most people see as progress is actually regression and we should return back to our more natural state. It\u2019s clear that Zeno and Stoicism for that matter\u2026was heavily impacted by two main ideas from Cynicism. One is the idea that the only thing you need to live a good life\u2026a happy life\u2026is virtue. The other is the notion that the best way to live life can be found by looking to nature.\n\nBut Zeno thought something was missing\u2026. one of the main things that is missing from cynicism\u2026 that\u2019s a key element in stoicism is the idea of physics and metaphysics\u2026 an explanation of the universe. Where is it? The Cynics were direct descendants of Socrates\u2026 it\u2019s understandable for them to think that these questions were too abstract to be productive. But for the Stoics and Zeno it just wasn\u2019t good enough. Remember? A big part of his method of achieving a state of tranquility is the idea of fate. When you believe in fate, you realize that worrying about all these things you can\u2019t control is pointless. But in order to PROVE that fate exists, you NEED to ask all these abstract questions. There needs to be some scientific explanation for WHY you shouldn\u2019t be worried. It\u2019s similar to the way the Epicureans NEEDED the explanation that you\u2019re just made of atoms and void to justify their belief that there isn\u2019t some afterlife you should be scared of\u2026you\u2019re just gonna dissolve one day. So Zeno didn\u2019t see it like the Cynics\u2026he didn\u2019t see it as pointless speculation\u2026it may be speculation, but it definitely has a place even in practical philosophy.\n\nSo he left Crates. He decided to try to get a different perspective on everything\u2026maybe try to further his education about how the universe was formed. Some people say he studied at Plato\u2019s academy\u2026obviously after Plato had been dead for a while\u2026some people say he just studied the curriculum of the academy under a guy named Xenocrates. either way, he was obviously influenced by the ideas of the academy in many ways. And ultimately, he combined elements of both his time with the Cynics and his education from the academy to make the most successful school of thought in the Hellenistic age.\n\nThe idea that something bad may happen to you, and even though initially it looks like there is nothing good that can possibly come from it\u2026when its all said and done EVERYTHING happens for the best. This idea was a key element Plato laid out in his work \u201cThe Timaeus\u201d and it seems obvious that in his education Zeno was heavily influenced by this. But there were a lot of differences between Plato\u2019s universe and Zeno\u2019s.\n\nZeno, like Epicurus and unlike Plato\u2026had a materialist view of the universe. He believed that the only things that existed were material bodies. There is no immortal soul or afterlife or transcendent world of forms\u2026all that exists is right in front of our eyes. Nature and the entire universe for that matter\u2026 should be thought of as an all encompassing whole, all animated and governed by a divine logos, which can also be thought of as god\u2019s will, reason, providence, fate and other things\u2026.all wrapped up into one\u2026and humans should be thought of as parts of that whole, our reason\u2026all fractions\u2026or sparks of that divine logos. The important thing to take from that is that everything happens the way it is supposed to and according to a plan governed by this divine logos.\n\nStoic physics really begin with Plato and the teachings of the academy that Zeno no doubt was privy to\u2026There\u2019s a scene in a book called Sophist written by Plato where he\u2019s asking some people\u2026 what is real? how do we know something is real? and one answer someone gives is that something is real\u2026 if it has the capacity to act or be acted upon. Stoicism likes this definition, but they add that only bodies can act or be acted upon\u2026thus only bodies exist. However, they make it very clear they recognize the fact that it is possible to be part of nature without actually existing\u2026non material things like love or justice or time these things are imaginary. Called them figments of the mind.\n\nThe key to achieving a state of mental tranquility is virtue. The key to virtue, is living a life that is in agreement with Nature, hence the well known stoic maxim that \u201cVirtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature.\u201d Alright, so what is nature? Words don\u2019t mean the same things today that they did back then\u2026just like we talked about with the Cynics\u2026being in agreement with nature does not mean to go to Yellowstone national park and pick up trash. Nature is god. The Stoics were a Pantheistic philosophy, Pantheistic means that God IS the universe. Now, as you can see the definition of God is not how people typically think of god in modern times. God isn\u2019t a Homo Sapien up in the sky controlling things, God is the universe which is a material substance that has the ability to reason and uses that reason to structure and control matter to fit its plan.\n\nChrysippus talks about the Stoic view of God here:\n\nThe universe itself is god and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world\u2019s guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStoics believed that God or nature is inside of everything and effects the outcome of everything even down to the smallest detail. To avoid future confusion i\u2019m just going to refer to it as nature from now on. This nature is then further bisected into two types, active and passive. When you\u2019re making anything\u2026 whether its a chair\u2026 or an iPhone\u2026 or a universe\u2026you need materials to make the thing out of\u2026 and then you need someone to assemble it. The passive element of nature is the raw materials\u2026 the matter\u2026 the physical stuff that things are made up of, but they would just lie there and do nothing if you didn\u2019t have something to set them in motion. The active element of nature is the divine logos, also known as reason\u2026.also known as FATE. I swear the stoics TRIED to confuse people with this stuff. This divine logos is the vehicle by which nature does its bidding and effects the outcomes in the universe, so you can see why the stoics thought of it as fate.\n\nThey thought the universe is made up of four elements\u2026 earth water air and fire. The passive elements were earth and water\u2026 and the ACTIVE elements were fire and air. After the early stoa, Stoics had an extremely detailed account of how the universe was created, but the central themes of their story is that in the beginning everything was made of a mixture of fire and air, the active elements\u2026which then transform in various ways to make the passive elements earth and water\u2026 and then things keep transforming and being guided by the divine logos or reason to form the world that we\u2019re more familiar with. Then eventually everything reverses\u2026 the world we\u2019re familiar with turns back into elements and the elements turn back into the mixture of fire and air. It is an endless eternal cycle. It\u2019s because everything is governed by reason and the fact that THAT reason has had an infinite number of tries at creating the universe that fate exists. There\u2019s only one perfect way to do it, nature would never choose to do it in an inferior way, so things are very predictable. Destined if you will. This mixture of fire and air, the fundamental substance that\u2019s in everything is called Pneuma. Pneuma is a vehicle nature uses to implement the divine logos, do its bidding and effects the outcomes in the universe, so you can see why the stoics thought of it as fate.\n\nThere\u2019s a quote by Stobaeus talking about Chrysippus\u2019 views on the elements and how they make up various things.\n\n\u201cFire, air, water, earth, since all other things are composed by means of a particular one of these or more than one of these or all of these \u2014 all four in the case of animals and all terrestrial compounds, two in the case of the moon, which is composed by means of fire and air, and just one in the case of the sun, which is composed by means of fire, for the sun is pure fire\u201d\n\nIt all comes full circle. Remember stoics think that to live a good or happy life, you need to live a virtuous life. And remember the stoic bumper sticker from earlier: \u201cVirtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature.\u201d Well nature is god and god acts through the divine logos or the reason that governs all things. So humans, with their very unique ability to reason, can think of this reason as a spark or a miniscule fraction of that divine reason. The more you use your reason in accordance with nature the more virtuous you become, and the more virtuous you become, the more in harmony with nature you are. It\u2019s a very nice circle. And the goal of life is to live in harmony with nature.\n\nThis emphasis on humans and their unique ability to reason marking them as distinct from other animals reminds me of a scene from the show LOST. And actually, this crazy elaborate theory of the universe with fire and air and mystery as though it\u2019s just trying bait you into watching six seasons on the edge of your seat\u2026and then they never explain anything\u2026that also reminds me of LOST. I mean come on, Polar Bears?\n\nThe scene that I\u2019m talking about is between John Locke and Charlie the drug addict rock star\u2026 Charlie is trying to quit drugs. he is struggling, John Locke has his drugs to try to act as a barrier between Charlie and relapse. And I love this scene because there are deep implications here. Charlie is sitting around barely even able to strum his guitar\u2026sweating\u2026his bones are obviously hurting\u2026 he looks like he is sick. John Locke comes up to him and tells him he should go for a walk and that the fresh air would do him well. Charlie starts walking and he\u2019s by himself in the middle of this thick tropical woods and he hears something behind him, it\u2019s obviously an animal it sounds like an angry wild pig of some sort and it\u2019s chasing him. so he starts running and the pig keeps chasing him \u2026its very dramatic\u2026and RIGHT WHEN the pig is about to get em\u2026do whatever pigs do when they kill humans\u2026 the pig flies up in the air in an elaborate net trap that John Locke set up to try to catch it. Now Locke planned everything out\u2026he set up TWO traps. One for charlie to be walking and get pursued by the pig\u2026and then charlie would unknowingly run the pig into a separate trap so that he could catch it and eat it.\n\nNow charlies a little upset about being bait for the pig but then he flips out, he starts demanding his drugs saying that he\u2019s sick asking Locke Why can\u2019t I have my drugs? Why do you do this to me\u2026to torture me?\n\nAnd Locke says No. To give you a choice because being able to make choices based on something other than instinct is what separates you from him\u2026and he points to the pig suspended above them in a net trap, obviously not doing too well.\n\nThe idea of cultivating your ability to reason in harmony with nature in Stoicism is very similar to what John Locke is talking about in this scene. The goal of Stoicism was to be completely free of suffering by using our unique ability to reason to make decisions that are in harmony with nature. This state of being was called Apathea, and next episode is going to be all about these kind of things but the important thing is that as humans, the thing we are the best at is thinking\u2026or reasoning\u2026and we should use this reason to figure out the way the world actually is, not what we first think it is. Once we know that, we then realize that the best way to live within the world is to realize that insignificant problems in our everyday lives don\u2019t matter\u2026each human is an infinitely small part of an infinitely large universe that is created and destroyed an infinite number of times\u2026all the little things don\u2019t really matter that much if you use reason. Rational is the opposite i"}, "episode_8": {"date": "2014-4-29", "text": "Posted on April 29, 2014\nEpisode 12 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 12 on Stoic Ethics.\u00a0\n\nMost Philosophy curriculums at Universities don\u2019t go into Hellenistic Stoicism in very much detail, especially the Roman Stoics, the big three\u2026 Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius\u2026and there\u2019s a couple reasons for this. One\u2026 is that there is a rebirth of Stoicism in the 1600\u2019s, it becomes widely discussed, and if you\u2019re an academic and you\u2019re gonna choose whether to study ambiguous re-translated fragments from ancient times or a relatively modern wealth of debate, the choice is easy. The second reason is that the Stoic Ethics that those three men are known for\u2026many philosophers wouldnt even consider them complete Ethics\u2026 they\u2019re not similar to what we\u2019d read if we read Aristotelean Ethics or Platonist Ethics. Usually ethics consists of someone recommending or making a case for what the good life is. This is the RIGHT way to live. Here\u2019s why all these other guys are wrong in what they think the best life is, Here\u2019s why I am right. Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, they don\u2019t really talk about that stuff at all. They don\u2019t dedicate much time to arguing why other people are wrong or introducing a new system of ethics that they created\u2026they all seem to adopt the requisite understanding that Stoic ethics are right\u2026and they spend most of their time saying\u2026 OK, well once you\u2019ve accepted that\u2026what does this mean for you\u2026what does it mean to be a stoic in everyday life, and at MOST this is only ONE branch of Ethics as far as a modern philosophy teacher would see it.\n\nStoic Ethics can be thought of as a means of protecting us from any external adversity that can possibly be thrown our way. If you were doing a late night infomercial for Stoicism during the political trouble of the Hellenistic age, trying to convince people that Stoicism is for everyone, no matter what walk of life you come from\u2026you can\u2019t really ask for three people with more diversity between them than Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius to plead your case. Coming from three COMPLETELY different backgrounds gives them three COMPLETELY unique types of adversity to deal with that were completely different from each other.\n\nSee, Epictetus was a slave who spent most of his life crippled, he spent his life teaching other people to apply Stoicism so they wouldn\u2019t be enslaved within their minds. Stoicism helped him overcome the tribulations of being a slave. Seneca was a Roman statesman who later became the tutor and then political adviser to the murderous crazed-emperor Nero, where despite trying to get out of politics, was forced by Nero to continue working for him and later was forced by Nero to commit suicide. This sort of terrifying existence at the mercy of a crazy person obviously presented its own unique set of adversity that Stoicism helped him through. Marcus Aurelius was the most powerful man in the world\u2026the emperor of Rome, often cited as the last good emperor of Rome, and he didn\u2019t really add anything to Stoicism as Seneca and Epictetus did, but he was seen as a great example of stoicism when applied to a unique set of problems\u2026 and the stuff he wrote down gives us a peek behind the curtains into the thoughts of a dedicated practicing stoic living back then. Now at first you might think\u2026\u201dHe was the emperor of Rome, what kind of problems could he possibly have to be dealing with\u2026\u201d How about the problems of an ENTIRE EMPIRE!? Like most emperors of Rome, constantly at war dealing with border disputes or just outright enemies\u2026I mean he had Germanic barbarians to the north\u2026Parthians to the east. He had plagues wiping people out\u2026he was sick most of his life\u2026all but one of his kids died during his lifetime\u2026not to mention an entire empire to run. There\u2019s a reason your hair starts turning grey when you\u2019re the king of the world. Stoicism was kind of the Just for Men that Marcus Aurelius dabbed around his temples to keep his youthful appearance. Plus, have you seen the movie Gladiator? WAKEEN FEENIX was pretty annoying.\n\nThe passage of time between Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius is a long time. The variance between their opinions on individual issues can also be pretty big, and as a podcaster I have to make a judgment call on where to draw certain lines. When you guys are talking to other people about the stoics, or trying to apply stoicism in your lives or comparing the Stoics with future or past philosophers\u2026you probably aren\u2019t interested in the difference between small things that are only relevant in a very narrow context, for example me rambling on about something like Seneca\u2019s view of virtue in comparison to Epictetus\u2019s view of virtue\u2026and I think even if I did do that\u2026what you guys would ultimately have\u2026is an idea of who each man was, what contributions they made to Stoic Ethics and a general idea of who the Stoics were and what the Stoics were all about. All three of these men had areas of strength within Stoic ethics where they made larger contributions than the other two guys, and in those areas we will dedicate more time to what they had to say on the topic, but because there is so much overlap between them, I think this episode is going to work best if we talk about the tenets of stoic ethics, the common threads among them all that forge the definition of what a Stoic is and then refer back to quotes from each man to not only embellish what we\u2019ve already laid out, but to offer insight.\n\nThat said, the central point\u2026the thing that all stoic ethics are centered around is the idea of Oikeosis. This word is an adaptation of the Greek word oikos\u2026which roughly translates to house\u2026or orientation\u2026it was referring to the idea that each thing, whether its an insect, an animal, a plant\u2026a human\u2026all of these things have a disposition assigned to it by Nature. Certain things that it was put here to do. For an animal like a\u2026skunk it was easy. survival. self-preservation. eat, sleep, reproduce\u2026but for humans, it was more. it included all that, it included self-preservation\u2026 but it also included rationality\u2026we have a very unique ability to reason, and we should use it\u2026we were put here to use it.\nthere are TV shows out there like the Real Word\u2026or Jersey Shore\u2026where the cast is made up of young people going out drinking and partying most nights\u2026with about as many priorities set in their proper place as they have IQ points combined between the group of them. And there\u2019s a recurring character on these shows that shows up once every couple seasons where they\u2019re living in the real world house\u2026but they have a boyfriend or girlfriend at home, and yet they still feel compelled to go out drinking and start flirting with other people. and right as they\u2019re about to do their 8th shot of the night the show cuts to them in an interview earlier in the day where they say something like \u201cHopefully, I don\u2019t cheat on my boyfriend\u2026Hopefully nothing happens\u2026\u201d you know\u2026where they\u2019re shrugging as they say it just looking at the camera with a blank stare.\nBehold everyone! The stoics would see this human as one that\u2019s acting like it has the oikos of a skunk, or any animal for that matter. These people don\u2019t see themselves as creatures with an oikos of reason\u2026with the ability to make rational decisions that are in harmony with nature\u2026they see themselves as passengers\u2026whatever happens\u2026happens. This is the same point I was talking about last time with the scene from LOST. The pig trapped in the net has a different oikos than Charlie the drug addict rock star\u2026and John Locke was trying to help him realize this.\nMarcus Aurelius says that everything, a horse, a vine, is created for some duty. and that man\u2019s true delight is to do the things he was made for.\n\nAlright so remember this concept of our oikos, cause we haven\u2019t fully discussed what it is yet, and we will be returning to it a little later, but this sets a nice base for talking about Stoicism applied to our everyday lives. One of the most important topics of Stoic ethics, one that they repeatedly hammer home and make it clear that it\u2019s very important is understanding the distinction between things we CAN control and things we CANT control. The stoics thought that out of all the areas we dedicate thought to, this is the one that we get wrong the most. Let me give you an example of someone you might know:\nSome people are die hard sports fans. Some people have a team that they\u2019re loyal to, they know all their players, they know the stats\u2026they wear their autographed jersey to work on casual Friday\u2026and when they watch a game and their favorite player hits the game winning shot, or the team is playing well together\u2026they\u2019re walking on sunshine for the rest of the day\u2026but when their team is playing bad\u2026or the referee makes a bad call against their team and their team loses\u2026they\u2019ll yell at the TV, slam doors, get angry\u2026make the rest of the people living in the house uncomfortable. These people are allowing themselves to be made either happy or angry by the decisions of a select few people that don\u2019t know that they\u2019re a fan, they don\u2019t care about their opinion, and they would trade their favorite player in a heartbeat if it meant a better bottom-line for them. The stoics would say, they have ABSOLUTELY ZERO control over anything that\u2019s happening there\u2026why would they allow themselves to be so negatively affected by it? Now most of us come to this conclusion without the help of the stoics, but this same concept applies to everything, no matter how small.\n\nLike I said, the Stoics separated all things into two categories, things we do control and things we don\u2019t control. The things we do control are our thoughts and actions. The things we don\u2019t control are\u2026well\u2026everything else.\nSee, as humans, we are survival oriented creatures\u2026we like stability. we like predictability. this is why people typically say we have a fear of the unknown. we like to have a particular way we react to a particular circumstance\u2026we don\u2019t like the fact that at any point in time we could get hit by a city bus, or someone could stab us\u2026or a friend could betray us. we don\u2019t like it, but its reality. we don\u2019t actually control anything that happens external to us. but that doesn\u2019t mean we should walk around being scared of this stuff all the time, the stoics thought we should recognize how out of our control it actually is. We like to think that things like our body\u2026our bank account balance\u2026our car\u2026our reputation\u2026we like to think that were in control of these things. But the stoics make the case that all of those things really ARENT in our control because at any time someone could steal your car\u2026someone could destroy your reputation\u2026your body could randomly have a brain aneurysm and to base your happiness on something that you have no control over is a recipe for disaster. They called all of these things\u2026even things that happened in your past\u2026all of these external things that we have no control over\u2026they called them Indifferents. Being in a state free of suffering because you understand which things are in and out of your control was called apathea. But don\u2019t mistake this with the modern word that sounds like it\u2026apathy\u2026which would mean not caring about what happens one way or another. They DID have a preference. There were preferred indifferents and unpreferred indifferents. Let me explain.\n\nEven though we want these indifferents\u2026like to be healthy or to have a good reputation\u2026these things aren\u2019t good in themselves. This is an idea that goes ALL THE WAY back to the Cynics\u2026the only thing that is intrinsically good, or good in itself, not requiring anything else to be considered \u201cgood\u201d are wisdom and virtue. And even the idea of qualifying something as intrinsically good goes all the way back to something Plato said in his Phaedo that if something is truly good\u2026it would never even assist something that\u2019s bad\u2026so to the Stoics, even something like health was an indifferent\u2026because its only good in relation to the person who its making healthy\u2026like\u2026the health of Adolph Hitler in 1939 wasn\u2019t a very good thing. Good Health, and many other things would be considered PREFERRED indifferents, outcomes that are typically good for us, but we have no control over.\nBut just because we didn\u2019t control when or if they happen to us, doesn\u2019t mean that we cant make choices about how we perceive them. Remember the things we DO control\u2026our thoughts and actions. The stoics thought all of our thoughts and actions about the things that happen to us in our lives fall somewhere on a large spectrum between what they called virtue and vice, but in modern times what we would think of as a spectrum between rational thinking and irrational thinking. The guy from the sports analogy we were talking about before\u2026the guy that puts a trashcan on his head and runs into the nearest wall because his team lost\u2026that guy\u2019s thoughts and actions are leaning towards the IRRATIONAL side of the spectrum. Our goal as humans is to be as close to the rational side of the spectrum as possible.\n\nHave you ever heard someone say\u2026there\u2019s no manual or handbook for living life? Well, Epictetus would beg to differ\u2026his students collected a ton of his most insightful and wise statements and compiled them into a book called \u201cThe Enchiridion\u201d, or the handbook. He contributed a lot to this discussion about things we can control and things we cant control\u2026and it makes sense. He was a slave\u2026for years of his life he had no choice but to grin and bear the fact that he was shackled and forced to do manual labor. He talks about the importance and potential gain when you understand the things you can and cant control here in his Discourses\u2026and we pick up the quote right after he just got done describing something terrible happening to someone that was completely out of their control:\n\n\u201cWhat then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? What else than \u201cWhat is mine, and what is not mine; and permitted to me, and what is not permitted to me.\u201d I must die. Must I then die lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment? \u201cTell me the secret which you possess.\u201d I will not, for this is in my power. \u201cBut I will put you in chains.\u201d Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself can overpower. \u201cI will throw you into prison.\u201d My poor body, you mean. \u201cI will cut your head off.\u201d When, then, have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise themselves. \u201d\n\nOnce we realize what is in and out of our control, then the Stoics say that we can use our ability to reason to not walk around expecting things that are out of our control to happen or not happen. recognize these things for what they really are\u2026once your perception of reality is closer to reality\u2026then your expectations will be closer to reality.\n\nIf some guy that lived on the other side of town from you, who you don\u2019t know at all, suddenly decides he is going to change his career from the president of a bank, to a circus performer\u2026would it bother you that you cant control his job situation? you wouldn\u2019t be at all\u2026knock yourself out! but that same guy, if when he was on his way to his new job as a circus performer cuts us off on the freeway\u2026and all of a sudden..were angry about that. The truth is\u2026We have about as much control over his decision to change from bank president to circus performer as we do over his decision to cut us off on the freeway\u2026why do we react differently? well, its an expectation\u2026we have an expectation that that guys gonna follow some unspoken set of rules that all drivers have consented to\u2026 without exception and he is never going to make a mistake. the stoics would say that this isn\u2019t realistic\u2026this isn\u2019t a realistic expectation because we don\u2019t have any control over what he does anyway so what good is being upset about it.\n\nMarcus Aurelius talks about the idea of expectations a lot in his Meditations:\n\n\u201cIf you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happy. And there is no man able to prevent this.\u201d\n\nHe also said:\n\n\u201cGet rid of the judgment, get rid of the \u2018I am hurt,\u2019 you are rid of the hurt itself.\u201d\n\nYou may be saying to yourself that so far, Stoicism sounds a lot like Buddhism. Well you\u2019re right, this is actually a very common thing that people notice. There are a lot of similarities between the two\u2026not the least of which is the whole idea that there aren\u2019t any things that are inherently favorable or unfavorable to us in themselves\u2026it\u2019s our interpretation of those things that determine what they are\u2026not to mention\u2026Siddhartha Gautama suggested that people practice meditation to stay in the present moment and assist you on your quest to happiness, AND SO DID THE STOICS! They just had a much more proactive and pessimistic approach. Remember, I said in the last show that Stoicism was kind of like an obstacle course or a training regimen. Epictetus said:\n\n\u201cWhat then should each of us say as each hardship befalls us? It was for this that I was exercising, It was for this that I was training.\u201d\n\nThe stoics thought of it this way\u2026it wasn\u2019t good enough just to KNOW what stoic beliefs were\u2026or to understand their ethics\u2026philosophy was an Active process\u2026one where you constantly remind yourself of tenets of stoicism and by always having them on the top of your mind, you create new habits of thinking that are in line with the tenets of stoicism. One of the practical methods of doing this that the Stoics suggest is a sort of pre-meditation. Marcus Aurelius describes it here:\n\u201cBegin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil.\u201d\nLet\u2019s go back to the sports fan example from earlier\u2026the way it stands now, this guy watches his sports games and at some level doesn\u2019t expect anything bad to happen at all, despite the fact that every weekend when he watches the game\u2026something bad happens. What Marcus Aurelius is talking about in that quote, and many of the Stoics talked about this, is that every morning this sports fan should prepare himself for what inevitably will come\u2026bad calls. He should tell himself: Today my team WILL lose the coin toss\u2026.today my team WILL have a terrible injury that ruins our chances for the rest of the season\u2026today the refs WILL make a terrible call\u2026and we WILL lose the game because of it\u2026\nMarcus Aurelius said:\n\n\u201cYour mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. Soak it then in such trains of thoughts as, for example: Where life is possible at all, a right life is possible.\u201d\n\nWhat are you accomplishing by saying all of that\u2026what are the stoics teaching you to do? They\u2019re teaching you to lower your expectations. If you approach the big game on Sunday pessimistically, if you truly expect that all of those terrible things are gonna happen, then when they DO happen, it was to be expected\u2026when they don\u2019t happen\u2026you\u2019re pleasantly surprised. Well this practice isn\u2019t just useful for sports games\u2026the stoics thought you should start EVERY day with this sort of mentality, and that same guy that gets upset about things he cant control while watching sports, probably gets upset about things he cant control on the road, in his office, in his marriage, etc.\n\nThis is the area of Stoicism that Seneca really excelled in. He famously said \u201cThat which Fortune has not given, she cannot take away.\u201d He has a book called \u201cOn the shortness of life\u201d, where it\u2019s all about the common human misconception that life is too short where Seneca says that it\u2019s not that we weren\u2019t given enough life to live, it\u2019s that we waste so much of it. He tells a story about a prisoner who was locked up in his cell, awaiting his punishment for a crime\u2026and the emperor of Rome at the time, Caligula, sentences him to death and when the guards come to get the prisoner from his cell to kill him\u2026hes playing a game with a guard that was assigned to watch over him\u2026and these other guards show up and tell him he\u2019s sentenced to death and they start dragging him away to be killed and as these guards are dragging him away he says to them\u2026\u201dYou guys are my witnesses\u2026I was up by ONE PIECE there! I beat him!\u201d\n\nThis sort of calmness in the face of problems is a hallmark of stoicism. When we think of the word stoic in modern times we think of someone who is unaffected\u2026or ostensibly unaffected\u2026and that may be true but it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not like the stoics didn\u2019t FEEL emotions\u2026they were just complete MASTERS of their emotions. Some stoics even take this mastery of emotions to the level where emotions don\u2019t even exist to them\u2026Seneca said that The idea of \u201cmoderate emotions,\u201d is about as realistic as the idea of \u201cmoderate insanity\u201d Emotions themselves are irrational\u2026there\u2019s no use trying to moderate them\u2026we should train our brain to think rationally. The important part is this: Don\u2019t let a single positive or negative emotion affect you too much\u2026Don\u2019t let a single compliment go to your head and make you think you\u2019re the greatest ever\u2026and don\u2019t let a single insult get you down and make you think you\u2019re a loser. Back to the sports analogy, don\u2019t let a single win let you think your team is destined to win the championship and don\u2019t let a single loss let you get down on future prospects.\n\nBeing a slave, Epictetus had some good things to say on this topic too he said:\n\nMen are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things.\nhe also said:\n\nIf a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you?\u201d\n\nOur thoughts create our negative emotions. The most common and arguably the most destructive of all these negative emotions is Anger. By far, the most popular work by Seneca, and my favorite to read is called \u201cOn Anger\u201d It\u2019s an entire book dedicated to analyzing and dealing with\u2026Anger. He famously said that \u201cNo plague has cost the human race more, than anger.\u201d According to Seneca there are four primary emotions\u2026two emotions thinking about the present time and two thinking about the future. Pleasure\u2026which thinks that something is good right now\u2026Pain\u2026which thinks that something is bad right now\u2026Desire\u2026which thinks that something will be good in the future\u2026and fear which thinks that something will be bad in the future. Anger, to Seneca, is a type of desire. Because an angry person is always thinking about revenge in the future.\n\nHe compares the irrationality of anger with proper rational thought here:\n\n\u201cAnger is altogether inconsistent. Sometimes it goes further than it should, Sometimes it stops short. It indulges itself, judges capriciously, refuses to listen, leaves no room for defense, clings to what it has seized and will not have its judgment, even a wrong judgment, taken from it. Reason gives time to either side, and then demands a further adjournment to give itself room to tease out the truth: anger is in a hurry. Reason wishes to pass a fair judgment: anger wishes the judgment which it has already passed to seem fair. Reason considers nothing save the matter at issue; anger is roused by irrelevant trifles.\u201d\n\nHe spends a good deal of time in \u201cOn Anger\u201d addressing the common misconception that people have that anger is something that is entirely out of their control\u2026as though it\u2019s involuntary\u2026some sort of instinct that\u2019s programmed in us\u2026he makes a case for how the two are not the same here:\n\u201ctake the way that we shiver when cold water is sprinkled on us, or recoil at the touch of some things take the way that bad news makes our hair stand on end and indecent language brings on a blush. None of these is in our power; no amount of reasoning can induce them not to happen. But anger IS put to flight by precept. For it IS a voluntary fault of the mind and not one of those which occur through some quirk of the human condition can therefore happen to the very wisest of men, even though they include that first mental jolt which affects us when we think ourselves wronged. \u201d\n\nHe says that most people see the process of anger as something bad happens to you\u2026and then now I need to get back at that person. But Seneca says that it is much more complex than that\u2026there are actually four stages to anger\u2026realization, indignation, condemnation and retribution\u2026he says it well here:\n\n\u201cTo receive an impression of wrong done to one, to lust for retribution, to put together the two propositions that the damage ought not to have been done and that punishment ought to be inflicted, is not the work of a mere involuntary impulse. That would be a simple process. What we have here is a complex with several constituents \u2014 realization, indignation, condemnation, retribution. These cannot occur without assent by the mind to whatever has struck it.\u201d\n\nThe first step is realization\u2026this is the moment you realize that someone has done something bad to you\u2026this is the moment you realize a referee just made a terrible call on the television against your team.\n\nThe second step is indignation\u2026that bad thing just happened to you, and now you have contempt for the person that wronged you\u2026the referee just cost my team the game\u2026i hate them now.\n\nThe third step is condemnation\u2026now that this person is contemptible, now you label them as a bad person that deserves punishment for how they\u2019ve wronged you\u2026this is you saying that the referee should lose his job\u2026that he should keep his ref uniform and just go work at footlocker where he belongs\u2026\n\nThe fourth step is retribution\u2026this is the childish idea of exacting revenge\u2026you know I need to get BACK at them for what they\u2019ve done to me\u2026in the referee example there\u2019s all sorts of things you can do here, but I guess one of them would be you organizing a petition to send to the NFL to get the referee fired for his terrible mistake.\n\nSo anger is actually a pretty lengthy process even though it happens so quickly in the moment. It certainly isn\u2019t the same as the involuntary shiver that happens when cold water is sprinkled on us like Seneca talks about. He gives several recommendations throughout the book, one of them is adjusting the way you look at the world to ensure that you have more realistic expectations of what is going to happen to you\u2026adopting a more pessimistic view like we talked about before\u2026and using mental gymnastics, like reading a mantra to yourself at the beginning of the day expecting bad things to happen\u2026constantly referencing the principles of stoicism in your mind to form good habits of thought\u2026things like that.\n\nSo this idea of having realistic expectations is definitely powerful, but I\u2019d imagine some of you are saying something like\u2026Well, I can change my world view and have realistic expectations\u2026but what if even THOSE expectations get broken\u2026then I should be really mad\u2026and on that same note, what about someone who has unrealistic expectations, but they have the ability to accept the fact that expectations wont be met sometimes?\u201d\n\nThis point is the reason why I believe that happiness doesn\u2019t lie in low expectations like a lot of people say\u2026it lies in acceptance. And this acceptance of everything that happens to you\u2026the acceptance of your fate is a hallmark of stoicism.\n\nDeterminism is a very broad concept in philosophy that says that when something happens\u2026something is the case that makes it so that nothing else could have happened. There are TONS of different kinds of determinism, many of them differing in their idea of what that THING IS that makes it so that nothing else could have happened. Things are destined\u2026Now, Some people might instantly think that this implies some kind of magical thinking, but not necessarily. Yes, it could be the providential plan of a God at work, but it could also be entirely non-magical..like the idea that the brain is a computer basically and based on the input you\u2019ve received so far\u2026there IS a reaction that will happen\u2026you THINK you\u2019re making a conscious decision, but really it was the inevitable process of the brain you\u2019ve been given combined with your experiences. This is a VERY broad topic with MANY different varieties\u2026all of them have names\u2026the relationship between free will and determinism is one of the most widely discussed topics in all of philosophy..and trust me, the works of the stoics are not our best option of content to reference when talking about it. There are much better options\u2026not to mention\u2026within stoicism it\u2019s one of the most controversial topics. The most important thing to take from their views on the matter is that they were compatiblists. They believed that the idea of determinism and the idea of free will are compatible with each other. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive as many people think.\n\nThey believed in the idea of fate\u2026but the important part is not the magical aspect to fate\u2026the important part is the acceptance that you get from that mentality. Zeno and Chrysippus compared humans going throughout their life on planet earth to dogs that were tied to the back of a cart. Just imagine that visual\u2026a big cart tied to the back of a horse is moving along a path\u2026and someone tied a dog to the back of it. The movement of the cart represents fate\u2026god\u2019s plan\u2026the reason that governs all things\u2026and we, as humans are the dog. We\u2019re going where ever the carts going\u2026there\u2019s no fighting it\u2026the question is, how much are we going to whine and complain and struggle along the way. Think of yourself as a foot that is part of a human. What if you were a foot? You\u2019d just be one small part of a giant body doing its purpose until you stop working one day. It would be ridiculous for you to say to the body\u2026\u201dNo\u2026I\u2019m not speaking to you. I refuse to walk around anymore\u2026I refuse to do my foot duties\u201d No, that would be ridiculous right? Because the foot needs to realize that what is in the best interest of the body is in the best interest of the foot. It needs to fill its role and not complain. The stoics thought this is the way humans should look at themselves in relation to the world. One small part, doing its duty for the greater whole.\n\nSeveral years ago I got an English Bulldog\u2026I named him Charlie\u2026and he is adorable. That is his only good quality. If you\u2019ve never had an English Bulldog, they are notoriously stubborn. They\u2019re very difficult to train\u2026some people can do it\u2026I\u2019ve seen it before\u2026I have massive respect for you if you can\u2026but I sit there with a treat in my hand telling him to sit\u2026and I just look into his blank eyes staring at the treat\u2026and after four or five times of telling him to sit\u2026I just give him the treat. Well one day I made a huge mistake, whenever we go anywhere I put him in the laundry room and a couple years ago he refused to go in. He just stared at me, so I got a treat, coaxed him into the laundry room, gave him the treat closed the door\u2026Problem solved\u2026Evolution everybody, it\u2019s wonderful. But it wasn\u2019t wonderful\u2026NOW he doesn\u2019t come in unless if he gets the treat. I tell him\u2026\u201dGet in your room.\u201d and he looks at me\u2026and doesn\u2019t move\u2026he wants the treat\u2026and hes not moving until he gets it\u2026its like a reverse hunger strike\u2026i say \u201cget in your room\u201d he starts going \u201chmmmmm\u2026..hmmmm\u201d This next sentence is gonna make me sound crazy. If Charlie was a human\u2026and the Stoics were around to see this behavior\u2026they would give him a stern talking to. I mean I give him an ENDLESS WATERFALL of food and water\u2026a couch to sleep on\u2026and he has ONE JOB and that\u2019s to get into the laundry room when were leaving the house\u2026and like the dog tied to the back of the cart\u2026like humans tied to the inevitable process of fate\u2026he whines and struggles, but eventually he gets in the laundry room. He always does. Stoicism says we should have resigned acceptance and just cut out that whole process of whining and struggling\u2026and just get in the laundry room.\n\nEpictetus says it well when he says:\n\n\u201cdon\u2019t demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen and you will go on well.\u201d\n\nMarcus Aurelius says:\n\n\u201cthe good mans only singularity lies in his approving w"}, "episode_9": {"date": "2014-4-29", "text": "Posted on April 29, 2014\nEpisode 13 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 13 on Skepticism.\u00a0\n\nSo we\u2019ve covered quite a bit of ground in the Hellenistic Age so far, and I want to tie it together a little bit. There were four main schools of philosophy in the Hellenistic Age the Epicureans, the Stoics, the skeptics and the cynics\u2026all of these schools trying to cope with all the problems for the average citizen in the Hellenistic Age that were seemingly impossible to deal with. The goal of all of these schools was to achieve this \u201cfreedom from disturbance\u201d sometimes described as ataraxia\u2026 sometimes described as a tranquil state of mind, but although the end goal of all of these schools was the same\u2026if you looked at a member from each one of them on the streets, they would look COMPLETELY different from each other, because each of them had a very unique way of achieving it. If you lived back then, you would have several options\u2026so which one best suits you?\n\nYour first option is to be an Epicurean. You\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0worry about the fact that your family just got sold into slavery, or your town just got burned to to the ground\u2026because all you really are anyway is a random collection of\u00a0atoms. There is no god that you\u2019re beholden to, there is no afterlife to be scared of\u2026so why worry? You should position yourself as best you can to do what you were put here to do\u2026to experience the higher pleasures and achieve a complete freedom from disturbance. You\u2019d dress modestly, you\u2019d eat in good proportion, you\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0have a bunch of stuff or big dreams of being a figure in politics\u2026you would resign from public life and\u00a0live on a commune, away from the busy city\u2026 living a subsistent lifestyle with your friends. And your friends, were extremely important to you. They were your way of achieving this state of tranquility, the complete removal of pain.\n\nYour second option was to be a Cynic. For the sake of keeping it simple, think of the extreme version. Think of Diogenes. You wouldn\u2019t worry about losing your house or your job or your status among society in the Hellenistic Age, because who cares about all that stuff? They\u2019re all meaningless social conventions that have been imposed upon us\u2026other people have somehow convinced themselves that they\u2019re something to worry about\u2026but not you. Through not caring about these things, you would achieve a state of flourishing and tranquility of mind. You would live in squalor, perhaps in a tub or in modern times, a cardboard box, but to you it wouldn\u2019t feel like squalor\u2026it would feel natural. You\u2019d do whatever you wanted to do\u2026you\u2019d go wherever you wanted to go\u2026You\u2019d wear whatever clothes you wanted to wear, if any at all.\n\nYour third option was to be a Stoic. You wouldn\u2019t worry about an evil dictator riding into town because no matter what happens, it was destined to happen. Everything that happens is part of the providential plan of God, the guiding hand of reason that is inside everything, and questioning it was as unwise as it was futile. You were tied to the inevitability of fate like a dog was tied to a moving cart being pulled by a horse. How much are you going to whine about where you are going whether you like it or not? Through this acceptance of fate and cultivation of realistic expectations of the world, you achieved a freedom from disturbance. Knowing the right way to act in every situation was using your ability to reason to live virtuously and in accordance with nature. You would perform a preemptive meditation to start the day\u2026telling yourself that you WILL be met with morons and inconsiderate people\u2026thus rendering you impervious from anger or dissatisfaction\u2026.throughout the day you would review and reference your stoic handbook\u2026refreshing the content and keeping it at the top of your mind\u2026you would be constantly working\u2026being mindful of your thoughts \u2026brainwashing yourself into productive habits of thought\u2026like modern cognitive behavior therapy. You\u2019d be active in politics\u2026or at least in the community\u2026because it was your oikos to assist others in their quest to develop and use their ability to reason as best they can, and what better place to influence others than in the Senate of the most powerful civilization on the planet?\n\nWell, your last option would be to be a Skeptic. And of all the schools, this one was probably the one that when it comes down to achieving ataraxia by actually practicing all the ideas\u2026it\u2019s gotta be the hardest. Almost impractical. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other school in the Hellenistic Age that changed philosophy more. Just to get an idea of how this wave of skepticism rolled over the other schools of the Hellenistic age and to understand where skepticism found an obvious and convenient foothold, I think it\u2019s illustrated best when talking about it in relation to Stoic Epistemology.\n\nThese schools of the Hellenistic Age were in such heated competition with each other that it\u2019s easy to think of them as being on completely different ends of the spectrum from one another\u2026This school and this school are NOTHING alike. But that\u2019s really not the case\u2026they all influenced each other at ton and really were just talking about different answers to the same questions. Maybe a better way to think of them is\u2026 if YOU were a school in the Hellenistic Age\u2026the other schools were like ambitious rival coworkers all shooting for the promotion that you want\u2026 they\u2019d be showing up early to work like you\u2026they\u2019d be working hard like you. If you want that promotion that\u2019s coming up\u2026and you don\u2019t want them to get it\u2026you better keep working hard. Those people would keep you honest\u2026and their competition would make you better in many ways. Well, When any one of these schools made a claim about something, the other schools found the flaws in it, jumped on them, argued about it, offered a counter-argument, etc. And one of the biggest claims around this time was in regards to the concept of epistemology.\n\nIf you remember, the Epicureans were all about disproving any sort of supernatural explanation for anything happening, and in the process of this, sometimes they were guilty of prematurely accepting anything that seemed like a reasonable explanation simply for the sake of having SOME rational explanation. Well Zeno was no doubt responding to this line of reasoning in some way when he put together his multifaceted visual explanation for stoic epistemology that we talked about last time. And this is the most important part: The Epicureans thought we could attain true knowledge, but were a little too cavalier about it. The Stoics thought we could attain true knowledge, certainty IS possible\u2026but they had a multi-part system of qualifications of what constitutes knowledge, and the skeptics thought having knowledge was impossible.\n\nLets go back to Zeno and his example. Zeno would be giving a lecture in the painted stoa and he would hold his hand out\u2026palm completely open and he would say \u201cthis is perception\u201d. Well he kind of says it right there, perception isn\u2019t knowledge. It\u2019s just the first step towards having knowledge. The stoics would eventually settle with calling what we receive during this perception phase as \u201cimpressions\u201d. Now, it\u2019s a little complicated and we can\u2019t call them strictly empiricists, but we can rest assured knowing that the information received by the senses was incredibly important to them. These impressions our sense organs pick up are how we gather information from the physical world around us, and they\u2019re important because they\u2019re the first step towards arriving at knowledge. Zeno and Cleanthes compared these impressions to imprints made in wax. Let\u2019s do an example of an impression\u2026lets say you\u2019re sleeping\u2026you\u2019re having a pleasant dream\u2026finally getting that 8 hours of sleep you\u2019ve been wanting all week\u2026and bam\u2026a car alarm goes off in front of your house. and it keeps going and going and going\u2026and you\u2019re just laying there with your red eyes\u2026staring up at your popcorn ceiling saying \u201creally?\u201d just wondering if a car alarm has ever prevented a single car theft in the history of the world. Now, you can\u2019t see the car\u2026you\u2019re lying in bed. You can\u2019t touch the car\u2026all you can do is hear it. The alarm\u2026the siren is giving your sense organs\u2026in this case your ears\u2026an impression that a car alarm is going off. Well how do you know that? You can\u2019t know for sure right? What if it\u2019s an air raid siren\u2026what if an ambulance is just idling in your neighbors driveway with its siren on\u2026filibustering your sleep schedule? Now, the Epicureans would say that the impression you received was true, but if it wasn\u2019t a car alarm, your mind wrongly assigned an interpretation to the impression. The stoics don\u2019t think this way..they think that some impressions are true, and some impressions are false. they would say, \u201cyeah, it sure does SOUND like a car alarm is going off, but it\u2019s your decision to assent to that impression\u201d you could easily look out the window and be shocked to see that overnight some strange people had set up a casino in your neighbors driveway, and that the siren that woke you up and wont stop is the sound of someone winning the jackpot on a slot machine. In THAT case, you wouldn\u2019t assent to idea that a car alarm woke you up. But on the other hand, you could go to your window\u2026see the car\u2019s headlights flashing and the noise clearly coming from that direction in your neighbors driveway and be pretty sure that it was a car alarm that woke you up.\n\nThis leads me to the second phase of Zeno\u2019s visual teaching example\u2026the one where he takes his open palm extended in front of him and closes his fingers just a little bit\u2026i said Zeno with arthritis last time\u2026it looks like Zeno if he was pretending to be a cat\u2026about to claw someone\u2026this phase is called assent. Assent is a belief in something. An agreement with something. You believe it was a car alarm that woke you up\u2026it\u2019s not a mere impression\u2026it\u2019s not just hearing what sounds like a car alarm and assuming it is one. You have processed the sound and the sight impressions through your ability to reason and arrived at a belief in something. you know, a cow has sense organs\u2026he has impressions of the world\u2026but humans can question those impressions\u2026they can use reason to determine that things aren\u2019t what they seem. a stoic sage would suspend judgment on whether something was true or not until they were absolutely certain\u2026until they had what they called, a cognitive impression.\n\nThis is the third phase of Zeno\u2019s hand analogy\u2026he would close his hand completely and make a fist and say \u201cthis is comprehension\u201d. Sometimes we have impressions that are really solid\u2026impressions that are so clear it almost seems impossible for them to be wrong. Back to the car alarm example\u2026Lets say you don\u2019t just go to the window and see the car alarm going off\u2026lets say you go outside and really examine the car, find the exact part of the engine compartment the alarm is coming out of\u2026touch the car..make sure it\u2019s not a hologram\u2026.you know stuff like that\u2026you could leave that experience almost certain that it was a car alarm that woke you up. This is what the stoics would call a cognitive impression\u2026an impression that is crystal clear and reinforced. But it\u2019s important to note that we STILL don\u2019t have knowledge as far as the stoics are concerned. These cognitive impressions were an essential element when arriving at knowledge, but knowledge really lies in understanding the relations between all of these cognitive impressions.\n\nThere\u2019s a famous story about a stoic philosopher that was a follower of Zeno named Sphaerus where he\u2019s having a conversation with King Ptolemy and the king asks him \u201cwill a wise man ever allow himself to be guided by opinion alone?\u201d and Sphaerus says No, but little did he know that the king KNEW he would say this and had someone manufacture some fake pomegranates made out of wax. They looked just like a real pomegranate, but were in reality\u2026fake. And he served them to Sphaerus. And he bites into one of them\u2026spits it out and is fooled\u2026.and the king goes \u201cha! what now? who\u2019s falsely assenting now son?\u201d Well, Sphaerus said he didn\u2019t assent to the fact that they WERE pomegranates\u2026only to the idea that it was reasonable to assume that they were pomegranates. The wise man will always suspend judgment until he is absolutely certain.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this crossroads where the skeptics find a foothold in the Hellenistic Age. The stoics say you should suspend judgment until you\u2019re absolutely certain, and the skeptics say that you can NEVER be absolutely certain, as far as we can tell. See, a big part of knowledge for the stoics were these cognitive impressions, and what the skeptics said is that every cognitive impression, no matter how solid it may seem\u2026will be indistinguishable from some other impression. Impossible to tell the difference between the two. For example, let\u2019s say you just paid for your groceries at the grocery store\u2026you walk out of the grocery store and see your car. but is it really your car? everything seems the same\u2026its parked in the same spot you parked it in\u2026it\u2019s the same color\u2026it\u2019s got YOUR air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror\u2026some wild and crazy 12 yr old kid wrote wash me on your dirty back window in the same spot\u2026you\u2019re pretty certain this is your car\u2026but the skeptics would say that even despite all this checking\u2026you cant know that for sure. you could be on a Japanese hidden camera prank show right now\u2026your friends could be in on it\u2026someone could have orchestrated everything\u2026they towed your car away\u2026they got an IDENTICAL replica of your car, they parked it there, they made it dirty and wrote wash me into the back window in the exact same place\u2026how do you know its your car absolutely? can you? The skeptics would say no\u2026this uncertainty, no matter how ridiculous it may seem in a practical sense\u2026 is impossible to escape\u2026everything has this plague of doubt attached to it. and how can we honestly say we knew something for certain if this doubt exists?\n\nThis is probably a good time to talk about the man who is widely considered the first skeptic in the history of the world, Pyrrho of Elis. I\u2019m starting to notice a pattern here\u2026if you\u2019re a figurehead for a particular movement\u2026if you\u2019re one of the founding fathers of something and you lived during a time when historical details are scarce\u2026you instantly inherit a sort of mystical, legendary status where stories are told about you exhibiting EXTREME behaviors in line with your movement. Pyrrho was really skeptical. He didn\u2019t believe anything. There are stories of him getting surgery in 300 BC and despite being completely awake\u2026he was unaffected. He lied in silence without so much as a twitch of his face as someone dug into his body\u2026because he wasn\u2019t under the delusion like everyone else that pain was a bad thing necessarily. There\u2019s another story of his good friend falling into a hole and he\u2019s unable to get out\u2026Pyrrho comes across him\u2026sees him in the hole\u2026and just leaves him there. And his friend wasn\u2019t even mad at him\u2026he was just impressed\u2026he deeply respected his ability to be so skeptical. There are stories of Pyrrho walking around with complete skepticism of everything around him\u2026he was like an elderly woman\u2026he would walk into people\u2026in front of wagons\u2026apparently his friends would have to save him from the brink of walking into his certain death all the time. And despite all these stories\u2026he lived to the very old age of 90. Well these stories are obviously fiction, but they do illustrate an extreme version of Pyrrho\u2019s line of skeptical thinking. It probably isn\u2019t a shock that Pyrrho didn\u2019t believe in writing things down either\u2026so one of his lead disciples Timon wrote about his beliefs and a later philosopher talks about them here:\n\n\u201cAccording to Timon, Pyrrho declared that things are equally indifferent, unmeasurable and inarbitrable. For this reason neither our sensations nor our opinions tell us truths or falsehoods. Therefore, for this reason we should not put our trust in them one bit, but we should be unopinionated, uncommitted and unwavering, saying concerning each individual thing that it no more is than is not, or it both is and is not, or it neither is nor is not. The outcome for those who actually adopt this attitude, says Timon, will be first speechlessness, and then freedom from disturbance\u201d\n\nFreedom from disturbance. That was the whole point. The skeptics were in heavy competition with other philosophical schools that claimed to bring you a state of tranquility\u2026and their method of of achieving it was through realizing that negative feelings come from negative judgments about things, but you don\u2019t know whether those things are actually bad\u2026you can\u2019t prove that they are absolutely bad\u2026so how can you arrogantly assume that you know? How do you know that pain is a BAD thing necessarily? How do you KNOW that losing your farm is a bad thing necessarily? Pyrrho said that we should suspend judgment on everything until we know for certain that it is the truth, which we never can.\n\nIt was a new way of thinking and many historians think that when Pyrrho was a soldier in the army of Alexander the Great when he was young\u2026he traveled east and was either heavily inspired by or just stole the idea from what they called the \u201cnaked philosophers\u201d of India. We talked on the Buddhism episode about this way of looking at the mind as being misleading and that by conceding to the impulses of the mind, often times it accomplishes the opposite of what you were intending. Couple this with a few strands of skepticism that can be found in earlier presocratic philosophers, and you get a pretty good idea where Pyrrho was coming from when he developed his version of skepticism. There are several examples\u2026but just for example\u2026remember Parmenides talking about how everyone THINKS the world is moving around them, but in reality NOTHING is moving? Not to mention one of my favorite quotes ever as said by Democritus\u2026remember? By convention sweet, by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention color: but in reality atoms and void. Skepticism had been around for a while, but not as an attitude that you apply to anything\u2026not as a Hellenistic School designed to bring freedom from disturbance. And that\u2019s another thing\u2026like the other schools that claimed to be heavily influenced by Socrates, the skeptics were too. Remember it was Socrates that said the only thing I know is that I know nothing. When Socrates says it that way\u2026it\u2019s sort of clever and paradoxical, and he was making a deeper point really. But when Pyrrho says it\u2026it starts to look like hypocrisy. Pyrrho thought that:\n\n\u201cnothing is honourable or base, or just or unjust, and that likewise in all cases nothing exists in truth; and that convention and habit are the basis of everything that men do, for each thing is no more this than that\u201d\n\nThe problem is.. if you\u2019re supposed to suspend judgment on everything until you know what it is for certain\u2026how can you claim to know it is impossible to be certain? you should suspend judgment on that too. How can you know that you know nothing, if you in fact know nothing? This extreme stance is really what separates Pyrrho from the rest of the other skeptics that came in the generations after him. To be fair, some people don\u2019t even think HE thought this way\u2026 but nonetheless, as we\u2019ll see later, it was the doctrine attached to the man. It was what he represented.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s easy to get distracted by language\u2026 it\u2019s easy to spend your efforts trying to be critical of an argument written in 300 BC, but lets not forget that skepticism was a practical philosophy as well\u2026you were supposed to apply it to your life to achieve ataraxia. I think there\u2019s a lot of wisdom in skepticism\u2026there are many ways to benefit from what they talk about that don\u2019t involve lying on the ground getting surgery and choosing to not believe in pain.\n\nI want to tell you guys about someone named Jack Whitaker. Jack was a small business owner from West Virginia who was pretty successful\u2026he would walk around in a black cowboy hat\u2026a nice dress shirt\u2026a black suit coat\u2026he probably had some kind of flashy bolo tie to go with the outfit\u2026he seemed to have a loving family\u2026friends\u2026he employed people at his business\u2026he donated to charity\u2026he paid his taxes. He had a lot of good things going for him. Then, on December 25th, 2002\u2026Christmas morning\u2026he rechecks his lottery ticket from the night before and finds out that he just won the largest lottery jackpot in history at the time\u2026319 million dollars.\n\nNow at first glance this may seem like a dream come true\u2026 I mean I think it\u2019s common for people to think that the greatest thing that can ever happen to you is to win the lottery, let alone the largest lottery prize in the history of the world. And like most things that appear to be good, at first things were. He hired back a bunch of people he had to lay off a couple months before\u2026he gave a couple local pastors millions of dollars so they could build new churches\u2026he cashed his novelty sized cardboard check and started giving it out to people that were in need. But part of winning the lottery is forfeiting a certain, temporary amount of privacy. It\u2019s actually in the lottery rules that if you win the jackpot, you need to do press for the lottery office\u2026 you need to stand there with the giant check on stage and answer questions for reporters\u2026make yourself accessible to people. Well, Jack won the biggest lottery jackpot in history\u2026 and after being on TV and in the newspapers he started getting letters. A LOT of letters. It looked like that scene in Harry Potter with all the letters flying everywhere. He had so many letters from people asking him for stuff that he hired a full-time staff of people who just opened them all day long.\n\nThe Article said,\n\n\u201cThere were so many letters that they wouldn\u2019t even deliver the mail. It was nothing for us to sit for 10 hours just opening envelopes,\u201d said Jill, who asked that her last name be kept private.\n\nJill says the foundation received all kinds of requests, such as, \u201cpeople wanting new carpet, people wanting entertainment systems, people wanting Hummers, people wanting houses \u2014 just absolutely bizarre things.\u201d\n\nAnd he bought them stuff. He spent more than $50 million buying people stuff. Once everyone saw that he was giving stuff out\u2026he became like someone at the beach that gave a french fry to a seagull. People started swarming him. He said,\n\n\u201cAny place that I would go they would come up,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we went to a ballgame, a basketball game \u2026 and we must have had 150 people come up to us \u2026 and it would be going right back to asking for money.\u201d\n\nThings started going downhill fast. He was drugged and robbed while hanging out at a strip club, ironically probably giving money to the people who need help most. He was arrested for driving drunk into a concrete median a couple months later. He started getting into all kinds of trouble with the law, people filing lawsuits against him, his wife left him\u2026his family grew distant from him, he gave his granddaughter burlap sacks full of money\u2026 she became addicted to Oxycontin and eventually overdosed and died tragically young.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, Jack said that he wished he had never won the lottery. He wishes he had just torn the ticket up and never gotten any of the money. He said that winning the lottery was the worst thing that ever happened to him.\n\nJust as philosophers make judgments about what the criteria of having true knowledge is, or about what the universe is made of\u2026Just as someone in the Hellenistic Age might make judgments about whether losing their home was a bad thing or being sold into slavery\u2026 In modern times\u2026 WE make judgments about things in our everyday lives. I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone that thinks that winning the biggest lottery jackpot in the history of the world was a bad thing\u2026but this story is not unique people. Most lottery winners say that a couple years after winning the lottery they are no more happy than they were before they won the money\u2026and many of those people say they\u2019re less happy. Why?\n\nI once heard a very wise man say that if he could wish something upon his worst enemy it would be that he would be forced to get whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. That sounds crazy right? Well suspend judgment like Pyrrho for a second\u2026if you had to make an argument on the other side of the spectrum\u2026if you had to argue why that would be a terrible thing what would you say? Well this is another great example of something that seems like everyone\u2019s dream come true\u2026and it IS in the short term, but think after a year or so\u2026 if it was a curse that you couldn\u2019t lift, your life would become terrible. Think about it, so much of the satisfaction that you get out of life comes from the struggle. It comes from wanting something\u2026really bad\u2026but you cant have it. Maybe there\u2019s a car that you really want, but you cant afford it\u2026so you work hard all summer and save up for that down payment and then when you get it\u2026there\u2019s a tremendous sense of achievement and satisfaction that comes with it\u2026maybe someone tells you you cant take them out on a date\u2026and then you work hard, improve yourself and now they\u2019re interested\u2026maybe there\u2019s a scarcity of something that you want\u2026you know like a rare collectible\u2026even something as simple as needing to go to the bathroom\u2026and there are no bathrooms around\u2026so when you finally go\u2026it feels great. If every time you ever wanted something even for a split second it just appeared in front of you\u2026think of all the great feelings you would miss out on. Things would lose their value\u2026they\u2019d lose their mystique. You\u2019d never feel a sense of achievement ever again in your life. That sounds like a great thing to wish upon your worst enemy.\n\nPyrrho would have been a big fan of the saying \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\u201d. There are REAL overtones of skepticism in there. How can we know what is good in reality? How can we know we aren\u2019t just falsely attributing good to something that we think seems like it should be good? I mean you spend 8 hours a day working so you can get what you want\u2026and you don\u2019t like working\u2026so why wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to just get what you want without work\u2026its all the good and none of the bad! Skepticism applied in this practical context is similar to skepticism applied to questions in metaphysics or epistemology\u2026even the nature of things. The ground looks flat, so the earth must be flat. Take a few steps back, look at it in a more farsighted way and you see that\u2019s not the case. Pyrrho said:\n\n\u201cthings are never one way or another. impossible to measure or judge\u2026our perceptions or beliefs render neither truth or falsehood, so we should remain without belief. inclining neither this way or that\u2026so we avoid making any assertions and achieve ataraxia\u201d\n\nI remember being 16 years old and looking for a job\u2026any job. I remember I walked around for multiple hours a day for miles up and down this big long road where most of the stores were where I was living\u2026and I must have filled out a hundred applications. I wanted a job so bad\u2026I wanted to buy clothes\u2026I wanted to buy food and books\u2026I was kind of desperate\u2026and a grocery store called me in for an interview and I was really excited. I went in for the interview\u2026and the lady doing the interview instantly loved me. I was making her laugh\u2026I nailed every question\u2026it was like a scene out of a movie\u2026and at the end of the interview she looked down at the paper and said, wait a second\u2026we already hired for this position. Oh that\u2019s too bad\u2026but listen\u2026if anyone quits\u2026I\u2019m keeping your application in my desk and we\u2019re going to hire you.\n\nI felt terrible. I thought the world was ending. I couldn\u2019t imagine a worse outcome and for a week and a half I remember feeling sad thinking that I\u2019d never find a job and if I did it wouldn\u2019t be as good as that one\u2026and then another grocery store called me\u2026gave me a job\u2026and it was bagging groceries at that store that I met my current wife. Funny thing is, I\u2019m a perfect example of someone that needed to employ the ideas of skepticism.\n\nAccept your ignorance like Socrates. Admit that you know nothing. Things that seem bad are not always bad, and even if it is bad\u2026 adversity is what prepares you to navigate the future hurdles in your life. Your level of success is not determined by whether there are hurdles in your path, but by how well you can jump over them. If something bad happens to you\u2026you approach it head on, deal with it, grow and become stronger and come out the other side a better person\u2026was it still a bad thing that happened to you?\n\nPyrrho said to Suspend all judgments. Because by suspending all of them you suspend the negative ones, and by suspending them you are impervious to them. Think of all the ways this applies to you! You got fired from your job? Seems bad, but in six months you might find a job that is twice as fulfilling as your last job. Your spouse leaves you? Seems bad, but you might meet the love of your life the next day. You contract some terrible illness? Seems bad, but what if it made you exercise and think positively and build your confidence in yourself and made you appreciate every second of life after you beat it?\n\nMany of the things that made skepticism so important to Hellenistic philosophy lied in the abolition of any potential monopoly that may have formed. Pyrrho died in 270 BC, but he passed the torch to future philosophers who carried on and improved skepticism. The word skepticism comes from the Greek word \u201cskepticos\u201d which meant inquiring or searching. And skepticism became a critical philosophy, one that was centered around looking at beliefs that other people hold and looking for weaknesses\u2026inconsistencies. Are these beliefs the truth? Or is there room for doubt. If there was room for doubt, then it couldn\u2019t be true knowledge and now the people with faulty beliefs had to fix something. It\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t just about tearing other people down\u2026it was about finding the truth. Think of the four schools of the Hellenistic Age as companies that were competing for market share\u2026all providing the same general service, but appealing to a different group of people according to their own individual way of doing business. Kinda like McDonalds and KFC\u2026.they both are companies that fill the need of busy Americans to have quick, convenient, good tasting food at an affordable price, while simultaneously subtracting decades from your life. But they do things differently from each other\u2026if you\u2019re a guy that likes fried chicken more than you like hamburgers\u2026you\u2019re probably going to go to KFC. This competition between companies keeps them constantly working to get better\u2026and the worst thing that can possibly happen is a company gets a complete stranglehold of a particular market\u2026because then they have a monopoly. They grow complacent\u2026there\u2019s no incentive for them to improve themselves. Well the skeptics provided this constant competition in Hellenistic Philosophy\u2026constantly nipping at the heels of the Stoics\u2026questioning everything they said\u2026keeping them honest. If the stoics said anything that wasn\u2019t entirely substantive or based on sound logic, they would call them on it\u2026Just like if McDonalds started charging 10 bucks for a hamburger\u2026all their customers would start going to burger king. A monopoly in the corporate world is bad\u2026just imagine a monopoly of thought with no competing ideas. keeping other schools honest really was the only role of skepticism\u2026I mean if one of the central tenants of your philosophy is that it is probably impossible to ever attain certain knowledge\u2026what are you gonna write down for other people to read? Are you going to write a treatise that is two sentences long? They didn\u2019t really have much to do creatively\u2026so what they ended up doing is they spent all their time refuting what other people had to say, especially the stoics. It\u2019s interesting to think about whether stoicism would have been well developed enough to win the hearts and minds of Rome a couple centuries later if it weren\u2019t for skepticism sharpening the initial teachings of Zeno down and making them stronger. And to continue the analogy\u2026just like how companies have really smart people strategizing at the top\u2026trying to find any way to cut costs or expand or make their product or service better, all the competing schools of the Hellenistic Age ALSO had brilliant people at the top trying to improve their product.\n\nSo Pyrrho died, and he didn\u2019t write anything down\u2026let alone set up a philosophical school\u2026but his ideas lived on. Plato set up his academy\u2026and after he died in 347 BC\u2026someone e"}, "episode_10": {"date": "2014-4-29", "text": "Posted on April 29, 2014\nEpisode 14 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 14 on A Race To The Dark Ages.\u00a0\n\nFor the last several episodes we\u2019ve been talking about the Hellenistic Age. As you know by now, this was a period of uncertainty and many times chaos for the average citizen living in the Mediterranean Sea region, but the Hellenistic Age is just one segment of time that\u2019s part of a much larger whole that\u2019s known as Classical Antiquity. Classical Antiquity refers to the events in the Mediterranean Sea region\u2026 Greece, Italy, north Africa etc.. during the entire span of time from around 800 BC when the first Greek epic poems start being written to about the first few centuries AD\u2026the end is really marked by the ascendancy of Christianity and the Fall of the Roman Empire, which obviously didn\u2019t really happen in tandem or on a specific date.\n\nNow, If you\u2019ve listened to the podcast from the beginning, we\u2019ve almost covered this entire time period\u2026we started with the pre-socratics\u2026some of the earliest of them like Thales and Pythagoras living in what historians would call \u201cEarly Antiquity\u201d and we\u2019ve made it all the way to the end of the Hellenistic age\u2026a time that\u2019s sometimes called the post-hellenistic age when referring to philosophy, but historically speaking\u2026 we\u2019re moving into Late Antiquity. The events that are about to unfold\u2026right here at the end of the Hellenistic Age, both politically and philosophically, they are the reason why before you even clicked on this podcast you had heard of the names Plato and Aristotle and didn\u2019t know people like Zeno of Citium or Arcesilaus. They are the reason why people wrongly think of Epicurus as a man who was 600 lbs and had 100 girlfriends. Think of this time period\u2026.the period of time from the end of the Hellenistic age to the end of antiquity\u2026as a Race to the Dark Ages. We\u2019ve heard a lot about four schools that gained popularity during the Hellenistic age\u2026but where are the followers of Plato and Aristotle during all of this if their founders are such big names? If this time period is a race to the dark ages, then you\u2019re about to find out how Plato and Aristotle are Sea biscuit. They started out slow, but they break late. On that last straightaway\u2026some 80 lb man wearing the helmet of an English bobby is driving them to the triple crown.\n\nQuite a lot has changed in the political landscape from early antiquity to where we are now\u2026Athens used to be the cultural center of the world\u2026 or at least without question the center of the world when it comes to philosophy. You know\u2026Being a Greek city-state under the protection of the powerful Athenian Navy for a while and Alexander the Great and the most powerful army in the world for a while\u2026It allowed the philosophers living in Athens enough stability to make Athens the center of philosophy. Then, Alexander the Great died, everything descended into chaos\u2026 and all of a sudden it was a fight for control over the region. And Athens began to fall from grace when it comes to their prevalence as the sole center of the philosophical world.\n\nThere\u2019s something called a Pyrrhic victory\u2026I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s used as a colloquialism in the United States, but to be honest, I\u2019ve only heard it used a couple times. People will use it when referring to a situation where technically they won\u2026technically there was a victory here\u2026but it came at a severe cost\u2026and that severe cost makes the situation like it wasn\u2019t even a victory at all. People will use it\u2026when they\u2019re navigating the Costco parking lot\u2026 they\u2019ll be driving\u2026 dodging the people walking at a glacial pace across the street\u2026avoiding one accident after another\u2026 screaming at people\u2026 angry\u2026 narrowly avoiding the giant wheel of cheese that someone is trying to tie to the roof of their minivan.. .you\u2019re driving around for 20 minutes just looking for a spot\u2026you finally find one that\u2019s not even in the same zip code as the Costco anymore\u2026and you feel like it\u2019s a Pyrrhic victory. Because, yeah you found a spot\u2026 but at what cost? you just subtracted 2 weeks from the end of your life just navigating the parking lot\u2026you still have to walk 12 miles to the door and now you can save 30 cents on that 55 gallon drum of almonds you were going there to get.\n\nWell Athens losing their position as the sole kings of philosophy\u2026the situation they and other Greek city states went through during the Hellenistic Age\u2026is the ORIGIN of the phrase Pyrrhic victory. Part of Greece aligned themselves with a guy named Pyrrhus of Epirus\u2026a general they asked to lead an army against the Romans who were taking control of everything. Well, to Pyrrhus\u2019s credit, he won several big battles\u2026he had close to 15,000 soldiers\u2026he even borrowed some War Elephants from Ptolemy the 2nd\u2026but even despite losing, the Romans were so powerful and able to reinforce so much more quickly, that these victories ended up costing Pyrrhus the war. Plutarch gives a really great description of the quandary Pyrrhus found himself in\u2026\n\n\u201cThe armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that one more such victory would utterly undo him. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect microcosm of the Hellenistic Age as a macro. Rome made some brilliant decisions and became an unstoppable tsunami. A hundred years after Pyrrhus lost Magna Grecia\u2026Athens would be under full Roman Control.\n\nAnd now, instead of Athens being this Philosophical Oasis, now there were other places that were cultural hubs\u2026we start seeing notable philosophers appear in Alexandria and Rome. After all, if philosophy at least in some capacity reacts to the political events of the day, and a certain amount of stability is needed for people to spend their entire lives studying philosophy, then why live in Rochester, New York, why not live in New york city\u2026 Why live in western China.. .why not live in Beijing or Hongkong?\n\nYes, the four schools we\u2019ve already talked about continued to argue against each other after the Hellenistic Age. Yes, In Rome stoicism took hold and became the dominant philosophy, we\u2019ve already talked about that. But under the surface a storm was brewing. A storm that people didn\u2019t realize the significance of until it came to a climax in 300AD, right at the end of late antiquity with a guy named Plotinus and the founding of Neo-Platonism. Neo-Platonism changes everything.\n\nNow you may be saying\u2026 Neo-Platonism? Doesn\u2019t that mean new platonism? What happened to non-neo-platonism? Well, we\u2019ve already talked about Plato right? We\u2019ve already talked about the period of 75 years after Plato\u2019s death and the people that had control of the Academy expanding upon and defending positions that Plato held. Well, those people would be some of the non-neo Platonists\u2026they\u2019re known as dogmatic Platonists. Dogmatic being a word that means you lay down things to be absolutely true, in this case, the doctrines of Plato. Well, we know what comes after those guys right? The skeptical Academy. The opposite of those people\u2026these are people that questioned everything\u2026how can you know ANYTHING for certain? Well people got tired of the skeptics after a while. Philosophy as a whole started heading in a more dogmatic direction\u2026and that was most evidently seen in the return to more dogmatic Platonism. Nobody really knows for certain why philosophy started heading in this direction\u2026but it doesn\u2019t really matter\u2026and it\u2019s not like people are staring at each other clueless as to how it EVER could have happened. There are many theories\u2026and because WHY it exactly happened isn\u2019t that important\u2026I\u2019m not gonna bore you with all of them here\u2026but my personal favorite\u2026and probably the most popular of the theories is that\u2026like the rest of the culture and thought in the Hellenistic Age, people eventually started becoming disappointed with the chaotic time period they were living in and looking to the past for things from when times were better\u2026and philosophy was no exception. In this way, the Hellenistic Age served the same purpose that the Warring states period served in Eastern Philosophy when people like Confucius and Laozi looked to the past for systems of thought present when things were better.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what these Platonists were looking for. A complete system. And they recognized that Plato had a huge body of work that was compatible with these new monotheistic religions that were cropping up. There were the original Platonists\u2026the dogmatic Platonists\u2026who lived near the time of Plato.. the Neo-Platonists from 300AD onward\u2026 so these Platonists that lived after the decline of the skeptical academy\u2026and paved the way for Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists\u2026these people are known as the Middle Platonists. This is the final chapter of the Hellenistic Age even though most of it happened after the Hellenistic Age. The four schools, the cynics, the stoics, the skeptics and the epicureans are all around\u2026but this is about the rise of the last two schools\u2026making 6 in total\u2026 Neo-Platonism and Aristoteleanism.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Middle Platonists. The middle Platonists can kind of be seen as mad scientists\u2026taking the best parts from this creatures and fusing them with the best parts from this creature and making a Frankenstein monster of all the best stuff.\n\nWell that\u2019s what a lot of these Middle Platonists were doing. You start to see them become mad scientists in a way\u2026they\u2019d take THIS great idea from this philosophy and combine it with This great idea from this philosophy\u2026usually small things, because ALL of it had to be compatible with Plato. For example, From an ethical standpoint, Stoicism and Platonism actually have a lot of similarities. They actually agree on the most fundamental of ethical points back then\u2026both believe that the key to living a happy life is living a virtuous life. But they had disagreements\u2026and much like a Red Sox Fan and a Yankees fan watching sports together on Sunday\u2026they could have been friends\u2026but unfortunately they disagreed on an issue that was much more important to them: How the universe was created to begin with. See, the Stoics knew that the universe was God and that everything was formed by this conflagration of fire and air called pneuma. But a pantheistic outlook wasn\u2019t compatible with the three religious groups of the time: Paganism, Judaism and Christianity. Plato\u2019s outlook was for the most part. To explain why, I think it\u2019s best to discuss it in relation to one of the most noteworthy and brilliant of the Middle Platonists: Philo of Alexandria.\n\nFirst and foremost: Philo of Alexandria \u00a0lived in Alexandria. The city of Alexandria was named after Alexander the Great\u2026who founded it on the north coast of Africa in 331 BC and created an entirely new\u2026extraordinary kind of city. There was an island called Pharos that was about a mile offshore of Alexandria\u2026and because the Egyptian coast was too jagged for boats to be able to land consistently in the past\u2026Alexander built a giant causeway from the shore of Egypt all the way to this island which created a MASSIVE artificial harbor that connected directly to the Nile, and on this Island of Pharos, so that every ship passing in the night would know exactly where his city was\u2026 he built one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World\u2026the lighthouse of Alexandria. The city itself\u2026was magnificent\u2026Alexander embraced a lot of Egyptian culture\u2026so instead of Razing the city to the ground and building a more Greek city\u2026the people of Egypt embraced him and built these HUGE beautiful temples and monuments that are a really interesting fusion of Greek and Egyptian Architecture\u2026not only that, but they had one of the biggest and most influential libraries in all of the ancient world\u2026by the time Philo was living in Alexandria\u2026it was a busy, prosperous nexus of cultures.\n\nIf there were three main religious groups at the time, we\u2019re gonna talk about one philosopher that heavily influenced each one of them. For Judaism\u2026it was Philo of Alexandria. This isn\u2019t the same Philo that we talked about in the last episode about skepticism\u2026Philo was Jewish, but he was also a Platonist. and he spent his life trying to reconcile the two. But he didn\u2019t think there was very much to reconcile\u2026because his favorite philosopher\u2026even over Plato\u2026and in his eyes, not only the GODFATHER of all philosophy, but the greatest philosopher who ever lived, was Moses.\n\nJohn Myles Dillon was a philosopher from the 1930s and he talks about how Philo thought of Moses here,\n\n\u201cHis guiding principle was that Moses was a great philosopher (in fact, it turns out in practice, a great Middle Platonist) that all parts of his work are replete with philosophic content and are coherent and consistent with each other\u2026.How, one may ask, does Moses come to be, not just a Greek philosopher, but a full-fledged Middle Platonist? One half of this answer lies in Philo\u2019s view of the history of philosophy, which I have alluded to earlier. According to this view, Plato was a follower of Pythagoras and Pythagoras was a follower of Moses\u2026.he goes on\u2026for Philo, Moses was not only a philosopher, but the very father of philosophy, from whom all Greek thinkers take their best ideas.\u201d\n\nThink back to our Plato episode\u2026Plato was heavily influenced by Pythagoras. Philo knew this\u2026and based on evidence that later became heavily disputed, Philo ALSO thought that Pythagoras was taught and heavily influenced by the followers of Moses. Philo recognized Plato\u2019s brilliance, but really he just saw Pythagoras as an extension of Moses and Plato as an extension of Pythagoras\u2026.Plato\u2019s value was that he was a relatively modern guy that encapsulated all of this ancient wisdom incredibly well, but more importantly, he gave people new philosophical works to study\u2026i mean without Plato\u2026what would the Middle Platonists read? And other western thinkers like Aristotle and the Stoics\u2026they were just restating what Plato had already said.\n\nThese are some wild accusations\u2026 where is he coming from with all this?\n\nWell he got it from reading the philosophical works of Moses. Or at least he saw it that way. The first five books of the old testament are known as \u201cThe Torah\u201d. They are not only incredibly important to Judaism as a whole, but they are also supposed to be the writing of Moses himself\u2026you know\u2026the VERY IMPORTANT groundwork, the foundation on which your eternal fate rests\u2026 that God told Moses to\u2026.pass along to the rest of us. Well for Philo this was double awesome\u2026this was like Elvis and Justin Bieber doing a concert together\u2026he was Jewish, and he loved Moses. So he spent his life trying to interpret the torah not just as a divine proclamation on behalf of God, but as a philosophical text from the philosopher Moses. As far as Philo saw it, there was MORE to the first five books of the Bible than meets the eye. He went through it line by line writing commentary, not just interpreting what the average reader might INITIALLY think it meant, but giving an account of what he thought were OBVIOUS allegories underneath the surface purposely written by Moses.\n\nTo a modern person, it may seem obvious that you can read the bible\u2026or some other religious text\u2026and think\u2026these stories and this explanation for how it happened isnt actually how it happened\u2026but these numbers and characters symbolize other things\u2026much deeper things. Well, for people of Philo\u2019s time it wasn\u2019t obvious. In fact Philo was kind of a genius. He may be one of the reason\u2019s it\u2019s obvious to me and you.\n\nIf you look at Philo through the scope of philosophy as a whole, this is the most important thing he brings to the table. The idea that you can look at the bible\u2026you can look at these things that just seem like stories on the surface\u2026but underneath the surface there are broader philosophical overtones at work here\u2026that\u2019s huge. Philo was a pioneer in this field. Some people even think that he may be the sole reason that once Christianity became dominant in the western world, that philosophy could even exist alongside of it in even a small capacity.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of his work\u2026 we\u2019ve all heard about the story from the bible of how the earth was created in seven days\u2026now at first glance this seems like a fairy tale\u2026like\u2026how can God have a day if hes not orbiting around a sun\u2026it seems like a nice story created by ancient humans to explain things to ancient humans before they realized the implications of what day and night actually are\u2026.but if you look at this account like Philo did\u2026he said that it wasn\u2019t that it happened in 7 days\u2026that obviously doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026.he said why would an all powerful god take 7 days to do anything\u2026he did it instantly\u2026\u2026but Philo said\u2026the real significance\u2026 was that Moses was kind of speaking in code here. you know\u2026The creation story of the Bible goes on the first day god created light\u2026on the second day he separated the waters\u2026etc\u2026But Philo thought that the thing Moses said was created on each day corresponded with something else, mostly\u2026 the properties that each number inherently holds. Properties that we would later see Pythagoras talking about. Remember, the Pythagoreans thought that the number 6 was a perfect number because it was equal to the sum of all the numbers that can divide into it besides itself\u2026in this case 1, 2 and 3\u2026well Philo interpreted that the physical world was created on day 6\u2026and that perfection is why. He had one for each number\u2026he thought animals were created on day 5 because they have 5 senses\u2026\n\nHe went through the entire Torah like this\u2026verse by verse\u2026giving the interpretation that most people would have\u2026the one that is only on the surface\u2026and then the true philosophical meaning underneath the text. How the universe was created was the most important part to him\u2026 he had to find a way to reconcile his interpretation of the Bible with Plato and his story about how the universe was created\u2026he laid out his story in his famous work called the Timaeus.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been. I mean there were definitely similarities\u2026on one hand you have the book of Genesis talking about one Supreme God that has unquestionable dominion over everything and on the other hand, you have Plato\u2026who believes that the universe was created by a master craftsman\u2026 who looks to the world of forms \u2026as a pre-existing blueprint for how to make each individual thing. The best way to understand how Plato thinks the universe was made is to think of yourself as a master craftsman. Now, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m not even a mediocre craftsman, let alone a master. In fact, the only time I FEEL like a master craftsman\u2026and come to think of it\u2026the only time I ever build something from a plan\u2026is when I get something from Ikea. So bear with me here, Ikea\u2026 is the world of forms.\n\nImagine yourself as a master craftsman God\u2026walking through the aisles of Ikea\u2026and you come across some bookshelf called\u2026organblaggen or something\u2026and you buy it. Now imagine if when you\u2019re looking at that organblaggen bookshelf on the sales floor of Ikea\u2026 imagine if that was the only blueprint you had to put it together when you got home. Imagine if you had to look at the bookshelf and go home and try to make it exactly like that one. Well you probably wouldn\u2019t do it absolutely perfectly\u2026you\u2019d probably end up with half a bag full of screws\u2026you\u2019d probably end up with\u2026an inferior copy of that bookshelf. Your bookshelf is never gonna be as perfect as the one at Ikea\u2026 but it\u2019s still a bookshelf. Well in that case\u2026Ikea is the world of forms\u2026the Ikea store up in the sky with the perfect version of the end table\u2026the perfect version of the bookshelf\u2026think of the bookshelf you put together as the inferior copy of that bookshelf\u2026 or the physical world as created by the master craftsman of Plato\u2019s Timaeus.\n\nPlato thought that the world of forms exists separate from the master craftsman\u2026 and that the master craftsman creates the world using these forms as a blueprint. Philo said that the creation story in genesis wasn\u2019t talking about the creation of the earth\u2026but that Moses was laying out an explanation for the creation of the world of forms. Then he points to specific passages later on in genesis to make a case for THAT being the ACTUAL time that the physical world was created.\n\nThe importance of this is that is allows the fundamental ideas of Plato, like his world of forms and creation story, slightly tweaked\u2026to be compatible with Judaism. See Plato thought this master craftsman of his\u2026 was only that\u2026a craftsman\u2026he had these perfect forms he was seeing at Ikea\u2026the world to him was like one of those sample living rooms that they have at Ikea so you can see how things would look in the context of an entire room. He was looking at the organblaggen bookshelf\u2026next to the stuklobben nightstand\u2026next to the entertainment system\u2026and he was recreating it. But there was still some tweaking to do. Plato\u2019s account isn\u2019t very friendly with the Monotheistic outlook that God is an all-powerful supreme being that has dominion over everything\u2026his almost puts God and this world of forms on the same level. So with a very slight adjustment\u2026Philo says that God IS in fact a Supreme Being and that the forms really only exist in his mind. God can still look at these forms as a plan\u2026he just doesn\u2019t have to drive all the way down to Ikea to see the world of forms. Basically, God has a photographic memory in our Ikea example.\n\nLike what he has to say or not, I think Philo is a genius. He also manages to take the ethics laid out in the Torah and reconciles them with Plato\u2019s ethics. The idea that happiness lies not in bodily pleasures or external goods but in living virtuously is something that is touched on in not only Plato\u2019s ethics\u2026but Aristotle\u2019s ethics and Stoic ethics as well. Philo thought that all of these ethical positions are derived from the same guy\u2026Moses.\\\n\nPhilo said that the Torah strongly reinforces the idea of turning away from bodily pleasures of the body towards virtue\u2026he didn\u2019t think man actually began his existence\u2026one man..one woman in some paradise garden somewhere\u2026thought that the Garden of Eden symbolized virtue and that Adam and Eve\u2019s submission to that persuasive talking snake and the subsequent eating of the fruit\u2026ACTUALLY represents a submission to bodily pleasures and a departure from virtue.\n\nplus, as we\u2019ve seen before, the definition of what virtue is varies from philosopher to philosopher. For Philo, virtue means adherence to God.\n\nNow, if Philo of Alexandria was the Middle Platonist representing Judaism\u2026then the Middle Platonist representing Paganism was a guy named Plutarch. For anyone not familiar, to say that something is Pagan is actually a pretty vague term\u2026In modern times Paganism refers to any religion that isn\u2019t Christianity, Judaism or Islam. So back in Plutarch\u2019s time it meant a religion that wasn\u2019t Christianity or Judaism. Plutarch was born into a privileged life\u2026 his family was wealthy and successful. Plutarch\u2026didn\u2019t waste his gift. He became a priest at the local temple for the Greek god Apollo at Delphi\u2026but on top of that he became a magistrate in his home town of Chaeronea\u2026 he\u2019d travel around and represent his home at the various places where they needed a representative of his town. Despite his obvious differences from Philo of Alexandria\u2026he still dedicated the time he spent as a middle Platonist to reconciling the teachings of Plato with something perfectly compatible with modern religious beliefs.\n\nThe most notable philosophical work of his life was a clarification of Plato\u2019s creation story that allowed it to be completely in harmony with his ethics.\n\nPlutarch noticed that there were a couple lines in two completely different treatises by Plato that seem to say the opposite thing from each other. In the Timaeus\u2026Plato says that the universe was created by a master craftsman\u2026but in the Phaedrus he says that because the human soul moves around all by itself\u2026you know when you die it flies around and goes where ever it goes\u2026based on that\u2026the soul is eternal and wasn\u2019t created by anything.\n\nPlutarch clears this up by saying that Plato is talking about two completely different souls\u2026one irrational eternal soul that isn\u2019t created by anything\u2026that\u2019s in each one of us\u2026not created by the master craftsman\u2026god did create the world, but he didn\u2019t create the stuff that he makes the world out of\u2026. and because this irrational soul is part of that stuff\u2026because it isn\u2019t made by a perfect creator, its irrational\u2026however\u2026the master craftsman does make a rational soul for the entire universe\u2026and that\u2019s what he was talking about in the Timaeus\u2026 this is a view that is unique to Plutarch and its obvious that its one of those combinations of elements from multiple philosophies that we talked about earlier\u2026you know, both Plato and Aristotle and the idea of the soul having a rational and irrational part dueling against each other\u2026the stoics and the spark of the divine reason that governs all things being inherent in every one of us\u2026and obviously Plato and his Timaeus.\n\nThis irrational part of the soul is something that Plutarch refers to all the time in his philosophy. Even ethics. Things that are not virtuous appeal to the irrational part of our soul. People who are destructive or fake appeal to the irrational part of our soul. Plutarch actually had a lot to say about friendship, how to treat your friends and what makes a good friendship\u2026he actually wrote an entire book called \u201cHow to tell a Flatterer from a Friend\u201d. and it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect\u2026he lays out a comprehensive argument for what a flatterer is\u2026how to identify a flatterer vs a friend\u2026how to treat flatterers and not sacrifice your own virtue\u2026he even spends the last 12 chapters of the book talking about the proper way to talk to your friends honestly. This topic was obviously very important to him, and it makes sense.\n\nPlutarch was born into a rich family and had a prominent standing in local politics\u2026if you were someone looking to flatter someone to get some sort of selfish gain\u2026Plutarch is the exact type of person you would target. There\u2019s no doubt he dealt with tons of these people\u2026but the most interesting part is how much of it directly applies to relationships today.\n\nSo\u2026 what is the difference between a flatterer and a friend? Well to Plutarch, friends are incredibly important to our individual happiness and well being, for various reasons. For one, they bring us companionship. You know\u2026 it\u2019s good to know no matter what happens someone is always gonna be there for you. But, the most important thing\u2026the biggest value that friends have to us as far as Plutarch sees it is that they can be honest with us. I mean, think about it\u2026who else can we actually rely on to be that voice of reason for us? Who can we actually rely on to call us out when were lying to ourselves or we\u2019re being an idiot? Strangers? They might do it sometimes\u2026 but we can\u2019t rely on them for it\u2026most of them just mind their own business. Can we rely on our enemies? Of course not. Too much is at stake. We need friends. Sometimes, we need a different set of eyes other than our own to look at us\u2026no you\u2019re not going out in public in that fanny pack\u2026even if you ARE trying to be ironic. If the only things we were ever able to improve on were things that YOU were perceptive enough and honest enough to notice in yourself\u2026think of how slowly you\u2019d improve\u2026think of how little you\u2019d ever notice was wrong. Plutarch says that this is because we delude ourselves. It\u2019s even easy to flatter yourself.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must eradicate self-love and conceit, because by flattering us beforehand they render us less resistant to flatterers.\u201d\n\nYou know when you go into someones house and it smells like old food or dead animals or something? It\u2019s not like these people spray dog feces scented Febreeze or something\u2026they can\u2019t smell what you smell because they are immersed in it. A fox cant smell his own hole\u2026To them, their house just smells like air, but an objective outsider like you knows better. Just how this person isn\u2019t able to tell that something is wrong despite being around it all day long, the same thing applies to the way they behave or the way they look or the way they think. Friends offer an objective honest perspective that we can rely on, and the value of that is priceless.\n\nNow, only by understanding how important friends are can we truly understand how dangerous flatterers are to Plutarch. If the value of friends lies in their honesty and the various ways that honesty enriches our lives, then the danger of flatterers lies in their dishonesty and the various ways that dishonesty destroys our lives. But what exactly is a flatterer?\n\nPlutarch isn\u2019t scared to answer, \u201cThat last one is referring back to what we talked about before\u2026the irrational part of the soul vs the rational part of the soul. The flatterer appeals to the irrational part of the soul. Plutarch says, \u201cThe flatterer is always covertly on the watch for some emotion to pamper. Are you angry? Punish them. Do you crave anything? Buy it. Are you afraid? Flee. Are you suspicious? Give it credence.\u201d\n\nPlutarch goes on\u2026paragraph after paragraph\u2026giving an extremely detailed account of not only the common mannerisms of these flatterers\u2026but the common tactics they use to try to get what they want. He paints a picture of these people being methodical in how they find their victims\u2026they find someone that has something they want\u2026something they can give them. Keep in mind this doesn\u2019t need to be money or stuff\u2026this could be anything\u2026this could be a womanizer\u2026this could be someone that just wants a ride down to the convenience store\u2026and once these people find the person that has something they want\u2026they pretend to agree with you, as if they have similar interests and ways of thinking like your friends would.\u00a0Plutarch says,\n\n\u201cWhy should the parasite insinuate himself under that disguise? And yet he, as counterfeit gold imitates the brightness and lustre of the true, always puts on the easiness and freedom of a friend, is always pleasant and obliging, and ready to comply with the humor of his company. \u201c\n\nDid you catch that? He actually refers to these people as parasites. These people weren\u2019t just an inconvenience to Plutarch, they were toxic. A parasite by definition is an organism that lives by consuming nutrients at the expense of its host. And this really is the difference between a friend and a flatterer for Plutarch\u2026it was a question of motives. A true friend always acts in your own best interest, no matter the immediate cost to you or them. A flatterer just always tries to please you, because they want something from you. BIG difference. The other day I was reading about Hitler and the closing months of WW2\u2026 and the book I was reading was talking about how whenever one of Hitler\u2019s top generals would come to him with information or results that were bad, that bad things would happen to that person that gave him the bad news. They\u2019d get fired\u2026they\u2019d get shot\u2026something. Well, problems didn\u2019t just stop happening\u2026people just stopped telling him about them. So eventually, Hitler didn\u2019t even have the ability to fix anything, because he didn\u2019t have anyone that was willing to tell him the truth for fear of what might happen to them. Hitler, in the closing days of WW2, basically surrounded himself with flatterers, and I don\u2019t think I need to tell you guys how that worked out for him.\n\nPlutarch said \u201cThe flatterer thinks he ought to do anything to be agreeable, while the friend by always doing what he ought to do is ofttimes agreeable and sometimes disagreeable not from any desire to be disagreeable. He is like the physician who administers an unpleasant remedy.\u201d\n\nSo what should we do about these people that selfishly damage us for their own personal gain\u2026pretending to be our friends so they can get what they want, and how do we know someone is a flatterer for certain? Well Plutarch suggests a couple different courses of action, but one of the best ways to know for certain if you\u2019re dealing with a flatterer is to feign ignorance about something. Plutarch says to give him terrible advice. Advice that is supposed to be ridiculous. Pretend you are stupid. But you gotta do it with a perfectly straight face and you gotta sell it\u2026bec"}, "episode_11": {"date": "2014-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2014\nEpisode 15 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of podcast\u00a0Episode 15 on the philosophy of Plotinus.\u00a0\n\nTo me, remembering the important elements of Plotinus\u2019s philosophy and Neo-Platonism as a whole is easy to remember when thinking about it and remembering it in relation to one common question about God. It\u2019s a question that people understandably ask whenever there\u2019s any sort of major tragedy in the news or around the world, and really\u2026of all the arguments people make against the existence of a God, it\u2019s one of the most common and I think one of the weakest arguments around. How can an all powerful, loving God exist and still allow evil to exist? Or\u2026with a less narrow conception of what God is you could ask\u2026how can evil or bad things arise from a force that\u2019s entirely good\u2026one that possesses no evil to begin with? You know\u2026if we live in an ordered and harmonious Cosmos as the Greeks mostly thought\u2026and Goodness is something that seems consistent and important to whatever maintains this order and harmony\u2026then why does evil exist at all?\n\nPlotinus had a really good answer to this. Unfortunately, just explaining how Plotinus would have responded to the question when it was asked to him\u2026 isn\u2019t enough\u2026.and it\u2019s not like his entire philosophy centers around this question anyway. But what I\u2019m getting at here\u2026is if you could remember Plotinus\u2019s response to this question\u2026and why he thought it was the truth, then by remembering one question\u2026 you could use it to remember the most important contributions Plotinus and the beginning of Neo-Platonism made to philosophy as a whole. Think of ALL of Plotinus\u2019s philosophy as your entire wardrobe. This question is kind of like a walk-in closet\u2026Instead of having all your clothes in a giant pile on the floor\u2026wrinkled.. getting a shirt or a pair of pants whenever you need them\u2026you can have them neat and orderly in a walk in closet\u2026you can have your Summer beachwear over here\u2026your winter wear way over there\u2026and your old prom dresses hidden deep behind everything else\u2026you know where it is and it makes sense in relation to everything else. This question is a walk-in closet that keeps Plotinus\u2019s philosophy organized\u2026and we\u2019re going to keep referencing it throughout the episode.\n\nFirst, lets set the stage a little bit\u2026I wanna take you guys back to what it was like to live during Plotinus\u2019s time period, because by understanding that, you can understand where Plotinus is coming from.\n\nYou\u2019d find yourself in the year 250 AD. Late Antiquity\u2026Right during a period of the Roman Empire with more disaster and chaos that was out of the average citizen\u2019s control than almost any other time in the History of Rome. This time period is commonly known as the \u201ccrisis of the third century\u201d\u2026so just the name kind of gives you an idea of what is going on\u2026This is a couple hundred years AFTER the Hellenistic Age\u2026Again, another example of philosophy making huge strides during times of political and cultural unrest. Life was terrifying and difficult during this time\u2026Constant war and disease was killing the population\u2026and when it was all said and done, historians think the population was reduced by as much as 33%. and that\u2019s not all\u2026the population that survived, even in areas where no war was going on\u2026these people still had to PAY for the constant war. Taxes soared and a lot of people were forced to move somewhere else because they couldn\u2019t afford to be a citizen of Rome anymore. Imagine your modern day government demanding money from you and being forced to walk for a month in one direction to get to a place you could actually afford to live.\n\nIn fact, forget that example, just imagine yourself as someone living in Rome around the year 250 AD, during all these problems going on\u2026and you have a bone to pick with Plotinus. You just had an epiphany! You\u2019re thinking to yourself\u2026how can an all powerful God exist when there is so much evil in the world? You think it\u2019s an amazing point, and you\u2019re gonna take it to Plotinus\u2026the wisest, most highly respected philosopher sage around and say \u201clets see what he has to say about this question\u2026\u201d\n\nWell forget what Plotinus was like for a second\u2026 let\u2019s talk about you. Not only was there all this stuff going on at a political level.. but you would\u2019ve found yourself living in a world not long after a massive shift was occurring in how the average person viewed themselves as a being in this world. Or more specifically, what does it mean to be a human being\u2026what are you exactly? Think about it for a second, when you think of your \u201cself\u201d, what are you? Would you say that your body is part of who you are? Are you only a BODY? made up of only atoms in a universe that\u2019s also is made up of only atoms? Maybe you think this body of yours is just where you currently reside\u2026in this physical existence. So what are you? Are you a mind that has the ability to reason that is controlling this body? Are you like the power rangers controlling the megazord\u2026something made of physical stuff controlling something else made of physical stuff? It\u2019s not a simple question.\n\nRemember in, I believe, episode two of the podcast when I did a terrible impression of a pretentious English man asking what is philosophy\u2026and then I believe I did a terrible impression of professor snape just to flesh things out so that there was a good balance of bad spread around\u2026probably my least favorite moment in the history of the show, but i think I\u2019ve gotten a lot better since then\u2026well I\u2019d like to re-adress that question for a minute because I think it\u2019s relevant and can add something here.\n\nPeople use the word philosophy in an incredibly loose fashion. It can mean\u2026tons of stuff. Because everyone\u2019s definition of it is different, when different people tune in to a philosophy show like this one, people have different expectations of what the content is gonna be. Look, really\u2026it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. People see the word philosophy overused all around them\u2026like, Howard Schultz writes on the back of a Starbucks cup, \u201cMy philosophy is that everyone deserves a hot, delicious\u2026perfectly brewed cup of coffee\u201d but obviously that isn\u2019t what were talking about here.\n\nWe\u2019re moving into a place in the history of philosophy where it starts moving in tandem with the story of religion, most notably in the west with the monotheistic religion of Christianity.\n\nSo if were trying to figure out what philosophy is exactly, then it might be a good idea to start with what experts say it is\u2026and if you\u2019re getting a degree in philosophy from a university\u2026or you\u2019re reading an overview of philosophy\u2026Not all university curriculums cover Christianity\u2026not all book overviews see Christianity as a notable part of philosophy. Personally, I don\u2019t agree with that, I think it made several very notable ethical contributions, but I don\u2019t entirely disagree with sentiment that they aren\u2019t the same thing. I mean, why would we have two names for them if they were the exact same thing?\n\nThere\u2019s a book called A Brief History of Thought by a guy named Luc Ferry\u2026it\u2019s one of those VERY GENERAL, BROAD STROKES introductions to some of the core concepts in philosophy. It\u2019s not comprehensive, its target audience are people that have little or no experience in philosophy and it\u2019s just trying to peak your interest or give you a skeleton to work with when you\u2019re moving forward in your education. People ask me for further reading all the time over email, well here\u2019s one. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s on Audible\u2026why wouldn\u2019t it be. It\u2019s a best seller. But I\u2019d definitely recommend it, but throughout the entire book he makes the case that philosophy and religion are two very different things that try to address the same issue.\n\nHe says that we are humans. Unlike any other animal in the animal kingdom, we have the unique ability to use the pre-frontal cortex of our brain and look ahead of us and worry about what terrible things might happen to us in the future. We have the ability to look to the past and regret things that we did or may have not done. This unique ability of humans presents a very unique problem for us\u2026it causes anxiety. It causes fear. Luc Ferry makes the case that what we fear is death\u2026but his definition of death isnt a narrow definition where he\u2019s only talking about the end of our bodily existence\u2026he thinks that death is better described with the term of Irreversibility. Being humans, we worry about anything bad that might happen to us where existence wont be the same anymore. you worry about your arm getting ripped off by a passing train or bus\u2026you might worry about your girlfriend leaving you\u2026and then you\u2019re just gonna be looking back on \u201cthe one that got away\u201d for the rest of your life\u2026we fear irreversibility. Well, both religion and philosophy give us relief from this fear. Religion makes the claim that death is an illusion\u2026and there\u2019s all different ways the various religions put this, but most of them say that death is just the end of this obstacle course that we\u2019re in and then TRUE existence begins or re-begins\u2026in some higher realm.\n\nWhen seemingly bad things happen, Christianity would say that it\u2019s all part of the providential plan of God, so you shouldn\u2019t worry about it, God is sending you a message through this experience.\n\nLuc Ferry says that philosophy, on the other hand, is \u201csalvation without religion\u201d. He thinks that philosophy is a way to look at yourself objectively and overcome this fear of death and irreversibility using only the mechanisms given to you as a homo sapien living on planet earth. You don\u2019t need a supernatural God that tells you that death is actually something really great to overcome it, you can come to peace with death ALL on your own. So far, we\u2019ve seen a lot of examples of this\u2026we have the epicureans saying that there\u2019s no reason to fear death because all you are is a collection of atoms that will simply cease to exist\u2026we have the stoics and the Buddhists saying very similar things about the fact that if you were to be killed or bad things were to happen, they are external to you and completely out of your control so there is no reason to worry about it.\n\nReal quick, you may wonder why things like physics and metaphysics are important in philosophy if you think this way\u2026well, to know the best or wisest way to act in any one situation, one very important piece of information you need is to know where you are. I mean, the proper way to act in the library is completely different than the proper way to act in a night club\u2026or a bowling alley. Luc Ferry says that we can think of physics and metaphysics as just a way of understanding exactly where we are, so that we can make further inferences.\n\nNow if you think about it this way, then philosophy and religion are obviously VERY different from each other. There are exceptions to this RULE that he\u2019s laid out\u2026but by and large it is a really good way to categorize information in philosophy. This is the idea behind why many university curriculums and books don\u2019t consider Christianity or other religions as philosophy. And really, can I just say that as a nice man that wants nothing but to entertain and empower people with my voice, the idea of doing an episode solely on Christianity is a recurring nightmare that I wake up to. Christianity back in the times of Jesus and then the Roman Empire was MUCH different than Christianity is today. Plus, because it effects SO MANY people still, there are ALL KINDS of different interpretations of what happened, how it happened, how Christianity made its ascendancy and its relation with government. It\u2019s an absolute nightmare\u2026its just ASKING for people to be offended\u2026or for people to defensively offer up another interpretation. The religion itself is a pretty big part of philosophy over the years, and we WILL have episodes on philosophers, who were christian, that looked at the tenets of Christianity through the lens of philosophy. But to do an episode on the FOUNDING of the religion, not really relevant and not really a good idea.\n\nJust think about any other story we have during this time period or before. I mean just to give an example\u2026we talked about Seneca in our episode on stoic ethics. He lived a generation AFTER when Jesus would have walked the earth\u2026he was supposedly an important public official\u2026adviser to the Emperor Nero\u2026and we don\u2019t even know for sure that he existed. The signs point to yes, but there is uncertainty\u2026Many people think that his writings may be two or three different people just attributed to one guy they call Seneca.\n\nJust think about the magical and crazy stories we\u2019ve heard about people like Pyrrho\u2026or Pythagoras\u2026.i mean, today we\u2019re going to talk about Plotinus who lived in TWO HUNDRED AD\u2026and there are all kinds of stories of him summoning spirits and countering a magicians spells\u2026we\u2019re supposed to immediately discount these stories as though they\u2019re completely untrue and accept the miracles that Jesus performed as fulfillment of prophecy. The point i\u2019m trying to make is that ALL the sourcing from this time period is shaky and up for dispute, and as a podcast host I don\u2019t think it would be fair to do a show on the founding of Christianity anyway.\n\nOne thing you cannot dispute is the HUGE surge in the popularity of Christianity, and really it was in line with that SHIFTING of how the average person of the time viewed themselves. Remember, what am I exactly? There were tons of answers to this question that came before this time period of 250 AD\u2026.I mean, pretty much every Greek Philosopher before had something to say on the matter\u2026.and really\u2026they all had the same amount of real evidence to make these claims about what we were\u2026they had nothing. Well now, there was a NEW thought pattern growing in popularity. People decided that they weren\u2019t a body or a mind\u2026they thought they were just a consciousness that controls a body in this physical world.\n\nHumans decided what they truly were was something that closely resembled a spiritual being\u2026not just a spiritual being\u2026but an imprisoned spiritual being\u2026 confined, chained to bodies in this physical realm. Your body belongs to you, but it isn\u2019t you. Kind of like your smart phone\u2026it belongs to you\u2026it is instrumental in how you go about your everyday existence\u2026but your smart phone isn\u2019t YOU.\n\nYour true self is just a consciousness that controls this body. It\u2019s important to note that when all these other Greek Philosophers were talking about souls\u2026 there were no implications necessarily of this soul traveling to some spirit world after you were dead\u2026 there very sporadic instances where they mentioned an afterlife of some sort\u2026 but for the vast majority of them, the soul was completely compatible with the physical world, many times as much a part of your body as your hands or feet were. If your hands were the part of your body that held things\u2026 or touched things\u2026 then the soul was just the part of your body that\u2026reasoned\u2026or felt emotions\u2026 or a number of different other things depending on which philosopher was speaking at the time.\n\nJust imagine for a second if you felt that way. The people back then, more and more, began to see themselves as a consciousness\u2026 trapped in a flawed physical body\u2026 existing in this flawed physical realm that brings you suffering\u2026 just dying to return to REAL existence in this higher realm that has nothing to do with the physical world.\n\nJust imagine feeling that way. You\u2019re basically the main character in the movie planet of the apes\u2026you crash land on an alien planet\u2026actually\u2026spoiler alert\u2026you crash land on what you THINK is an alien planet\u2026your ship is destroyed\u2026you need to replace some parts or find a new ship so you can get off the planet and return to your true existence\u2026but in the meantime\u2026you\u2019re trapped on this hostile alien world\u2026just trying to make the best of it.\n\nThat would\u2019ve been your reality. That would\u2019ve been Plotinus\u2019s reality. So what started to happen is people started looking for a way to get some relief from this \u201creality\u201d as they saw it, and not to mention the anxiety of death and all the other problems that face you as a human in this world\u2026and there were several narratives that gained popularity during the time to try to achieve that sense of relief. You saw Eastern philosophy start to gain in popularity in the West a bit during this time\u2026There were several pagan approaches\u2026but none of these caught much steam because they didn\u2019t immediately improve the lives of the people following them like Christianity did. Plus, Christianity offered a personalized salvation, it was very appealing to people worried about their own mortality.\n\nThe most important thing we should understand RIGHT NOW\u2026 is that during this time that Plotinus lived there were various attempts at creating a system that would help people cope with this new idea of what exactly being a human is. Most commonly, this was done by creating a distinction between existence in this physical world\u2026and what they called TRUE existence\u2026 you know\u2026 turning away from our bodily existence\u2026and towards a higher realm of existence. Neo-Platonism was one of them.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to our example. You\u2019re living during this time, you see yourself as this consciousness that\u2019s trapped in this inferior physical realm\u2026.you have this great idea pointing out how God can\u2019t exist because there is evil in the world and you want to talk to Plotinus. Well based on the stories that we have about him\u2026it\u2019s pretty clear that Plotinus was a pretty interesting guy\u2026he\u2019s alive a little too late to have super extreme stories about him where he\u2019s practically a god himself\u2026he has kind of a lessened version of the treatment people like Pythagoras got\u2026it\u2019s not as extreme\u2026he ends up sounding a little less like Pythagoras and a little more like the ruler of North Korea\u2026you know he gets stories like \u201che invented the game of basketball and scored 500 points in his first game playing\u201d There\u2019s a story of Plotinus when he\u2019s fairly young and one of his fellow classmates got really jealous of him and cast a spell on him\u2026he was like an evil magician\u2026and Plotinus gets hit with the spell and his body gets all stiff, but because Plotinus had such a powerful spirit protecting him\u2026the spell bounced off of him and was reflected back onto the person that cast it. Basically, replace the entire opening sequence of the Harry Potter books or movies with this section of Plotinus\u2019s life\u2026I mean come on\u2026his mom\u2019s love protected him\u2026Voldemort\u2019s spell was reflected and then he had to get geriatric care for the next 15 years\u2026I\u2019m just saying lets not COMPLETELY rule out that JK Rowling stole this story from Plotinus.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is\u2026we have a very limited number of stories about Plotinus to work with\u2026and these kinds of stories recur over and over again. He was seen as a sage in his time\u2026he didn\u2019t eat very much\u2026he didn\u2019t sleep very much\u2026he was breastfed until the age of 8\u2026and it\u2019s clear that there was at least some sort of reason to believe that he had these sage like qualities and powers because he had a level of transcendent knowledge. He had encountered something intellectually that made him\u2026different from everyone else. He had achieved that sense of relief that everyone was looking for. And it\u2019s not like he just didn\u2019t experience the feeling of being trapped on an alien planet like everyone else\u2026he felt that too\u2026there\u2019s a story of someone wanting to make some kind of likeness for him to be remembered by. You know they wanted to make a painting of him\u2026and he turns to the guy and says:\n\n\u201cIs it not enough to have to carry around this image? Must I transmit the image of this image as worthy of attention?\u201d\n\nWhat he meant here is that this body that he inhabits in this physical world\u2026this isn\u2019t the highest form of existence\u2026this body that he\u2019s in is already just an inferior copy\u2026it\u2019s just an image. Why should he have a picture painted of this false image\u2026it\u2019s just an inferior copy of an inferior copy. It\u2019s like taking a Polaroid picture of a Polaroid picture. Whats the point?\n\nPlotinus was highly respected. And if you asked him\u2026How can a God exist who is good and powerful and still allow evil to exist in the world? How can that possibly be the case? He would say that it\u2019s because EVIL does not exist. At least in the way YOU think about it, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nSee, Plotinus would have heard your question and said:\n\n\u201chow does evil exist in the world? that\u2019s easy\u2026i\u2019ll do you one better\u2026how does ANYTHING bad exist in the world at all?\u201d\n\nNot just\u2026why does God allow serial killers to exist\u2026but also, why are people born with birth defects? why do people get cancer? Things like that. Really, Plotinus doesn\u2019t HAVE to challenge you here, but the word he used for evil in greek is better translated in modern times to anything \u201cbad\u201d\u2026so just go with it.\n\nHe would say that the reason why you\u2019re so confused about evil existing is because you\u2019re looking at it the wrong way. When bad things exist in the world\u2026when evil things happen\u2026that isn\u2019t a presence of evil or badness\u2026that is an ABSENCE of goodness.\n\nBecause no matter what it is\u2026if something commits an evil act or has qualities that are bad\u2026those qualities or acts can only exist IN RELATION to something good. We used a Harry Potter example earlier\u2026well Lord Voldemort\u2026we\u2019ve all seen the depiction of him in the movies\u2026he certainly commits his fair share of evil acts\u2026but he wouldn\u2019t be able to commit any of them if he didn\u2019t have a certain level of\u2026virility. He has a GOOD body\u2026not a good body like an Abercrombie and Fitch model\u2026his body\u2026is good. He has good enough health and mobility to chase harry potter around and try to do evil stuff. You cant be an evil dictator on the level of a Lord Voldemort on a hover-round. alright? And there are other examples on Lord Voldemort\u2026he doesn\u2019t really have a nose. Well, at least not like a normal person. It looks like he lost it in a construction accident\u2026but the couple slits that he does have\u2026if we call that his NOSE then it still allows him to breathe. If a good nose is one that performs the functions of a nose well, then there is at least SOME good present in relation to his BAD nose. If there wasn\u2019t, then the nose wouldn\u2019t exist, and he would be dead. Everything evil or bad really should be thought of as goodness not being as good as it has the potential to be. Because if something was COMPLETELY devoid of ANY good qualities\u2026it would not and COULD NOT exist. The physical matter things are made of also plays a big role and a little later, we\u2019ll talk about how matter works into all this.\n\nThe genius of this lies in saying the same thing in a different way. If you took away the good of something\u2026then the bad is always taken away with it. So bad only exists in relation to good, and is therefore just an absence of good.\n\nAnd this begs the question of why there should even be an absence in the first place. Well this is the crossroads that can explained by the rest of Plotinus\u2019s philosophy. This is a convenient pivot point\u2026because by explaining that absence of good, we thereby explain his largest contribution to philosophy and the philosophical system that allowed him to get relief from being trapped on an alien planet.\n\nSee, this alien planet is the physical world. And Plotinus\u2019s philosophy begins with asking what seems like kind of a weird question\u2026How do we tell when something is something\u2026What is a quality that everything that is something has? Well to answer this question, Plotinus looks at a lot of different individual things\u2026\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cIt is in virtue of unity that beings are beings. This is equally true of things whose existence is primal and of all that are in any degree to be numbered among beings. What could exist at all except as one thing? Deprived of unity, a thing ceases to be what it is called: no army unless as a unity: a chorus, a flock, must be one thing. Even house and ship demand unity, one house, one ship; unity gone, neither remains\u2026 thus even continuous magnitudes could not exist without an inherent unity; break them apart and their very being is altered in the measure of the breach of unity.\u201d\n\nSo in case you didn\u2019t catch it, Plotinus says that every thing has a certain amount of unity. In order to be considered a being\u2026you need to possess a certain amount of unity. I mean, what makes a marching band ONE marching band? Why isn\u2019t it just a bunch of individual people in really weird costumes that specialize in playing various different instruments? There is a quality of UNITY that makes them ONE marching band. If you remember our last episode, when we compared the world of forms to IKEA, what makes the bookshelf a bookshelf as opposed to all the different parts that you get when you open the box when you get home?On that same note, what makes a clock a clock, instead of just being a bunch of different individual cogs and levers? Plotinus says what all these things have in common is that they possess unity, but they all don\u2019t have the same amount of unity. The level of unity something has comes down to the idea that Aristotle lays out in his four causes\u2026and if you remember, one of those four causes is the efficient cause, which the vast majority of the time is just the cause of the thing\u2019s existence. What brought this thing into being? Well, the efficient cause of a clock is much different than the efficient cause of a dog. I mean, humans artificially created that clock\u2019s unity\u2026living things like dogs have a unity that is inherent\u2026they were born with it. Plotinus says that something like a dog has a greater amount of unity than something like a clock.\n\nAnd marching bands\u2026they have less unity than either of these things\u2026for obvious reasons.\n\nFollowing this line of reasoning, Plotinus says that the more unity something has\u2026the more real it is. Well, we\u2019ve already talked about this concept of reality not existing in this physical world\u2026this bodily existence\u2026and that our true existence lies in a higher realm that were hoping to return to one day\u2026and for the record, this is compatible with huge concepts that Plato talked about\u2026remember his allegory of the cave that reality as we see it can be thought of as just shadows on a cave wall. Well those shadows on the cave wall that we see in our bodily existence\u2026the inferior copies of the true forms of everything\u2026this alien planet was what almost every single piece of Greek Philosophy before Plotinus tried to make us feel better about. We can look at the philosophy of this time period as just a means to an end of relieving the suffering of the physical world WITHIN the physical world\u2026Greek philosophy that came before focused on achieving happiness in this physical world\u2026but Plotinus tells us to turn away from our bodily existence and towards a higher realm where our true reality is\u2026and this idea of unity is extremely important.\n\nThis is the part we NEED to remember for future catholic philosophy. THE MOST important part of Plotinus\u2019s philosophy is called his \u201cchain of being\u201d sometimes referred to as his \u201chierarchy of being\u201d. Its kind of how it sounds\u2026its a hierarchical system\u2026The most common visual people use to describe the way Plotinus looked at existence, and one that I think is really good, is by thinking of it as a multi-tiered fountain. You\u2019ve seen one before where the water spouts out of the top tier and it overflows into the next tier until it overflows into the third tier and so on and so forth\u2026Well, think of Plotinus\u2019s philosophy as a three tiered fountain. At the very top\u2026the TOP TIER OF THIS FOUNTAIN\u2026is Unity. Plotinus sometimes calls it, \u201cThe One\u201d he sometimes calls it \u201cthe good\u201d as a harkening back to Plato..many people call it \u201cGod\u201d\u2026but I cant call it anything. Nobody should really call it anything. You know how the first rule of fight club is that you cant talk about fight club? Well, the first rule of \u201cthe one\u201d is that you cant talk about the one. It is beyond description. The second you try to categorize it with words and call it something, you\u2019re already wrong. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t such a huge part of his philosophy, I wouldn\u2019t have even brought it up. See, my only skill is to categorize things and make them relatable\u2026but Plotinus has found my kriptonite. In fact, the best way for me to even convey what it is in an inaccurate way is to compare it to the second and third tiers of the fountain, so let me just tell you what all three tiers are and then ill explain how they relate to each other. The top tier is \u201cthe one\u201d, the second tier is \u201cthe intellect\u201d, and the bottom tier is the soul which creates the physical world that we live in.\n\nSo, things exist in this physical world. Right? They all possess different amounts of unity. And much like Plato talked about in his allegory of the cave and his world of forms\u2026we can study things like\u2026TREES in this physical world. We can see a million trees and write down all the characteristics about them, but we will never find the PERFECT form of a tree\u2026and part of the reason for that is\u2026what is tree-e-ness? it isn\u2019t roundness\u2026or if it\u2019s a pine tree\u2026it isn\u2019t the ESSENCE of being \u201cGreen\u201d\u2026It\u2019s JUST TREE-E-NESS. But we can never find that here in the physical world. No matter how hard you look, it will always have other forms in relation to it\u2026green-ness and roundness for example. But the perfect form of tree-e-ness MUST exist somewhere\u2026even if it\u2019s only in thought. As we all know by now, this PLACE where these things exist is called the world of forms. Well that perfect form of tree-e-ness in the world of forms is the most unified, perfect version of a tree\u2026and if the more unified something is the more real it is, as Plotinus thought, then that tree, even if it only exists through intellectual thought\u2026is more real than any of these flawed shadows on the cave wall of the physical world.\n\nThis is why the second tier of the fountain is called the intellect. This is the world of forms. This is where true existence lies. We are souls that inhabit a physical body. Sure, it may seem like we exist in the sense-able world\u2026you know the world that we can sense with our sense organs, but TRUE existence is in the intellect.\n\nJust because trees in the physical world LOOK like trees, doesn\u2019t mean they ARE trees. Plotinus thought of things in the physical world as more of NON-being than Being\u2026because true being\u2026the unified, pure forms of everything existed in tier 2\u2026the intellect. These physical non-beings were shadows on the cave wall, or as Plotinus saw it, reflections of the forms from tier 2\u2026cast by the soul\u2026into FLAWED, terrible matter that distorts and dilutes everything\u2026and that\u2019s the world we live in. The soul is tier three. That is the function of the soul to Plotinus, to create and organize the physical world by being a catalyst between the world of forms and this crude physical matter that ruins everything. To Plotinus there was a rational soul given to humans that was a little different\u2026 and a world soul that did it for\u2026 everything else. To Plotinus, humans were really just pure intellects with an individual soul. He thought the purpose of an intellect\u2026was to think\u2026and try to gain understanding about the world of forms. Yeah we have all these emotions and ambitions and desires but really, those don\u2019t make up what it means to be \u201cme\u201d \u2026 those are just as much a part of us as our physical bodies are. OUR true existence, and the true existence of most things for that matter lied in tier two\u2026the intellect. So because of all that, Plotinus concludes that the goal of philosophy, and really what we should all be doing, given that we are an intellect, we should turn away from this bodily existence and towards reality by contemplating and trying to understand the forms and then eventually we will find out how fake the physical world is and that actually always connected to true existence, or tier 2.\n\nBut in this tier 2, in the world of forms, there exists a perfect form of everything. Again, if we think about it as IKEA, there is a perfect form of a bookshelf, the perfect form of the end table\u2026the perfect form of the night stand\u2026but even all of these things have one thing in common. they are all a single unified being, in themselves. that\u2019s the unity that we talked about\u2026and because of this Plotinus thinks they must all rely on something even greater than them\u2026something whose entire being is that unity\u2026that oneness\u2026.something that gives rise to everything. That is the first tier. The One\u2026The Good\u2026God\u2026whatever you want to call it.\n\nThrough lots of imagery and storytelling Plotinus says that the One overflows and gives rise to The intellect and that the intellect overflows and gives rise to the soul which then shines reflections of these perfect forms into the terrible physical matter that makes up the sense-able wo"}, "episode_12": {"date": "2014-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2014\nEpisode 16 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of podcast\u00a0Episode 16 on the philosophy of Saint Augustine.\n\nOne of my favorite things to ask people and, to me, one of the most fascinating things to hear people talk about is the moment they knew they had found the infallible truth about life and the infinitely enormous universe that we live in. There is usually a moment in their life\u2026it\u2019s a little like the JFK assassination\u2026or 9/11\u2026everybody knows where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news\u2026well I think being one of the lucky few that has the nature of existence revealed to them has to rank AT LEAST as high as those events. I mean, it\u2019s pretty huge! People have ALL different ways that this happens to them. For whatever reason, they\u2019re chosen out of the 7 billion people and growing on this planet for God to breach the strict protocol of never revealing himself so that he can have some kind of direct correspondence with them. You know, he\u2019ll directly speak with them sometimes, people talk about having conversations with god\u2026maybe sometimes hes not really in a talking mood so he does something like\u2026move the drapes and then the person infers that God moved the drapes, so that means I have to go outside\u2026but not physically outside\u2026he means outside this BOX I\u2019m living in\u2026this box of sin and deceit. A couple Mormons that came to my door one time said that the moment THEY knew WAS direct communication, but it was more in the form of God giving them certain feeling states when they think about big decisions in their life\u2026or by giving them goosebumps\u2026the all powerful creator of the universe was communicating with them by making their hair stand up on end. Another one of these interesting examples\u2026 One of my many step grandmothers over the years once told me a story\u2026apparently one day her cat, who was SEVERELY overweight somehow got the\u2026you know those ventilation grates in the floor that you can have in a two story house? well apparently she forgot to put it back covering the hole in the ground one time and her morbidly obese cat went down inside of the ventilation shaft and got stuck\u2026like he got wedged in there\u2026it was like some parody of mission impossible 7\u2026 Tom Cruise gains 50 pounds and has one last go at trying to save the world but its not working out for him too well. Anyway so my step grandma hears the cat meowing and she goes to the kitchen where she keeps her bible, because who doesn\u2019t like to cook and study the word simultaneously\u2026 and she begins praying\u2026 and all of a sudden and when she tells this story she is incredibly emotional, so she obviously believes that it happened\u2026 or it DID happen\u2026 GOLDEN TUBES OF LIGHT RAIN DOWN FROM THE SKY\u2026 there was a chorus of angels\u2026she told me she actually saw heaven and Jesus descended from the ceiling right through the ventilation shaft and he said \u201cUSE THE STEPLADDER\u201d granted when she tells the story he doesn\u2019t say it like he\u2019s a genie\u2026 he says it in a comforting voice\u2026then he disappears and she goes and gets her mom, because she was young at the time\u2026 and they use the step ladder to reach up into the ventilation system from downstairs and they manage to get the cat out. and how lovely is that you guys? Jesus HAS to be busy\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of tragedy in the world\u2026i read once that something like 100 people die EVERY SECOND\u2026 many of which from preventable diseases or violent acts\u2026i mean i cant fathom how special it must feel to be the cat he saved instead of dealing with the rest of the 7 billion pieces in the chess game he is playing all over the world. To my ex-step grandmother it was a miracle, and she said from that moment on there has never been any doubt, she and god have conversations all the time and she knows that if anything bad ever happens to her, God is going to get her out of it. Well I love hearing these stories\u2026 and the guy were gonna talk about today has a really great one, albeit not as sensational as my ex-step grandmas\u2026 and its a great story\u2026 because he spent SO MUCH of his life as a skeptic of Christianity and then he has this experience and he is INSTANTLY certain of everything\u2026he INSTANTLY knows the infallible truth. Can you guys REALLY blame me for being so interested in these stories? I mean if you start with the knowledge we are born with\u2026its pretty incredible that ONE experience not only tells you that a supernatural God exists\u2026 but that THAT god is a single god\u2026that is interested in human affairs and offers people personal salvation if they follow his set of rules\u2026 but not only that\u2026ALSO that this supernatural god manifested himself on planet earth and sacrificed himself, to himself to save us from himself or however the popular saying goes if were talking about Christianity. I mean these things are not just a given when you\u2019re born into this world, and I find it endlessly fascinating to hear when others are given experiences like this.\n\nNow, Saint Augustine was one of these lucky few\u2026 and if you\u2019re looking at figures in the history of philosophy\u2026 he kind of gets a bad rap\u2026 he\u2019s sometimes portrayed as the \u201cmommas boy\u201d of philosophy\u2026but I think that\u2019s kind of inaccurate and really its just trying to point out that his mom was a semi famous figure herself. you guys would know her better as Saint Monica..the town of Santa Monica in Southern California is named after her\u2026its easy to imagine being a child and feeling an enormous amount of pressure to conform to the same religious beliefs as your parents and fearing that if you don\u2019t you wont be accepted by them\u2026plus if its a RULE in their house that you\u2019re GOING to go to church every Sunday if you\u2019re living under my roof\u2026your choice as a child becomes either to believe and to become a Christian\u2026 or to be COMPLETELY antisocial and against all these people at all the various church functions\u2026 people who are usually INCREDIBLY nice and worthy of respect. My point is\u2026this is a modern example of how someone might feel pressure from their parents and family to believe in something and it might lead them to accept the first thing that is presented to them and work out all the details later simply by virtue of this peer pressure. Well one AMAZING thing about Saint Augustine is that he DIDNT do that, he remained unsure for many of his formative years\u2026 and he did it in the face of Saint Monica. Much of the reason this woman is heralded by the roman catholic church is because of how persistent and effective she was at leading her son to Christianity. For her son to remain skeptical for as long as he did tells us a great deal about Saint Augustine and it makes the story he tells of the moment when he converted especially interesting. But first let me tell you a little bit about his early life because it ends up shaping his philosophy for years to come.\n\nSaint Augustine was born in a town called Thagaste\u2026 it\u2019s on the coast of North Africa and instantly he found himself in an environment of religious differences and conflict. But I\u2019m not talking about the world and society he was born into which without a doubt WAS full of differences and conflicts\u2026I\u2019m talking about his home life. His father was a pagan\u2026his mother was a devout Christian. Their two backgrounds made for two very different ideas of what the best path was for young Augustine. When you read Saint Augustine\u2019s principal work called \u2026\u201dconfessions\u201d \u2026 ALL throughout the dozens of books and volumes a recurring theme is him lambasting himself for all the TERRIBLE sins he committed as a youth. The funny part is\u2026 it\u2019s not like he was some sick\u2026sadistic kid\u2026you know it wasn\u2019t like he was that kid that lived next door in Toy Story. He seems pretty normal. But this guilt consumes him\u2026and it would consume you too if you believed like he did that you are held accountable for every sin you commit from the moment you are born\u2026 even ones you commit when you are just an infant\u2026\u00a0he says this in the confessions:\n\n\u201cWho can recall to me the sins I committed as a baby? For in your sight no man is free from sin, not even a child who has lived only one day on earth.\u201d\n\nRight here, you can see the disconnect from how we in modern times typically think about the actions of babies and things we do in early childhood. Generally speaking\u2026 as a society\u2026 the earlier in life you do something the less accountable you are for your actions\u2026or at least the more we expect you to make mistakes so therefore the punishments are less\u2026 I mean this is why if an 8 year old kills someone they get 2 years in Juvi and if a 28 year old kills someone its 25 to life. But for Saint Augustine, from the time we set foot on terra firma for the first time were getting tried as adults. and he\u2019s not just vilifying everyone else for the sins they committed as children and babies\u2026 like I said before\u2026 he spends huge chunks of entire books reading HIMSELF the riot act about all the bad things he used to do\u2026he talks about his unquenchable desire for his mother\u2019s milk as though he\u2019s committing the sin of gluttony\u2026 he talks about all the needless and ungrateful COMPLAINING he did all the time just crying whenever he needed something. The deeper implication here, one that even adults can take something from\u2026 is that if we do something wrong and we didn\u2019t know that it was wrong\u2026that doesn\u2019t SAVE us from God\u2019s wrath. Plus, this sets a very useful precedent that regardless of how seemingly perfect your life has been from the moment when you were able to be mindful of your actions\u2026you are still a sinner that needs God to save you from the lake of fire.\n\nIn other words, no matter who you are or what age you are, you are flawed and in need of God\u2019s grace to save you from your inevitable fate in Hell. This is what his mother Monica was telling him all throughout his childhood. And yet, he STILL remained skeptical. Luckily for him, his father saved up enough money to get him out of the house and be educated. But he was still a young man\u2026a young man setting sail\u2026making the philosophy scene\u2026you know\u2026hes a blank slate out there experiencing the world. Years later in his Confessions he would write about one of these places he went in his early life:\n\n\u201cI went to Carthage, where I found myself in the midst of a hissing cauldron of lust. Bodily desire, like a morass, and adolescent sex welling up within me exuded mists which clouded over and obscured my heart, so that I could not distinguish the clear light of true love from the murk of lust.\u201d\n\nHe goes on later:\n\n\u201cThis was the age at which the frenzy gripped me and I surrendered myself entirely to lust, which your law forbids but human hearts are not ashamed to sanction.\u201d\n\nSo, we can see several things here that are quintessential qualities of Saint Augustine. Most notably in my opinion is that its a not-so-distant relative of the idea that Plato, Plotinus and other philosophers laid out that there is a clear distinction between existence in the sense-able world and existence in a higher, more real world. It\u2019s drawing a distinct line in the sand between pleasures within our bodily existence and what he sees as the truth, our soul\u2019s eternal fate. His example is the difference between \u201cthe clear light of true love from the murk of lust\u201d\n\nIt seems clear that he made some mistakes during his younger years when it came to lust. He sure talks about it enough\u2026honestly he attacks himself so relentlessly and with such severity that the deeper philosophical implications under what hes saying can kind of get lost underneath the paragraph after paragraph of him telling himself he didn\u2019t follow the Christian rulebook well enough. But earlier on in the confessions he makes a point that illustrate what I think he was trying to get at in the next several chapters, he said:\n\n\u201cBut my sin was this, that I looked for pleasure, beauty, and truth not in him but in myself and his other creatures, and the search led me instead to pain, confusion, and error. \u201c\n\nSo while he is out, getting educated, seeing the world, he finds what HE thinks is the truth. He became a believer in Manichaeism. Manichaeism was a Gnostic religion that was a pretty serious rival to Christianity during the times of Saint Augustine: basically the idea behind it was that God wasn\u2019t all powerful, and that in actuality everything is controlled by a dualistic cosmos. In the case of Manichaeism there were two forces, Good and Evil constantly battling against each other and it should be known that these two forces in themselves are extremely complex and represent things\u2026 many times the Good representing the spiritual or higher existence and the Evil representing the material flawed lower existence. The important part is this, Saint Augustine became a follower of Manichaeism. Sometimes I like to think about how things would have played out if little sputnik moments throughout history ending up happening differently. Just imagine if instead of Christianity becoming the dominant religion of the west if Manichaeism tipped the scales in their favor. How would the world be different today? It\u2019s interesting to think about people walking around believing that there is a powerful cosmic force of Good perpetually battling with a powerful cosmic force of evil and we, as humans, are co-existing with this battle. It\u2019s interesting to think about. But really, the great thing about Christianity is that it kind of has everything. There are Christians today who believe in something very similar\u2026they believe that the devil exists and has the power to intervene and try to influence humans into doing his bidding\u2026you know the devil tries to get us to do bad stuff and God tries to give us strength so that we wont succumb to his temptations. The similarities to Manichaeism are obvious.\n\nBut anyway, after a while of following Manichaeism he grew kind of suspicious. He started having questions that people couldn\u2019t answer\u2026 and ultimately he just wasn\u2019t satisfied. He started talking to Archbishop Ambrose and he started leaning more in the direction of Christianity. But he wasn\u2019t sold yet. He wanted to be\u2026but I imagine he would\u2019ve felt a little silly just hopping from one religion which he says is the absolute truth directly to another one\u2026he needed some sort of experience to make him sure.\nSo the story goes that Saint Augustine was having a conversation with someone and gets incredibly frustrated with himself\u2026 so like someone who has attended therapy in his life\u2026he removes himself from the discussion and goes out to his garden to cool down and get some fresh air. But he doesn\u2019t cool down. In fact, he starts hitting himself\u2026 he starts pulling his own hair out\u2026 he starts crying.\n\nNow as he\u2019s sitting there crying on a bench, he hears a child say from a nearby house the words \u201cpick up and read, pick up and read\u201d. At first he thinks it is just the kids playing a game\u2026 but then he realizes it was a divine intervention. God had taken control of that child\u2019s brain\u2026or at least orchestrated events in that child\u2019s life so that he KNEW she would yell those words at that time and that they would echo across the garden and Augustine would be there crying and HE would take those words and interpret them as a message from god to read his Bible. God is smart, you guys. He was ten steps ahead of them\u2026 as feeble humans they got played by God. It almost calls into question our ability to exercise free will if our actions are so predictable or God has the ability to seize control over your actions.\n\nSo Augustine gets the message from God and decides that what he should \u201cpick up and read\u201d is the Bible\u2026so he get\u2019s his Bible, opens it up and the first line that he reads is Romans 13 verse 13 and 14:\n\n\u201cLet us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.\u201d\n\nWell to someone whose mom had told him all throughout his childhood how flawed he was and how wrong all of these earthly desires were\u2026 the kind of upbringing that would lead Saint Augustine to think so terribly of his time in Carthage as a young man\u2026 the type of upbringing that would cause him to ruthlessly lambaste himself for all of his sins\u2026. this was the best passage you could\u2019ve read. This was God speaking to him. Now he knew the truth, and Christianity became the last religion he converted to.\n\nSaint Augustine would spend the rest of his life making a case for Christianity against it\u2019s many competitors and critics during his day. In the process he would write by far the most brilliant philosophical works of his time period and would foreshadow to concepts that changed the world over 1000 years later. He may be one of the main reasons why Christianity prevailed over all of it\u2019s competitors.\n\nOne key idea that was a central theme of last episode with Plotinus is the apparent dichotomy between evil in the physical world and the existence of a benevolent God. If you remember, Plotinus made the case that evil is better described as just an absence of good, and really to be fair to middle Platonists\u2026 and actually Plato himself says in his work \u201cGorgias\u201d that evil only is manifested by an absence of something\u2026the point I\u2019m making is that it wasn\u2019t an idea unique to Plotinus to say that evil is only an absence of good. Plotinus just organized everything and popularized this three tiered fountain approach which explained how the physical world is so far removed from the source of good.. \u201cthe one\u201d that it stands to reason that that absence of good can be there.\n\nWell there are obviously differences between Saint Augustine\u2019s world view and the world view of Plotinus and his hierarchy of being\u2026but it\u2019s important to point out that the relationship between these two men is BY FAR the biggest contribution that Saint Augustine made to philosophy. Make no mistake\u2026Saint Augustine made huge strides when it came to Christian thought\u2026he defended orthodox thinking like nobody else\u2026but philosophy owes him a massive debt of gratitude because of the fact that he managed to fuse together the philosophy of Plotinus with Christianity. Saint Augustine is commonly referred to as a Christian Platonist. There\u2019s no telling what would\u2019ve happened to Platonism or ALL of earlier philosophy if it weren\u2019t for this merger that he pulled off\u2026but if the fate of Plato\u2019s thought was anything like all the other philosophy of the ancient Greek world and the Hellenistic age, then I think if it weren\u2019t for Saint Augustine we might only know Plato through a few obscure fragments that managed to survive. This is why Saint Augustine is a hero to philosophy\u2026he kept it going during a time when it had no business\u2026 going. That said, he was an INCREDIBLY brilliant man who made completely unique philosophical works as well as adaptations of older works. But back to what I was talking about before\u2026the question from last episode. How can evil exist in a world created and maintained by a benevolent god? Well Plotinus attributed it to the distance between this lower matter and the transcendent \u201cone\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d. Saint Augustine didn\u2019t think the same way\u2026so he had to find a way to answer this question. His answer was the most comprehensive approach to date of a concept that still rocks philosophers to this day. Evil exists because humans have free will. The idea was simple\u2026 humans are rational creatures\u2026 that seems to be a given. But the only way humans can TRULY be rational creatures is if they have the ability to make choices. Most importantly, to make choices between murdering that guy or NOT murdering that guy\u2026stealing your neighbors bar B cue or NOT stealing your neighbors bar b cue. He calls this ability to choose between good courses of action or bad courses of action\u2026 Free will. Saint Augustine points out that in the book of Genesis when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, he left the choice of whether to listen to the talking snake and take the fruit up to them\u2026 this is an early glimpse at the relationship between God and all other humans. We have the ability to make choices either to our benefit or detriment. It naturally follows that these choices can be to the benefit or detriment of others\u2026when they\u2019re to the detriment of others we might call them \u201cevil\u201d. This is how evil can exist in a world with a benevolent God as it\u2019s creator and overseer. The concept of evil actually has nothing to do with God, it has to do with human action. These detrimental actions are just a necessary expense of having a bodily existence with the right to choose.\n\nThe important part here is that Saint Augustine was heavily influenced by Plotinus and this wasn\u2019t the only issue where he was influenced. it turns out\u2026Plotinus and his hierarchy of being\u2026the Three tiered fountain that all of creation stems from makes a pretty good companion philosophical doctrine to Christianity and their idea of the trinity. Saint Augustine was able to merge the two. But one interesting part of his quest to merge Neo-Platonism with Christianity is a problem that he ran into when thinking about Plotinus\u2019 concept of \u201cthe one\u201d. Saint Augustine would have been thinking about \u201cthe one\u201d as God. For Plotinus, \u201cthe one\u201d was independent of EVERYTHING else. There was absolutely no way to describe it\u2026so it goes without saying that it has existed forever, eternally\u2026because if it existed in relation to time\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be a singularity\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cthe one\u201d anymore\u2026it would be\u2026\u201dthe two\u201d. But this didn\u2019t merge well with the Christian idea that God created the heavens and earth, because when something has a Creation\u2026people can always ask\u2026well what came before that?\n\nSaint Augustine reconciled the problem by creating a conception of time that was so ahead of its time and different from everything else that had come before it\u2026 it\u2019s almost like he heard a kid chanting it next door to him.\n\nWe can think of Saint Augustine\u2019s theory of time as being broken down into two parts. What is time in reality? and how is it measured?\n\nWell he takes a page out of Aristotle\u2019s book when trying to classify what time is exactly and he looks to the efficient cause of time as a starting point and it also clears up the questions everyone has about how what the relationship is between the Christian god and time\u2026 he talks about it here in his Confessions when he is talking to god about the questions these naive people have:\n\n\u201cHow could these countless ages have elapsed when you, the Creator, in whom all ages have their origin, had not yet created them? What time could there have been that was not created by you? How could time elapse if it never was? Furthermore, although you are before time, it is not in time that you precede it. If this were so, you would not be before all time.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying here is that God created time. Because he created time, he couldn\u2019t have existed \u201cwithin the fabric of time\u201d so therefore, he exists external to it and isn\u2019t affected by it. This may seem a little disappointing to some people, but it gets better because he\u2019s nowhere near done. Once he established that God gets all the credit for time\u2026then he started to wonder what it is exactly\u2026and how do you measure it? He sets the stage for a while in his Confessions and he really gets this state of confusion that he\u2019s in across:\n\n\u201cMy soul speaks with truth when it confesses to you that I do measure time. Is it the case then Lord, my god that I perform the act of measuring but do not know what I am measuring? I measure the motion of a body in time. Is it the case that I do not measure time itself?\u201d\n\nMost of us measure time in terms of past, present and future. But Augustine makes the case that the way we think of the concepts of past, present and future are wrong\u2026 in fact nothing exists in REALITY except for the present. The past has already happened and doesn\u2019t exist anymore\u2026 and the future hasn\u2019t happened yet, so can it really be said to exist? He thought the concepts of past and future are really just human constructs to make sense of the world around us\u2026 he said:\n\n\u201cIt is inaccurate to say, \u201cthere are three tenses of time: past, present and future,\u201d though it might properly be said, \u201cthere are three tenses of times: the present of past things, the present of present things, the present of future things.\u201d These are three realities in the mind, but nowhere else as far as I can see, for the present of past things is memory, the present of present things is attention, and the present of future things is ex[expectation. If we are allowed to put it that way, I do see three tenses or times, and admit that they are three.\u201d\n\nHe goes on and describes the way that the human brain measures time:\n\n\u201cIt is in you, my mind that I measure time. Do not interrupt me, or rather do not allow yourself to be interrupted by the thronging of your impressions. It is in you, I say that I measure time. As things pass by they leave an impression in you. This impression remains after the things have gone into the past, and it is this impression which I measure in the present, not the things which in their passage caused the impression. It is this impression which I measure when I measure time. Therefor, either this itself is time, or else I do not measure time at all.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is\u2026 Time is nothing in reality. It only exists in relation to the human brain\u2019s way that it perceives reality. Time is an illusion created by our minds to make sense of the world around us. This was incredibly ahead of it\u2019s time\u2026and he sums it up with a great quote here:\n\n\u201cWhat is true of the poem as a whole is true equally of its individual stanzas and syllables. The same is true of the whole long performance, in which this poem may be a single item. The same thing happens in the entirety of a person\u2019s life, of which all his actions are parts; and the same in the entire sweep of human history, the parts of which are individual human lives.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_13": {"date": "2014-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2014\nEpisode 17 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 17 on Philosophy of Boethius.\u00a0\n\nTry to imagine yourself trapped in a prison cell\u2026convicted to death\u2026NO CHANCE of an appeal\u2026you KNOW you\u2019re going to die soon in a horrific, painful way for something you didn\u2019t do. How would you spend your time? This isn\u2019t just me being dramatic\u2026REALLY try to put yourself in that situation and ask yourself\u2026what would be important to you in that moment?\n\nBoethius was a medieval neo-platonist philosopher who found himself in that moment. He actually had a pretty good standing in the world\u2026considering he was living in a society that was growing increasingly corrupt and intolerant\u2026the Roman Empire was crumbling heading towards where in modern times we have the luxury of knowing where it eventually would go but the people of the time didn\u2019t know. And the entire peninsula of Italy was controlled by a group of wonderful gentlemen known as the Ostrogoths.\n\nLet me tell you about who Boethius was working for. The Ostrogoths were led by a guy named Theoderic the Great. Just to get an idea of the types of moves this guy would pull in the interest of gaining and sustaining power let me tell you about how he took control of Italy in the first place. He was fighting an army led by a guy named Odoacer. Theodoric wins a couple battles\u2026JUST SO THAT ODOACER gets on his back foot a little bit\u2026and right when hes in this place of vulnerability\u2026a bishop acts as a mediator between the two leaders and arranges a negotiation for a peace treaty. Theodoric agrees to a treaty where BOTH of them would occupy the area together and BOTH make decisions\u2026kind of combine their forces and have a period of peace. So Theodoric calls a celebratory banquet\u2026were gonna sit down\u2026have a feast and revel in this new arrangement we\u2019ve come to\u2026well at the banquet Theodoric stands up\u2026makes a toast\u2026does the little clinky thing on his glass\u2026and then stabs Odoacer in the neck.\n\nIt says in a text called the Anonymous Valesianus\u2026that right after Theoderic kills him:\n\n\u201cThat same day, all of Odoacer\u2019s army who could be found anywhere were killed by order of Theoderic, as well as all of his family.\u201d[44] Odoacer\u2019s wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church. Theoderic exiled Odoacer\u2019s son Thela to Gaul, but when he attempted to return to Italy Theoderic had him killed.\u201d\n\nThis guy is the RULER of everything. But more importantly, he\u2019s Boethius\u2019s boss! This is the guy hes an adviser to. Boethius\u2019s life resembles a common theme in Hollywood and pop culture. The example that comes to mind is the Prince of Egypt\u2026highly underrated Dreamworks movie\u2026EVEN MORE UNDERRATED soundtrack. But I think the reference is a little too obscure\u2026and it really doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve all heard the story of Boethius told in some capacity. He was orphaned at a very young age and was adopted by a rich, aristocratic family. This privileged upbringing yielded a top-level education for his extremely above-average brain\u2026and this warranted him eventually being given a job as chief adviser to Theoderic the great. Now the reason why his upbringing is significant is because he led a privileged life. And one typical hallmark of a person who was spoiled rotten throughout their childhood is that they don\u2019t appreciate anything. and Im not saying Boethius was by ANY means the extreme version of this, he didn\u2019t belong on my super sweet 16\u2026but its not crazy to think there were remnants of it.\n\nLet me tell you about how Boethius ended up in prison.\n\nThere was a meeting of the Royal Council in Verona where a guy named Cyprianus accused a guy named Albinus of treason, but neither of these guys are really important\u2026the important part is what Boethius did. He was a loyal guy. He came to Albinus\u2019s defense and tried to show everyone there how flawed their way of thinking was\u2026he said:\n\n\u201cThe charge of Cyprianus is false, but if Albinus did that, so also have I and the whole senate with one accord done it; it is false, my Lord King.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow this is the part in the movie where everyone is supposed to look at each other and be like \u201coh yeah hes right\u2026look at what we\u2019ve come to, thank you Boethius\u201d one person starts clapping really slow. Instead they just said\u2026\u201dalright then you can be guilty of treason too!\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t work out that well. So all of a sudden\u2026Boethius finds himself stripped of EVERYTHING. Stripped of his home\u2026his family\u2026his work\u2026even his FREEDOM. His existence consisted of sitting in this dark cell\u2026wrongly accused of treason\u2026waiting to be put to death. And this is why I asked that question at the top of the show\u2026If for some reason i was wrongly convicted of death\u2026id be a lot of things..id be angry\u2026id be weeping\u2026id be like those prisoners in pirates of the Caribbean with the bone trying to coax the dog over with the keys in his mouth\u2026One things for certain, I wouldn\u2019t be writing a philosophical text that solves one of the oldest problems in philosophy and paves the way for ALL subsequent medieval philosophy.\n\nWhy did he do it? Most of the writing from him before hes commentating on Aristotle or other Greek philosophy. Why did he choose to start now? Well I think that unjustly having EVERYTHING taken away from him\u2026including his life was SO TRAUMATIC\u2026that it was only after he was removed from his largely privileged life up until that point that he understood the complete value of philosophy. His book was called \u201cThe consolation of Philosophy\u201d because Philosophy, CONSOLES us within the adversity that the world inevitably throws our way.\n\nThe book starts out REALLY dark. Boethius is ready to die\u2026hes sad, angry\u2026all the things you\u2019d expect from someone that is going to be wrongly put to death\u2026but remember this is just a character in a book. the REAL Boethius is writing the book. hes in a COMPLETELY different mental state. Now as he is complaining about his unfortunate situation\u2026he looks up and realizes that there is a woman TOWERING over him. But not just a woman\u2026a really STRANGE woman\u2026she has all these weird characteristics\u2026her height keeps fluctuating\u2026she has a glow about her\u2026but more importantly Boethius notices that she has Greek letters sewn into her dress. At the top she has the letter \u201cTheta\u201d \u2026At the bottom she has the letter \u201cPi\u201d\u2026shes carrying a stack of books in one hand and a scepter in the other\u2026i always think of the statue of liberty. Well, this strange woman is known as lady philosophy. The letter \u201cTheta\u201d sewn into the top of her dress symbolizes the metaphysics branch of philosophy and the letter \u201cPi\u201d at the bottom of the dress symbolizes the branch of ethics. Shes supposed to be a physical embodiment of philosophy. She\u2019s also supposed to be a physical embodiment of wisdom\u2026remember Boethius was a neo-platonist\u2026this LADY PHILOSOPHY serves the same purpose to Boethius as Socrates served to Plato in his dialogues\u2026the quintessentially wise person\u2026and the true philosophy of the author.\n\nBoethius stays humble\u2026when you watch QVC or any of those home shopping channels\u2026its always two people that are entirely dissimilar\u2026one guy, for some reason knows EVERYTHING about this rice cooker hes selling and the other guy for some reason has managed to navigate the world and tie their shoes every morning, yet has NEVER EVEN HEARD OF RICE. let alone tried to cook it.\n\nWell in the consolation of philosophy, Boethius is the Quintessential Naive person and lady philosophy is the quintessential wise person who is educating him on his wrong thinking. The irony is that both of them are Boethius.\n\nThroughout the book he lays out a lot of great stuff\u2026not all of it new, revolutionary stuff, but all of it written in a satisfying way. The stuff that was revolutionary is enough to make him the most influential philosopher of the time period. But before we hear the infinite wisdom of Lady Philosophy we need to talk about Aristotle. One of the most famous works by Aristotle and one that has been talked about a lot in recent years is his work called \u201cOn Interpretation\u201d Boethius and many later philosophers respond to this work directly and now seems like the best time to talk about it. I mean, if I talked about it back when we did the episode on Aristotle it would just be a vague memory at this point and his argument is actually very important. Its sometimes known as Aristotle\u2019s Sea Battle Analogy.\n\nThe big question that Aristotle addresses in this part of \u201cOn Interpretation\u201d is the question of:\n\nAre things predestined and out of our control or do we, as humans, get to choose what we do?\n\nWhat Aristotle says is that nobody would disagree that there are statements that can be directly contradictory to each other. Two people holding opposite viewpoints where one of them HAS to be true. You can think of a million different examples of this\u2026but the one that Aristotle uses is that one person says \u201cthere will be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d and the other person says \u201cthere WONT be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d.\n\nNow, ONE of these has to be true. There either WILL be a sea battle tomorrow or there wont be. And because its the type of contradiction where ONE guy has to be right and the other guy has to be wrong\u2026the statement is JUST as true now as it will be tomorrow when it actually happens or doesn\u2019t happen. You could say there NEEDS to be a sea battle tomorrow\u2026you could say there is no situation possible where there CANT be a sea battle tomorrow because that statement is true right now. The implications of this is that nothing at all is possible except for what actually happens.\n\nThis is an ancient Greek, very Aristotelian way of looking at something else that is a lot more familiar to us in modern times. In the times of Boethius, The popular belief was the God knows what will happen tomorrow. He knows everything. He KNOWS whether the sea battle will or will not take place. But if that is true\u2026how much control do we really have over our actions?\n\nLast episode we talked about Saint Augustine and his explanation for how its possible that a supernatural god can exist and still allow evil to happen in the world. His answer, if you remember, has to do with free will. God wanted and created a world where humans possess free will. Saint Augustine said that if that is the case, then evil is something we need to be willing to accept as a possibility. Its not that God WANTS evil to happen. Its not that he COULDNT stop things from taking place\u2026its just that if he did\u2026it would blow the whole system. Then people don\u2019t have free will anymore, and how can you eternally judge someone based on something other than immoral actions taken based on their own volition.\n\nNow Boethius had ALL of this information. Boethius answers the question of\u2026how can we be said to have free will if god already knows what were going to do in the future by making a distinction between divine foreknowledge and predestination.\n\nWhen I first read Boethius, this changed the way I looked at things\u2026what Boethius says is that there is a HUGE difference between God KNOWING something will happen and God Pre-slating out everything that WILL happen and we have no control over it. But that\u2019s just part of what Boethius says\u2026we need to be clear on this though. God\u2019s KNOWLEDGE of things that have happened, are happening or will happen is a DIFFERENT THING than God forging a destiny for everyone ahead of time that they cant deviate from.\n\nKNOWING something will happen doesn\u2019t predestine it to happen. Now if you\u2019re a really smart person and you\u2019re quick at thinking you might say that\u2026Once we\u2019ve made that distinction, Why are we even here? Lets say God only KNOWS what you\u2019re going to do before you do it\u2026why not just have judgment day on the first day of existence? He already knows whether you\u2019re going to follow the rules well enough to be admitted into the country club! Doesn\u2019t that just make our free will a bunch of smoke and mirrors that really aren\u2019t necessary?\n\nWell Boethius would argue that:\n\n\u201cEverything is known, not according to itself, but according to the capacity of the knower.\u201d\n\nThe way we can apply this brilliant concept to what were talking about with free will is by understanding that we percieve everything in the world through the lens of being a human being. That Human interpretation of things may be useful to us in a lot of ways\u2026but it would be naive to think its the COMPLETE picture of anything. Just how a Goldfish might look out of its fishbowl and think your living room is the rest of the ocean\u2026humans might look at something and misperceive it too.\n\nWhat Boethius says we are MOST guilty of misperceiving is the nature of TIME. Remember, Saint Augustine said that time doesn\u2019t really exist\u2026its a human construct that we use to categorize information about the world around us. Well Boethius agreed\u2026but he said that\n\nbecause as humans we live in a constant flux of past present and future\u2026we think about it in a narrow way. We think about it in terms of things that have happened..things that are happening now\u2026and things that are going to happen. God, on the other hand, as Saint Augustine said as well, exists OUTSIDE of time\u2026he lives inside of an eternal present\u2026\n\nMaybe a better way to think of it is to Think of how you interact with other things that are existing in the present with you. If you and your friend decide you are gonna get in shape and you\u2019re gonna go on a jog together and you\u2019re running along with your friend and you start to get tired\u2026and lightheaded and hot pockets are spinning around your head\u2026your friends knowledge that you are jogging right now in this moment\u2026doesn\u2019t change your ability to stop running and throw up all over the ground\u2026just like that\u2019s the interaction in THIS present moment, gods knowledge of your future doesn\u2019t stop you from changing it. He lives in an eternal present.\n\nNow if you still disagree, don\u2019t worry. The centuries will go by and you\u2019ll feel more and more at home, but try to appreciate the brilliance here. Boethius was wrongly convicted to death rotting in a cell writing about these imaginary conversations he was having with this \u201clady philosophy\u201d. In fact, right now is a good time to talk about how Boethius says philosophy serves to console us in times of hardship.\n\nSo as I said before the book starts out with Boethius really depressed and sad\u2026a little bit like Eeyore\u2026and then lady philosophy, the wise owl swoops in and corrects his faulty ways of thinking that are leading to this place of suffering. She asks him whats wrong\u2026and he tells her about the meeting\u2026and the wrongful conviction and the unjust tyrants that took away EVERYTHING from him\u2026his wealth, his home, his career, and ultimately his life\u2026and lady philosophy\u2026in her own way\u2026just kind of scoffs. She didn\u2019t see any reason to be acting like EEYORE\u2026she says to Boethius:\n\n\u201cIf I have fully diagnosed the cause and nature of your condition, you are wasting away in pining and longing for your former good fortune. It is the loss of this which, as your imagination works upon you, has so corrupted your mind. I know the many disguises of that monster, Fortune, and the extent to which she seduces with friendship the very people she is striving to cheat, until she overwhelms them with unbearable grief at the suddenness of her desertion\u201d\n\nTo Boethius, when bad things happen and we allow them to affect us\u2026we are wallowing in our bad fortune. Our Mis-fortunes. When I think of fortune I think of Las Vegas, Nevada. Beautiful city\u2026a place I wish I could go again and I\u2019m not really all that into prostitution or mainlining drugs. But I still have a great time\u2026and if you\u2019ve ever been there for a few days you might have had a similar experience. I walked into the various casinos on the first day and I see all the people playing the slot machines and I think\u2026wow this is awesome\u2026all these people have hope\u2026maybe it\u2019ll be me that hits the big jackpot\u2026yeah the casino strictly regulates the payout and yes I know the odds are heavily against me\u2026but maybe I\u2019ll be the lucky one. But with each day that passes the slot machines are full of people\u2026you see some with a look of desperation in their eyes\u2026you see people doing all sorts of superstitious things attributing winning and losing to things other than chance\u2026you know\u2026I didn\u2019t have my lucky rabbits foot on the OUTSIDE of my clothes so THATS why i didn\u2019t win\u2026you see the casino handing out free drinks to the people gambling\u2026maybe you see the same person from yesterday\u2026and it looks like they\u2019ve been there EVERY day for the past decade. I stopped feeling excited for this collective sense of hope and started feeling sorry for some of these people. All the casinos post signs that give out the number to the problem gambling hotline.\n\nWell Boethius would say that we ALL need to call the problem gambling hotline. But not because were playing kitty cat slot machine too much\u2026its because we share the same delusional expectation of nothing but good fortune in our everyday lives. When Boethius is sulking in his cell and complaining about his loss of good fortune\u2026lady philosophy tells him that fortune is like a wheel. A wheel of fortune. The things that he had that he considered good fortune weren\u2019t actually things that he HAD at all. His health, his freedom, his house, his clothes\u2026these things don\u2019t actually belong to him\u2026so how can they be taken away from him? And besides\u2026his situation is far from the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to anyone\u2026EVEN AS HE WAITS IN HIS CELL\u2026waiting for his unjust death sentence, he STILL has tons fortune\u2026she points out his ability to reason and write his ideas down. In fact, when you add everything up honestly, even if you\u2019re sentenced to death, how can you say that you aren\u2019t on the net positive side of fortune. Boethius says:\n\n\u201cBalance out the good things and the bad that have happened in your life and you will have to acknowledge that you are still way ahead. You are unhappy because you have lost those things in which you took pleasure? But you can also take comfort in the likelihood that what is now making you miserable will also pass away.\u201d\n\nSome people might see this as a warming over of Buddhism or Stoicism\u2026and there are a lot of similarities. But to put it in terms of a Wheel of fortune that is constantly giving and taking away the earthly things we see as good really makes me think of myself as no different than the people playing the slots in Las Vegas. Except while they\u2019re using disposable vacation income, I\u2018m wagering my own happiness.\n\nThe bottom line was this: If you follow philosophy to a T\u2026you are impervious to all these misfortunes in the world. The real thing you should focus on is virtue. Virtues are the tools you use to achieve happiness. Boethius said:\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperiled by the vicissitudes of fortune.\u201d\n\nIn fact, its the types of things that humans would typically see as bad fortune that is actually the GREATEST fortune\u2026because its THAT fortune that does the most good in the long run for the person receiving it. The things we see as GOOD fortune are actually pretty deceptive\u2026they allow us to delude ourselves into thinking that we are TRULY happy, when in actuality these conditions are extremely fragile. At least MISfortunes show us how bad things could be and therefore, how good we have it currently. He says:\n\n\u201cAll fortune is good fortune; for it either rewards, disciplines, amends, or punishes, and so is either useful or just.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_14": {"date": "2014-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2014\nEpisode 18 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 18 on Avicenna.\n\nI\u2019ve sat up the last few nights thinking about the best way to describe where we are, in the history of philosophy. Where we\u2019ve come from. We\u2019ve covered a lot. I found myself trying to think of the best metaphor I could use to tie it all together and give a little bit of context to this period of time we\u2019re moving into, because I know where this is all heading. I think many of us know where this is all heading. Things are about to get really awesome, and I had all these examples and metaphors I was throwing around in my head and none of them really captured what I was going for and then it hit me. Philosophy, in so many ways, is like the process of starting a maintaining a fire. Fire doesn\u2019t just start out of nowhere; It takes a spark. And that spark doesn\u2019t just instantly erupt into roaring flames, unless you\u2019re throwing a cigarette out the window in southern California. Barring that one exception, that spark takes work. You got to put it inside of the handful of tree shavings and leaves, you got to blow on it, you have to nurture it. We talked for a long time on this show about the Presocratics. Now, none of these guys had ideas that held up to scrutiny for very long, I mean sure we still talk about people like Heraclitus and Parmenides but their ideas were more landmarks of thought than philosophical endgames. But these Presocratics were incredibly important nonetheless, if for no other reason than they began the discourse that was necessary. They are the sparks that started the fire. Yeah, one spark may pop up and just instantly fade away, not starting the big fire, but we needed people like Thales to exist. We needed someone to look around them and say, \u201cI think everything is made of water.\u201d so that then someone else could say, \u201cWhat are you, stupid? You think air is made of water?\u201d so that Thales could then say, \u201cOkay, prove me wrong.\u201d They started that discourse and that discourse was the spark that eventually turned into the roaring white hot flames of Athens during antiquity. During the Hellenistic Age. But then with the political troubles, the looking back to years past when things were better, the radical shift in the average person\u2019s philosophy of self, the popularity of skepticism; all these things led to philosophy slowing down, things headed in a more dogmatic direction. We ran out of fuel, we ran out of logs to keep the fire of philosophy going and it started to get smaller and less hot. Then with the rise of these new monotheistic religions that didn\u2019t see much value in looking for truth outside of what they saw as the truth, I mean why would you really, it was like dumping a bucket of water on the fire. And here we are in this smoldering phase. People that have taken any sort of forest or camping safety course know that a fire can go on for a long time after it\u2019s seemingly put out. It may not look hot, but that heat is still trapped inside of those embers and you got to really make sure you stamp it out or there\u2019s a possibility it could find a twig or a leaf and start back up again. This period of time we\u2019re heading into is really like this smoldering phase where once every couple hundred years, some polymath genius comes along and stirs up the embers, and you can see the red and orange you can feel the heat of the fire of philosophy again, if only for a moment. Avicenna was one of these people that stirred up the fire. He kept the fire going long enough to get to the moment in history that all of this is leading up to when someone comes along and dumps a bucket of gasoline on that fire.\n\nBut today\u2019s episode is about one of the most brilliant men who has ever lived: Avicenna. Now, personally I have a deep respect for Avicenna just because of the circumstances he was born into. We\u2019re talking 950 AD. There\u2019s an Islamic saying that goes, \u201cthe ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr.\u201d This was the thinking in Baghdad during the centuries leading up to Avicenna. It was truly an incredible time in history. You had a culture of people where one of their top priorities was collecting the world\u2019s knowledge. They wanted all of the worlds wisdom translated into Arabic. Turns out it was a good move for them, they experienced what is known as the Islamic Golden Age. While the west is going through their Dark Ages, the Arabic speaking world is having monumental leaps forward in almost every, single category. Mathematics, Medicine, Architecture, Science and most importantly for us, Philosophy. If it weren\u2019t for 8th, 9th, 10th century Baghdad, we might not know who Plato and Aristotle were really. They were the guys that translated it and kept writing commentaries on it. Now the head and shoulders above, fan favorite was Aristotle. He was the gold standard if you were living as a philosopher in this region. And just to illustrate how much Avicenna stirred up the fire of philosophy, people think of this region\u2019s philosophy as all of the philosophy before Avicenna where they made commentaries on Aristotle, and all of the philosophy after Avicenna where they made commentaries on Avicenna. That\u2019s how much he changed things.\n\nBut Avicenna didn\u2019t live in Baghdad. He was born in a small town that we\u2019d know as modern day Uzbekistan, so how did he benefit from all this? It kind of reminds me of listening to Adam Carolla in recent years. \u201cDon\u2019t you just hate it when you\u2019re so talented, successful and rich that your personal maid hides your remote control from you and you can\u2019t find it for twelve seconds? What a terrible inconvenience.\u201d Well, that\u2019s kind of how the Caliphate was feeling in 9th century Baghdad. They were having problems dealing with the quandaries that come with having a sprawling empire that was almost as big as Rome at its height. They changed the capital city around, there was some in-fighting concerning the direction all this was going in, but the important part is that this cultural center of Baghdad, this mylar balloon filled to the brim, just stretching and bursting at the seams ready to explode, the centralized control over it dwindled a bit. And what happened was some of these outlying towns near Bagdhad starting getting more access to this Hellenic Philosophy translated into Arabic. There still was no Academy or Lyceum that taught a structured curriculum of philosophy for Avicenna to attend, but at least he had access to the information. Avicenna was a mostly self-educated guy. Not to belittle how brilliant he was, but that self-education probably contributed to him having such a unique perspective on Aristotle.\n\nThe loosening of the grip on Baghdad, the heightened access to knowledge and education, the ambition and brilliance of someone like Avicenna, all of these things remind me of modern times. When have we ever had as much access to educating ourselves for free as we do today? You see when you have a very special person like Avicenna what even a little bit of education can do, what happens when Avicenna has the entire internet? What happens when Avicenna has podcasts to listen to? We live in amazing times for realizing human potential. Bryan Cranston himself couldn\u2019t make meth strong enough to give to the printing press to make it as influential as the internet will be. Google is the modern day 9th century Baghdad, and I wonder how many Avicennas have been flipping burgers or digging ditches over the last thousand years.\n\nSo like all the other philosophers in his region, Avicenna was influenced most heavily by Aristotle. But he wasn\u2019t just going to roll over and accept everything Aristotle had to say as the gospel truth. In fact, he already had a gospel truth, Islam. He reads Aristotle, finds the parts he doesn\u2019t agree with and dismantles it with his own brilliance. But Avicenna wouldn\u2019t see it as dismantling. He saw it as healing. His most famous work actually directly translates to \u201cthe healing\u201d. He heals Aristotle to be compatible with Islam. And this is one of those hallmarks of medieval philosophy that is the reason most universities skip huge chunks of this period, is philosophy becomes not the search for truth, but the quest to validate what you already believe as the truth. By far the thing he is most known for is his \u201cFlying Man\u201d thought experiment. But before we can talk about that, we have to understand a big area of disagreement among philosophers, an area where Avicenna heavily disagreed with Aristotle: the relationship between Mind and Body.\n\nYou can think of Aristotle\u2019s thoughts on the relationship between mind and body by thinking of an iPhone. Or any cellphone or electronic device for that matter, but using the term \u201cmind\u201d might be a little misleading if we think about it in modern terms. The definitions of words get a little hazy back then, Aristotle uses the word soul to describe this a lot, but what he is referring to is the \u201crational soul\u201d. Our ability to reason, whatever existence is present in our minds. Now what he says, is that mind and body are one. Indivisible. Inseparable. This is the opposite of Plato who would say that the soul and body are separate, with the soul being chained to the body, shackled within the body waiting to be released. But for Aristotle they were one and it\u2019s not that he has some deep argument proving this is the case, he just kind of points out how silly it would be to focus on that question, because we don\u2019t do it in any other area of existence. We don\u2019t do it with other things. He says:\n\n\u201cIt is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying here is that if you took an iPhone, that iPhone has a certain contoured shape and form. When we think about things, the shape of the iPhone is one thing, the materials it\u2019s made out of is another thing, but do we think about them as two separate things?\n\nIf you answered yes, Aristotle would argue that you could say that that shape or form is what makes it an iPhone because if you melted it down into just a hunk of burnt electronics, it wouldn\u2019t be an iPhone anymore. And when you do that, does the shape of the iPhone remain there in some mysterious way? Of course not. Well based on this Aristotle says:\n\n\u201cIt is not unclear that the soul \u2013 or certain parts of it, if it naturally has parts \u2013 is not separable from the body\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re probably going, \u201cWait a second, how did we get there? Weren\u2019t we talking about the shape or form of something in relation to the materials it\u2019s made out of? How does that make the rational part of the soul inseparable from the body?\u201d\n\nWell to Aristotle, the rational part of the soul is the form of a human being. Think about it, there are many things that could have the shape of a human being. I can think of all kinds of humanoid robots, other monkey like creatures, things that may have the shape of a human, but aren\u2019t human. What shapes a human, to Aristotle is our ability to reason and the other functions of the rational soul. So maybe the better example to explain how Aristotle thinks of the relationship between mind and body for humans is that if you had an iPhone, if you took the IOS software off of that iPhone, you wouldn\u2019t have an iPhone anymore. You\u2019d have a really shiny brick to ward of common street criminals with, but not an iPhone. The relationship between mind and body to Aristotle is similar to the relationship between an iPhone and its software. What the word iPhone symbolizes to us cannot exist without that software. It wouldn\u2019t be the complete definition of iPhone. Aristotle talked a lot about this. If you put an iPhone in a blender and turned it into powder, Is that still an iPhone? No. In fact I think that\u2019s how they make most weight loss shakes so at that point it might change forms into a weight loss shake but the point is what if you took all the electronics out of the middle is that an iPhone? Well, at some point it needs to become an iPhone. When is that point? Aristotle would say that the blended powder of the iPhone, is only potentially an iPhone. Only when it is assembled does it become an iPhone.\n\nWell Avicenna didn\u2019t agree with Aristotle that the body and mind are one. This was a huge rift between the two of them. The reason why is because think of what Aristotle is saying by saying that the soul and body are inseparable. Just like there is no reason to believe that the shape of the iPhone sticks around after you\u2019ve melted the materials down, there is no reason to believe that the soul continues to exist after the body ceases to exist. This obviously wasn\u2019t compatible with the idea that you are a spiritual being that can look forward to eternal life in paradise. So what Avicenna had to do is somehow prove that the mind and body ARE separate entities from one another. What he creates is genius and it\u2019s known now as the Flying Man Thought experiment. Be ready to hear a lot more thought experiments in the future. Thought experiments to philosophers are like a hammer is to Jesus. You know, carpenters. The idea behind using thought experiments is that we exist in a very limited framework, and because of that framework, our thought is limited. Thought experiments change something about that framework. They pose some hypothetical situation and then ask, \u201cwhat if\u201d? And that \u201cwhat if\u201d usually makes us look at our current existence a little more openmindedly. Every sci-fi movie ever made is a thought experiment. Well Avicenna gives us one of the best ever:\n\n\u201cOne of us has to consider that one has been just created in a stroke, and that one has been thus created fully developed and perfectly complete , yet [created] with one\u2019s vision shrouded from watching external entities created falling in the air on in empty space in a fall not buffeted by any felt air that buffets it; its limbs separated and not in contact nor touching on another. Then let it contemplate whether it would affirm the existence of its own self. It would not then doubt the affirmation that its self is existent, yet not affirming the existence of any other limbs nor inner bowels, nor heart, nor brain, nor anything of the external things. Rather it was affirming the existence of its-self without affirming that it had length, breadth, or depth. And if it were possible for it, in such a state, to imagine a hand or any other limb, it would not then imagine it to be part of its-self nor to be condition of it.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is: Imagine yourself being reborn with all of your memories wiped\u2026floating through space but there are no stars. Only complete blackness, no sound no smells. Nothing to sense at all. Arms and legs separated, you\u2019re just floating through space. Now, if this existence was possible to be BORN into\u2026you certainly exist\u2026right? Maybe a different way of thinking of it is\u2026if you were wiped of your memories and put there now\u2026would you cease to exist simply because your body cant SENSE anything? It seems reasonable that you would have some sense of awareness you just wouldn\u2019t have any idea that you have a body. You wouldn\u2019t know to expect to have a body.\n\nSo, What is this self that exists? its certainly not your body parts\u2026because in this analogy you wouldn\u2019t even know that you have them. you don\u2019t KNOW that you have a body\u2026you don\u2019t know how big you are\u2026you could be an elephant for all your know\u2026what you DO know\u2026is that you exist. What this proves to Avicenna, is that the human body and the mind are separate from each other\u2026the flying man proves it.\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve taken the time to ask yourself \u201cHow do I know that I exist?\u201d You\u2019re probably a little weird. Don\u2019t worry man I\u2019m with you. Lady Gaga writes songs about people like us. Embrace it. And look, to be fair, there are just way too many good AMC shows and video games to watch nowadays to think about things like that. If Avicenna had grand theft auto five, I\u2019d be talking to you guys about the historical progression of different flavors of Doritos. None of this stuff would have gotten done. But one interesting thing to think about is that we actually address this question more often than we realize.\n\nWhenever we think about quality of existence, we think about the nature of existence. Despite the fact that it may seem unimportant we think about it a lot. For example, there\u2019s a character in Breaking Bad, I think it\u2019s Tuco\u2019s dad\u2026hes the really old, wheelchair bound guy with the little bell that he rings with his weird finger. Well, he has an existence where his body doesn\u2019t work, except for his finger, but his mind works. As humans, we still see him as existing, albeit in a lesser sense. He\u2019s a good way to remember Avicenna\u2019s Flying Man Thought experiment. But flip that around. What happens when someone is completely brain dead, but their body is still functioning. Their heart is still pumping their nervous system is still working, what is that person\u2019s existence like? The fact is, if someone we know was in a terrible accident most people would be far more likely to end life-support on the person who is brain dead than the person whose body is next to useless, but their brain is still functioning. By making a judgment on the quality of existence, we\u2019re asking at some level what is it to exist at all?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Avicenna wasn\u2019t trying to prove that he knows we exist simply because he is able to be self-aware. This is one of the rare occasions where I\u2019m going to jump ahead a little bit, just real quick. The Flying Man Theory has a lot of similarities to one of the biggest moments in the history of philosophy a few hundred years from now when a guy named Rene Descartes wrote: I think therefore I am.\n\nNow for the record, this is another reason why philosophy seems boring to some people because if you\u2019re an outsider talking to someone about philosophy and you go, oh, whats one of the big, awesome moments in the history of philosophy\u2026whats a moment that I should be impressed by. And the person says back to them, \u201cRene Descartes said: I think therefore, I am\u201d. And the outsider is like, \u201cReally? Well that\u2019s underwhelming. That\u2019s the sum total of thousands of years of human thought? That\u2019s one of the most obvious statements I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nWhat that outsider doesn\u2019t realize is the history that we talked about at the beginning of the show. The Presocratics, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the rise of skepticism. The co-existence of skepticism with all the schools of the Hellenistic Age. The Pyrrhonists. Generation after generation of philosophers asking how can you know ANYTHING for certain? Can you? It was all but accepted that humans could NEVER arrive at truth about anything because you can always say, well how do you know that? Then the rise of monotheism and for a thousand years humans claimed to have arrived at the truth, and then BAM! Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Galileo All of a sudden, we don\u2019t exist within an ordered cosmos as the Greeks saw it, we live in the middle of chaos. And what\u2019s worse, we don\u2019t seem that important in this chaos. It is impossible to know ANYTHING for certain. And along comes Rene Descartes.\n\nYou know, Avicenna\u2019s Flying Man is NOT the same as Descartes. Avicenna\u2019s would be I think therefore I\u2019m not only my body\u2026or I think therefore my body is separate from my rational soul. But I think it is just as brilliant as Descartes. If you want someone to be Descartes before Descartes, I think you\u2019d be better off looking to Saint Augustine who makes an extremely similar claim hidden in some obscure chapter of NOT his most famous work:\n\n\u201cBy not positively affirming that they are alive, the skeptics ward off the appearance of error in themselves, yet they do make errors simply by showing themselves alive; one cannot err who is not alive. That we live is therefore not only true, but it is altogether certain as well\u201d\n\nhe also says:\n\n\u00a0\u201cwho would doubt that he lives, remembers, understands, wills, thinks, knows, and judges? For even if he doubts, he lives; if he doubts, he remembers why he doubts; if he doubts, he understands that he doubts; if he doubts, he wishes to be certain; if he doubts, he thinks; if he doubts, he knows that he does not know; if he doubts, he judges that he ought not to consent rashly. Whoever then doubts about anything else ought never to doubt about all of these.\u201d\n\nWell, above all else, and this is something were going to talk about more in future episodes, although in many ways Avicenna\u2019s healing of Aristotle helped to make it compatible with Muslim teachings, the flying man thought experiment really was the complete opposite\u2026.it flew in the face of Islam. By saying that the soul is immortal and therefore doesn\u2019t need the body to live on in the afterlife, he was going against the orthodox Muslims of his time period who believed that both body AND mind are resurrected into the afterlife. The downside was that he was ruthlessly attacked for this, the upside is that he found favor with many later Christian thinkers. This brings me to the question of the week: Philosophize This! Is what Avicenna said true? Does his Flying Man thought experiment really make it impossible for the body and mind to be inseparable? I wonder if there is a way to link the feelings in the body with the thoughts that the rational soul has. Thank you for listening. Talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_15": {"date": "2014-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2014\nEpisode 19 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 19 on Three Islamic Truths.\n\nThe theme of today\u2019s episode is truth. When you think of truth, as it\u2019s own entity, there\u2019s not really that much controversy. I don\u2019t think most people disagree that it seems likely that there is an absolute truth about each individual facet of everything that exists. Some blanket single code about everything that is, the truth. That concept is pretty straightforward in itself. It\u2019s when humans start talking about truth that things get crazy. It\u2019s what that truth is, and what makes it true when viewing it through the lens of a human that is the tough question. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re all viewing the same exact scene, unfolding out in front of us, but we\u2019re all viewing it through a different filter and from a different vantage point.\nNow because of that, and this is something that is a big issue in philosophy, we might have to be willing to accept as humans that we\u2026 can\u2019t arrive at truth. We might have to accept that as beings living on this planet, whatever you think we are, that discovering the absolute truth about everything or anything isn\u2019t a function of our existence. We might not have the equipment to find the truth. I guess it kind of depends on what you believe in, if you think we evolved from monkeys, you might not think our brains are designed to necessarily understand the fabric of space and time\u2026you might think our brains are designed to socialize, pick bananas and reproduce. On the other hand, if you think we are spiritual beings, programmed into this body by God or some creator, maybe you think god didn\u2019t put us here to understand how he did everything, he put us here to follow a certain set of behavioral restrictions and to be judged. I mean, whatever you think, the key thing to note is that it\u2019s never been obvious to us what the truth was. And because of that ambiguity, truth has always been a subjective term. People arrive at their own truth about things. You hear it all the time, this is \u201cmy truth\u201d. Another question to ask is if you arrived at the truth, would you even know it? How could you know that THAT truth isn\u2019t just another step on your journey towards arriving at the truth? The subject is actually one of the biggest in philosophy and it\u2019s ten times more complicated than this, and it\u2019s focused on so much for good reason.\n\nJust think of what is at stake when we think about the truth. This is going to be a shocker to everybody listening. Throughout history, people haven\u2019t always agreed on what the truth is. You see the same story repeat itself all throughout human history. Some guy arrives at what he sees as the absolute truth, and then uses that truth as the basis for subjugating entire groups of people, for committing mass genocide, for trying to take over the world. What\u2019s even scarier about that is that most of these truths, at least at the time they were arrived at, seem to be based on sound logic. And what do you do when two really smart people arrive at what they call truth, and they\u2019re diametric opposites of each other? One of them has to be wrong and it has to be a problem with the method they used to arrive at the truth. So philosophers from the beginning have focused on that question, what is truth and what is the proper method to arrive at the truth? They realized that their answers to these questions, not only had their lives in the balance, but the future of all of humanity. They were thinking of us. And make no mistake, if they didn\u2019t do this, the world would be a very different place today.\n\nThat is what today\u2019s episode is: three genius thinkers from the Islamic world and their three completely different approaches to the best way to arrive at truth. They came to very different conclusions, but all three approaches are based on sound logic, they had to be. In fact, the entire middle-ages, at least when it comes to philosophy is distinguished by a heightened focus on logic. What\u2019s even more cool about their different approaches is that all three of them relate to us in modern times in some unique way. By the end of the show we\u2019ll not only see how thought progressed in the Islamic world throughout the centuries but we\u2019ll understand more about the two time periods on either side of Avicenna. Remember the period is typically broken down into two parts, before Avicenna and after Avicenna.\n\nSo, I guess the best way to start is to talk about that \u201cbefore Avicenna\u201d part. It began in the seventh century. There was a violent clashing of two different cultures coming together. But it\u2019s funny, if you were looking at it, it wouldn\u2019t really appear to be a violent clashing. You think of a violent clashing and you think of fireworks, explosions\u2026a Jason Statham movie. but it didn\u2019t happen in an instant. Sometimes when two cultures violently clash, its more like the violent clash that happens when two tectonic plates slam together and make a mountain. It\u2019s still a violent clashing it just takes place over a long period of time. The two tectonic plates that are colliding in our example today are this newly created Muslim empire in the seventh century and this large region of Iran, Iraq and Syria. The intellectual history of the region would eventually become embodied in the city of Baghdad, which would eventually become the capital city of this newly founded Muslim empire.\n\nSee, the truth for Baghdad was legitimized the region\u2019s rich history of science and philosophy for hundreds of years. Truth for the Muslim empire was legitimized by the sword. They conquered the entire region, it was under control of the Persian Empire at the time, and if you were living during that time you had two choices if they conquered you. Convert to Islam or pay an extremely high tax that most people couldn\u2019t afford. It certainly wasn\u2019t paradise for anyone living as a non-Muslim during this time period and region. The two cultures slammed together and there was a great deal of tension. It was kind of a weird place to be in if you\u2019re the Muslim empire. Nobody is going to beat you in a direct military engagement, the question just becomes how do you command the front lines of this culture war that is going on? Could the thought of the area, thought based around truth being arrived at through reason, with Hellenic Philosophy deeply intrenched in the culture; could that be reconciled with truth based on fulfillment of prophecy? Truth given to us by God and recorded in a book? Is it even possible to reconcile the two? The better question for the powerful Muslim empire was, What is the best way to deal with this problem? Should they forcefully take over cultural control of the entire area or should they try to find some sort of common ground between the two? Find some way they can coexist. Well, luckily for us they decided to try to coexist. And this attempt of philosophers to try to reconcile these two very different ways of looking at the truth is what defines this \u201cbefore Avicenna\u201d stage where they mostly translated work by Greek philosophers into Arabic. But as we touched on a little bit last time, it wasn\u2019t just translating. They also wrote commentaries on the earlier philosophers to try to explain to people of their time what they were saying. This is where Al Farabi comes into the picture.\n\nThere would not be a revolutionary thinker like Avicenna if there was no Al Farabi. There\u2019s a story Avicenna tells in one of his books where he tries to read Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and he just doesn\u2019t understand it. So he reads it again, and doesn\u2019t understand it. He says he read Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics 40 times and still didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. And the even more impressive thing is that 40 is just the number they used back then for \u201cI can\u2019t even count how many times, lets just call it 40\u201d. It\u2019s like saying \u201ca million kagillion\u201d. By the way, when you\u2019re turning 40 years old, you got to already feel a little insecure about getting older. It must be terrible when you think that your age is the hyperbole that people used to use as a number so high, the actual number doesn\u2019t even matter anymore. It really is cruel. But anyway, Avicenna didn\u2019t understand Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics until he read the commentary that Al Farabi wrote on it, and then instantly he understood. Even someone as brilliant as Avicenna couldn\u2019t get it because there was a giant cultural divide. Al Farabi describes it here:\n\n\u201cAristotle expressed the cannons of logic by means of words customary among the people of his language And used examples that were familiar to and current among the people of his day. but since the explanations of the people of the Arabic language are not customary to the people of Greece and the examples of the people of this time are different from the examples familiar to he Greeks, the points that Aristotle intended to clarify by means of these examples have become unclear to and not understood by the people of our time.\u201d\n\nSo what he\u2019s obviously alluding to there is that he is just like me! Al Farabi was doing his own version of Philosophize This! way back in the day. He realized something. When Aristotle was writing all of this stuff down, he was communicating it through the limited language that he had in his day, to the culture of his day, using examples that people of his day could understand. Al Farabi thought that maybe some of the blame for the current time not relating to and understanding what Aristotle had to say lied in the way it was explained. He updated the examples. He explained it in a way people actually cared about. He was a peacemaker between the two cultures and this really is what defines the philosophy of the time period. I mean, if you think Al Farabi is a peacemaker, you have to hear about Al Kindi. Al Kindi just wanted everyone to get along already. He spent a lot of his time trying to create a full philosophical system that fused together the best parts of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, who as we know are typically seen as too different to ever be fused together. But the most important peacemaking venture he embarked on was making a case for the fact that using philosophy to search for the truth and arriving at the truth through fulfillment of prophecy, are not mutually exclusive things. They both can exist alongside each other. Really, I think it comes down to the slightly different way Al Kindi defines philosophy that allows for the two to coexist.\n\nHe says:\n\u201cindeed the human art which is highest in degree and most noble in rank is the art of philosophy. the definition of which is the true knowledge of things insofar as is possible for man.\u201d\nIn so far as is possible for man! See, what Al Kindi believed is that we can\u2019t reasonably expect to be able to arrive at ALL truth through our ability to reason. I mean, just think of how HUGE that encyclopedia would be if we found the truth about every single thing. He thought we can certainly figure out a lot of things though. So we should use reason to know as much as we possibly can and then add on the divine knowledge given to us through prophets to fill in the gaps. Whatever we do though, the truth is the most important thing, not our feelings about the truth or what it says about who we are. He said:\n\n\u201cWe ought not to be ashamed of appreciating the truth and of acquiring it wherever it comes from even if it comes from races distant and nations different from us. for the seeker of truth, nothing takes precedence over the truth. the status of no one is diminished by the truth, rather does the truth ennoble all.\u201d\n\nThis is a beautiful sentiment from Al Kindi. The truth is the most important thing. Not how the truth makes you feel, not how different the person looks who is bringing you the truth, not how stupid you will feel for having not known the truth for so long. The truth ennobles all. The type of people Al Kindi is lecturing here, we still deal with these people all the time. One search for truth that almost everybody goes through in modern times at some level, is trying to find where you fit in the spectrum of modern politics. These people obviously disagree on a lot of things, both sides cite their own statistics proving their side to be correct, but they can\u2019t both be correct, so what do I think the truth is? And I think the reason so many people grow ambivalent about American politics is because these commentators on TV don\u2019t think about the truth like Al Kindi did, how can they possibly know what the truth is? I guess that\u2019s what both sides are banking on to a certain degree, but the average person has a full time job, a family, hobbies, a home to maintain, personal goals; when they start looking for what the truth is and they turn on MSNBC and hear how George Bush and his evil syndicate of minions are destroying the world and then they flip over to Fox News and hear how all of what they just heard is completely false and that it\u2019s really Obama that\u2019s the bad guy. If any of these people ever heard that science discovered that the other side was absolutely correct the whole time, they would NEVER acknowledge it. They\u2019d find some way to spin it so that they never need to make a concession and they\u2019d keep going on with what they do best. They aren\u2019t interested in the truth, or the real \u201cnews\u201d, they\u2019re not interested in ennobling all as Al Kindi would say. And given how much the media effects the decisions making of the average person, just imagine if they DID take a page out of Al Kindi\u2019s book.\n\nSo, it was the translations and commentaries by people like Al Kindi and Al Farabi that led to a great thinker like Avicenna. Then shortly after, people started commentating on what Avicenna had to say. And one of his most famous detractors, and a man that more than almost anyone else looked into what it meant to arrive at truth, was Al Ghazali. Now it\u2019s spelled Ghazali. But its pronounced Ghazali. I\u2019m not going to butcher your beautiful language, I\u2019m just going to call him Ghazali from now on and you\u2019ll know what I mean.\n\nAl Ghazali\u2019s search for what truth is began at a very early age. He said:\n\u201cconsequently as i drew near the age of adolescence, the bonds of mere authority ceased to hold me and inherited beliefs lost their grip upon me, for i saw that christian youths always grew up to be christian, Jewish youths to be Jews and Muslim youths to be Muslims. my inmost being was moved to discover what this original nature really was and what the beliefs derived from the authority of parents and teachers really were. and also to make distinctions among the authority based opinions and in distinguishing between the true and false in them. therefore i said within myself, to begin with, what i am looking for is knowledge of what things really are so i must undoubtedly try to find what knowledge really is.\u201d\n\nHe looked around him and saw that most people just kind of believe whatever the authority figures tell them to believe. He noticed that children that grow up in various religious settings always end up being the same religion as their parents, he noticed that teachers told students the way things were, but no one ever questioned it. He called those in the quote \u201cauthority based opinions\u201d. Al Ghazali saw that the authority figures usually were right, but not always, and they certainly weren\u2019t right simply because they were authority figures. So this led him to start questioning, everything around him. He asked himself, what should truth be based on? What can I know for certain? And the conclusion he came to is that the only things we can know for certain are things that are so true that it\u2019s impossible for anyone to even cause a doubt in your mind. Things that are so true they are practically self-evident.\n\nNow, as people who study philosophy we already know the dark, depressing road this is going to take him down. I mean we\u2019ve heard the stories of Carneades in Rome arguing for Justice one day and winning the crowd of Romans over and then arguing the complete opposite viewpoint, against justice and winning them over again. How is Al Ghazali going to arrive at a place where anything is self-evident?\n\nWell what he decides after thinking about it for a long time is that there are only two things he thinks we can be certain about sense perception and necessary truths. By sense perceptions hes talking about: unless if you\u2019re dreaming or hallucinating\u2026when we see something in front of us\u2026we can be sure it\u2019s there. by necessary truths, hes talking about things that are the case because their essence makes it so. things like a square has four sides. If a square didn\u2019t have four sides, it wouldn\u2019t be a square anymore. it is necessary that a square has four sides.\n\nBut he goes even further. He pulls a Socrates on himself. He asked, how can I be sure that I am not dreaming? How can I ever be sure that I won\u2019t exist in a realm where necessary truths no longer apply?\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cIs my reliance on sense perception and my trust on the soundness of necessary truths of the same kind as my previous trust in the beliefs i had merely taken over from others? and as the trust most men have in the results of thinking? or is it a justified trust that is in no danger of being betrayed or destroyed.\u201d\nWell you never pull a Socrates on yourself. He messed himself up. Apparently for 10 years he had this terrible disease of skepticism about everything. He was so distraught that it affected his physical health, he felt sick, no doctor knew what to do, he had to quit teaching and he decided to go on a spiritual journey that eventually cured him of his skepticism. He found out the flaw in his way of thinking that cursed him for so many years and here it was:\n\n\u201cFaith in prophecy is to acknowledge the existence of a sphere beyond reason; into this sphere an eye penetrates whereby man apprehends special objects of apprehension. From these, reason is excluded in the same way as the hearing is excluded from apprehending colours and sight from apprehending sounds and all the senses from apprehending the objects of reason.\u201d\n\nBasically what he\u2019s saying is look, reason is cool and all. We are human. We have limitations. How can we think that we can know EVERYTHING through reason? Some things we just cant through reason alone, and it is a narrow minded way of thinking to restrict yourself to only reason when arriving at conclusions. And when it comes to those things, all the rest of the truth we cant arrive at through reason, we need prophets to tell us the truth. He recognized that philosophy had some value, but we needed to keep it in its proper place. Philosophy needs to speak when spoken to, and never more. After all, at best philosophy was using reason to arrive at conclusions, you\u2019re never experiencing the truth first hand. He said \u201cWhat a difference between knowing the definition of health together with its causes, and being healthy.\u201d\n\nGhazali becomes a bit like Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting. Remember when he says to Matt Damon\u2019s character that I could ask you about art and you\u2019d probably quote every art book every written, but I bet you don\u2019t know what it feels like to look up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. He makes a distinction between knowing a ton about something, and actually experiencing it. The key for Al Ghazali was to understand that you can never think your way to arriving at the conclusions that the prophets laid out\u2026it is futile to even try. Instead, what you should do is accept on faith that the things the prophets said are true, and once you do, it will become clear to you that it is the truth because this first hand experience is much more powerful. Al Ghazali saw these philosophers claim to be free from the shackles of authority based opinions, but really in his eyes they had just imprisoned themselves in a new cell block. The confines of only using reason to arrive at truth.\n\nAl Ghazali brings up a good point that we touched on briefly at the start of the show in that maybe human reason in itself is incapable of grasping certain elements of the truth. Maybe the only way to know them is to accept them as the truth first, and then look around you and see the effects. I think that\u2019s a dangerous recipe. If there\u2019s one thing human beings are good at it\u2019s mistaking correlation with causality. You don\u2019t have to look very far in any direction in modern times to see people or things that are confident one thing is causing something, and then it turns out it just appeared like there was a correlation between the two things, it was actually something else. The example that comes to mind is the indigenous tribe throwing people into a volcano because that\u2019s how you appease the volcano gods and make them not shoot lava at your town. If you accept something on faith first, you\u2019re relying on your own judgment to make accurate correlations and I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve proven we\u2019re not very good at.\n\nHe thought they were downright incoherent. Which explains the title of his most famous work \u201cThe incoherence of the philosophers.\u201d Well the last guy we\u2019re going to talk about didn\u2019t agree with Al Ghazali on most things. Which explains the title of his most famous work \u201cThe incoherence of the incoherence.\u201d His name was Averroes. Averroes was living during a time long after Al Farabi and Al Kindi; long after the time when the relationship between religion and philosophy in the east could be symbolized by one of those coexist bumper stickers. Things were heating up. It was way beyond finding some alternative way of looking at older philosophy and finding a way it is compatible with Islam. Now Islam had it\u2019s own philosophy. They had centuries to study what everyone else had to say and by this time they pretty much knew who they agreed with and who they didn\u2019t agree with. That\u2019s where Averroes comes in. He was a little bit of a Renaissance man. He would\u2019ve fit in a lot more during the time before Avicenna when people were writing commentaries on Aristotle, because that is almost all he did. But what he\u2019s most famous for is his response to Al Ghazali and his theory of the best way to arrive at truth.\n\nAverroes didn\u2019t think either religion or philosophy was a useless way to arrive at truth, he just thought they specialized in different areas. Some things philosophy is better at, some things religion is better at. He thought there should be something like a business arrangement between the two. After all they both benefit each other when they both do what they are best at. He says philosophy should appreciate religion because there is no way people could dedicate their lives to thinking about stuff if it wasn\u2019t for the civil order that religion provides. Not everybody is intellectually capable of understanding philosophy, or of grasping certain concepts\u2026so what religion does is provide an easily digestible version of the truth, which they should accept on faith, because they are never going to arrive at those truths through reason. He said:\n\n\u201cthe religions are, according to the philosophers, obligatory, since they lead towards wisdom in a way universal to all human beings, philosophy only leads a certain number of people to the knowledge of intellectual happiness, and they therefore have to learn wisdom, whereas religions seek the instruction of the masses generally, he goes on, since the existence of the learned class is only perfected and its full happiness attained by participation with the class of the masses, the general doctrine is also obligatory for the existence and life of this special class\u201d\n\nBecause of this, philosophers shouldn\u2019t stir up trouble. They shouldn\u2019t worry about shouting out to the masses about all the problems with religion, because that\u2019s the best the \u201cmasses\u201d are ever going to do. What possible benefit can you get from that? In fact, if philosophers DO make people question their faith in religion, it\u2019s downright irresponsible. Averroes thinks people capable of understanding philosophy should carefully pick the best religion of their time period and endorse it wholeheartedly. But the catch is, they should leave themselves open to a new religion coming along that does a better job at conveying the truth to the masses. He said:\n\n\u201cFurther, he is under obligation to choose the best religion of his period, even when they are all equally true for him, and he must believe that the best will be abrogated by the introduction of a still better.\u201d\nI don\u2019t agree with Averroes that most people are incapable of understanding philosophy. But then again it\u2019s easy for me to disagree living in modern times, knowing how much more we know about human psychology and genetics. I like to think that if Averroes was privy to modern science and saw the world we live in today, he wouldn\u2019t say most people are incapable of understanding philosophy, he would say that most people are unwilling.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t make them bad people! Humans typically take the path of least resistance. From a survival oriented perspective, it makes sense. If you need water and you have two choices: the stream directly in front of you or the stream on the other side of that dangerous chasm over there, which one is more reasonable?\n\nKnowing that, if people are born into a world where they have a choice, the ethical doctrine that is right in front of them, or the ethical doctrine arrived at through hundreds of hours of contemplation weighing the pros and cons of each individual virtue, which path can we expect most people to take? I mean, you can be told by a parent or a pastor that lying is wrong, only bad people lie and if you do it, bad things will happen to you. And accept that. Or, you can think about the benefits of being an honest person vs a dishonest person. For example, when you\u2019re honest, you have more meaningful relationships with people, which positively affects you emotionally. People trust you more, so naturally more opportunities are going to be thrown. Etc. Both examples are reaping the same benefits of being a virtuous person. Both people are acting as if they are wise people. If the only difference between them is that one person attributes all the good in their life to a supernatural god reaching his hand down and blessing them for doing things right, and the other person attributes all the good to being a natural byproduct of living virtuously, I wonder, and Averroes would wonder too, why there is a significant group of people that think religion as an institution should be abolished.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the question of the week. I want you to think about the second example of truth in our episode today, Al Ghazali. He said that to arrive at truth you need to accept things based on faith first and then through experiencing the world around you arrive at truths that are much stronger than truths based merely in reason alone. Well think about that for a second. Philosophize This! Are there things we cannot prove with reason alone, that aren\u2019t in the slightest bit magical, that every day whether we realize it or not, we accept them on faith? Thank you for listening, I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_16": {"date": "2014-5-6", "text": "Posted on May 6, 2014\nEpisode 21 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 21 on Saint Thomas Aquinas.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a song by the musical group The Postal Service called \u201cSleeping In\u201d. Not a problem if you\u2019ve never heard the song before; the important part is the lyrics to the song because they illustrate a concept that is very important, for many things, when looking back at any point in history; when you\u2019re trying to understand what a particular philosopher was thinking, and really when you\u2019re trying to understand yourself better. The person speaking in the song is telling the listener about a really weird dream they\u2019ve been having lately:\n\n\u201cAgain last night I had that strange dream\nWhere everything was exactly how it seemed\nWhere concerns about the world getting warmer\nThe people thought they were just being rewarded\nFor treating others as they\u2019d like to be treated\nFor obeying stop signs and curing diseases\nFor mailing letters with the address of the sender\nNow we can swim any day in November\u201d\n\nNow, the picture he is painting in this song is an alternate reality. He\u2019s having a dream about a world where everything around us is exactly how it initially seems to be to us as humans. Being a modern human that has studied philosophy up until this point in history, we know that there are certain things that although we perceive them with the tools we have as a human being, we perceive them inaccurately because our tools are not perfect. For example, you\u2019re walking long enough in the Sahara desert and eventually you start hallucinating things like an oasis in the distance with a fountain of Gatorade. Your senses are failing you at that time. This has been the common criticism of empiricism up until this point, that our senses are flawed. They deceive us, so how can we realistically rely on them to find the truth about anything. Well, the picture being painted in the song is alluding to another type of human failure when trying to find the truth.\n\nThis alternate reality in this dream of his, is full of people that measure and see that the global temperature is heating up and instead of looking for a scientific explanation of what is causing it, they assume that it\u2019s an intervention by a God. They assume that God looked at the planet and was like, \u201cOK, well you guys are doing pretty good! You\u2019re following all the rules, you\u2019re obeying stop signs and curing diseases. You know what? You guys deserve a reward for all of this hard work. We all know that everyone likes summer way more than winter. Why do we even need to have a winter? I, hereby, extend your summer by a few weeks, keep it up and we\u2019ll see if you guys can earn a year long summer!\u201d\n\nWell to the humans in this alternate reality, this was perfectly reasonable. I mean, let\u2019s say that you believe that this planet is a terrarium crafted for us by a super natural God, the life on this planet especially humans are his creatures that he\u2019s very interested in and heavily regulates them and every now and then intervenes and causes certain things to happen that shift the direction that the world is going in. Now, if you believe that, what reason do you have to anticipate any kind of cataclysmic event on the horizon? Yeah, you have to worry every now and then about God shaking the etch-a-sketch and flooding the earth and starting fresh, but if you saw the universe as put here for you and governed by an all powerful, infinitely intelligent thing, why would you even have an inkling that it was your responsibility to affect things like the temperature of the terrarium you live in?\n\nThe people in this song are a classic example of mistaking correlation with causation. We\u2019ve talked about it before. This is another type of failure human beings run into when trying to find the truth; this has been a common criticism of rationalism up until this point, the use of human reason to arrive at truth. You got to be very careful when using reason to arrive at truth, because you\u2019re still a human. You\u2019re looking at everything with a lot of biases that are at such a fundamental level that you may not even realize you\u2019re doing it. This problem isn\u2019t something reserved only for people in an alternate reality laid out in a song, these biases are gathered based on what culture you\u2019re born into, what time period you\u2019re born into; what your level of education is. This is incredibly important when moving forward and talking about St. Thomas Aquinas. This is incredibly important when trying to understand yourself, in modern times.\n\nConsider the fact that if you were born in Athens during the time of the ancient Greeks, when you looked around you, there were certain things that just seemed, obvious. I mean, if I lived back then I would look around me and see that everything looked designed. To think that it wasn\u2019t would make me wonder how anybody could be so stupid. I mean, Look at it! You think it\u2019s just a freak accident that I breathe oxygen and miraculously there is oxygen all around me? What a coincidence that I eat all the stuff that grows and lives around me. How could you possibly think anything else is the case? Well, eventually Darwin comes along, evolutionary biology, natural selection, and although it is a very charged issue in modern times there\u2019s one thing about it that you can\u2019t deny and that is that it, at the very least, gives an alternative theory of how things could be seemingly providentially ordered, seemingly designed, but it actually is the byproduct of the survival of the creatures with genetic traits that ARE compatible with the environment we live in. The freak accidents that DIDN\u2019T look designed died off.\n\nWe have the luxury in modern times to see alternative explanations where, if we couldn\u2019t see into space, although it looks like we live in a terrarium put here for us, here\u2019s an explanation for how that might only appear to be the case. Here\u2019s an explanation for why it might only appear that God has extended our summer so that we can swim any day in November. Just imagine how wonderful it must have felt living in ancient Greek times where even people as brilliant as Plato and Aristotle saw this place that they existed in as something very peaceful. You know, they called it a harmonious, ordered cosmos. Now we know, it\u2019s anything but harmonious and ordered, a supernova can go off right next to us and were done. An asteroid can hit us at any time. And it\u2019s almost funny to think that an average citizen of Greece at the time would probably look at the night sky and see a shooting star, and see it as a beautiful light show being put on for them by the Gods and not a near miss of an asteroid that could exterminate them at any second.\n\nWell, another thing you think about if you\u2019re Plato or Aristotle, specifically Aristotle because he\u2019s one of the stars of today\u2019s show is how this harmonious, ordered cosmos came into existence in the first place. Beyond that they would wonder, why is there something rather than nothing? They would continue to question the most basic aspects of this harmonious, ordered cosmos and try to reason their way to an explanation. One of those basic aspects of the cosmos is why is everything moving? Why are these celestial bodies; the moon the stars the other planets, why are these moving while Earth just stands still at the center? Why should things be moving as opposed to not moving? They certainly don\u2019t NEED to be moving. Well as we\u2019ve talked about before, Aristotle was an empiricist. He looked to his experiences, his sense perception, processes present in the sense-able world to find the truth. When he was thinking about why everything is moving as opposed to not moving, he realized something:\n\n\u201cAnything that is in nature must be moved by something else likewise this something else insofar as it too is in motion must also be moved by something else similarly that too must be moved by another thing but this chain of events cannot recede forever. for if it did there could be no first mover and thus no other mover. For second movers cannot move unless they are moved by a first mover. In the same way that a stick does not move anything unless it is moved by a hand. In this way we must reach a prime mover which is itself not moved by anything, and all understand that this is god. \u201c\n\nNow that quote isn\u2019t by Aristotle, it\u2019s by St. Thomas Aquinas. He lived in the 1200\u2019s and is what is known as a Christian Aristotelian. He loved Aristotle so much, that when he was kidnapped by his own family and locked in a tower for over a year, he did practically nothing with his time but read and think about Aristotle. He loved Aristotle so much, that despite the long history of the church seeing many parts of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as heresy, St. Thomas Aquinas insisted that if you just interpret Aristotle correctly, it is perfectly compatible with Christianity. The quote from Aquinas that I just read is addressing what is known as Aristotle\u2019s \u201cPrime Mover\u201d Argument or The \u201cUnmoved Mover\u201d Argument. Basically what he\u2019s saying is: Look around you. Nothing moves on its own, without the help of something else. Sure, all things have the POTENTIAL to move, but for them to ACTUALLY move requires some sort of cause. Something to change them from potentially moving, to actually moving. The example laid out by Thomas Aquinas in the quote is a stick. A stick doesn\u2019t move unless someone picks it up and moves it. Just how we see that process of nature in the world around us using our human experience, just how we can know that there is no reason necessarily why a stick NEEDS to be moving as opposed to not moving, we can ask like the Epicureans did, like Democritus did, like Empedocles did, how can we explain the reason why ANYTHING in this cosmos is moving?\n\nWhat Aristotle says is that that process of asking what \u201cmoved\u201d that stick and then what moved that thing that moved that stick and so on and so forth\u2026that process can\u2019t go on forever. There must be some thing responsible for all motion initially. This thing that is responsible for motion must be the type of thing that is unmoved in itself, or else we could just ask what moved it. He calls this thing, The unmoved mover or the prime mover. It\u2019s important to note that movement for Aristotle wasn\u2019t just something changing location, like taking a stick and throwing it across the yard. It included that, but it also included many different changes that things had the potentiality to undergo. The example commonly given is that wood has the potentiality to be fire, but for it to actually become fire it needs to be \u201cmoved\u201d by something. That is movement too.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas thought that if you take all of this into account, there is no reason why things are moving as opposed to not moving. There needed to be a beginning. There needed to be a thing that initially moved everything, that wasn\u2019t moved itself. That thing to Thomas Aquinas, was God.\n\nNow this is another example of how you might look at something during an age before some alternative explanation is laid out, and think it is obvious that certain things follow that don\u2019t necessarily follow. For example, Aristotle talks about a thing, which is responsible for all motion that is in itself unmoved. When it comes to what causes movement as far as just the change from one location to another, this concept is compatible with the modern idea of gravity. In fact, the current scientific narrative is that there WAS a time during the formation of the universe, a time very similar to what these early Greek philosophers envisioned, where particles WERE suspended in space. You know, there was a phase where the gas that made up the very early universe was spread evenly across space and due to imperfections and the law of gravity, gravity wasn\u2019t equally pulling in every direction. The directions it was pulling harder in began to coalesce these particles together and then over billions of years those became stars and then the stars exploded into elements that coalesced into planets, etc. Again, somebody in 500 years will listen to me giving that explanation for how the celestial bodies initially began moving and think me as primitive as we see the ancient Greeks, but the true significance is that it offers another explanation for how we can account for the proximity of everything without there necessarily being a magic wand waved to make it happen. What reason would you have as an Ancient Greek to wonder why you stay tethered to the earth? See, Aristotle recognized that this mover, you know, that brought things into motion in the first place was a strange kind of beast. It couldn\u2019t be as simple as Arnold Schwarzenegger pushing all the planets really hard in a circle. These planets and stars never seem to slow down. Whatever this force is that is moving them must be constant, like gravity, but it is much, much more than just gravity. Remember, movement is many different types of change, not just location. This eternal uncaused thing that is pure actuality, the Unmoved Mover, to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas they call God based on their respective definitions. The significance of this is that it is one of Thomas Aquinas\u2019s five logical proofs for the existence of God. Because we can prove that their was an initial mover that itself must be uncaused, and because we refer to this mover as God, God thereby exists.\n\nThat really seems to be a fundamental difference between modern laws of physics like gravity that explain these processes and the concept of God. God is eternal meaning that it has always existed and will always exist EXTERNAL to time itself. There is no beginning or end to God. The laws of physics Do conceivably have a beginning. They exist indefinitely into the future as far as we know, but they still are much different than God. They exist within time. God could have created them as the mechanism he uses to govern the universe, but to talk anymore about modern science is getting off topic. The genius of St. Thomas Aquinas is that he managed to fuse together the concepts of Christian faith and reason. Reason, to Thomas Aquinas was embodied in the works of Aristotle. Christian faith was obviously embodied by the church. There was a lot of tension between people in the west between people that used these two different criterions of truth. More importantly, how can someone who accepts things based on faith alone ever hope to win an argument against someone who uses evidence or logical syllogisms to prove what they believe. Many times, reason triumphing over faith was met with hostility. Kind of like a certain type of person that we\u2019ve all seen before. You see it often times with a very strong tough guy. You can have an argument with that guy; you could really be arguing about anything but let\u2019s just say you\u2019re winning the argument. Let\u2019s say he thinks two plus two equals five. You can be perfectly respectful and show him the number line and count up to four and prove him wrong over and over again, and this type of person will react with hostility. They\u2019ll threaten to beat you up. They\u2019ll puff up their chest and get all intimidating. Now what this is, is them switching the fight. They realize that intellectually they\u2019re never going to win this fight, so lets switch the fight into the one they know they can win. A physical fight. Then they never have to give any kind of submission, whether they were wrong or not. For a long time, the differences between Aristotle and the church were seen as irreconcilable and the church always had the physical fight to fall back on when things were going poorly in the argument department with Aristotle. We talked a little last time about the various ways Plato is compatible with monotheism, but there are reasons why Plato\u2019s philosophy is particularly similar to Christianity. Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave talks about these lost subjects shackled in the cave where all they see is the shadows of reality on the cave wall and then through a process of reason and enlightenment, eventually finding themselves outside of the cave face to face with the sun, the mechanism that \u201cshines light\u201d on everything for us to see it how it actually is. That journey is comparable to the journey of an average Christian during this time period and people like Plotinus and Saint Augustine paved the way for this compatibility. Now if Aristotle was your definition of \u201creason\u201d, there were a LOT of things that seemed incompatible between reason and the Christian faith. But as I said before, Aquinas didn\u2019t think that reason and the Christian faith were incompatible at all if you read them correctly. There were some things he accepted on faith, but in the most difficult areas he showed that faith and reason are not incompatible, the most influential of which is within Aristotle\u2019s idea of the universe existing eternally.\n\nThis was by far the biggest point of contention between Aristotle and Christianity. The bible is clear: God created the universe. There was a creation date. You can argue until you\u2019re blue in the face about when that date was, but they believed that there was a time when it was created. The problem is: Aristotle was also quite clear the cosmos has always existed. These two ideas for the longest time were seen as irreconcilable. To fully understand why we have to look at what Aristotle used as his basis for claiming that it has existed forever and it lies in his idea of what infinity is. I picked out a couple quotes from Aristotle\u2019s physics that give a nice synopsis of the contradictions that he thought were inherent in the idea of anything infinite:\n\n\u201cThe problem of the infinite is difficult: many contradictions result whether we suppose it to exist or not to exist. If it exists, we have still to ask how it exists; as a substance or as the essential attribute of some entity? Or in neither way, yet none the less is there something which is infinite or some things which are infinitely many?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe view that there is an infinite body is plainly incompatible with the doctrine that there is necessarily a proper place for each kind of body, if every sensible body has either weight or lightness, and if a body has a natural locomotion towards the centre if it is heavy, and upwards if it is light. This would need to be true of the infinite also. But neither character can belong to it: it cannot be either as a whole, nor can it be half the one and half the other. For how should you divide it? Or how can the infinite have the one part up and the other down, or an extremity and a centre?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo suppose that the infinite does not exist in any way leads obviously to many impossible consequences: there will be a beginning and an end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite. \u2026clearly there is a sense in which the infinite exists and another in which it does not.\u201d\n\nWhat Aristotle is saying is, does infinity exist? Could it even potentially exist? When you think about infinity as either absolutely existing or not existing you run into problems. When you think of an infinity of anything physical existing you run into a lot of problems that he lays out but how bout just the idea that there wouldn\u2019t be enough space for them. I mean, if there were an infinite number of dogs then they would take up every ounce of space imaginable, how could anything BUT dogs exist because if they did then that would create a limit for the dogs and they wouldn\u2019t be infinite anymore. On the other hand, if we try to prove that infinity cannot exist, that\u2019s obviously wrong. We already know of certain infinities. Numbers are infinite, because for every number no matter how high you go or how far into negative numbers you go, there is ALWAYS a next number on the number line. Well Aristotle says that time must work in a similar way, because for every year or month there has to be a preceding year or month. For the record, as a human that thinks of everything in relation to time, you know things have a beginning and an end, this is one of the most mind numbing questions to think about. It\u2019s so difficult to even wrap your head around eternity. Just thinking about going back to the very beginning of the universe and asking what came before that, and realizing that you could do that forever. There would never be a time when you couldn\u2019t ask what came before that. That concept hurts my brain.\n\nWell this speaks to the genius of Thomas Aquinas. He was fully committed to Aristotle. It\u2019s centered around the goal of the time to find a link between faith and reason. Both claim to have the truth, but the truth said in two different ways shouldn\u2019t contradict itself. There is one truth. So the big challenge for Thomas Aquinas was not just finding a way to interpret Aristotle in a different way or tack on his own additions claiming that \u201cthis is what Aristotle WOULD have said if we could ask him\u201d. His goal was to show that Aristotle WAS right. People were just not understanding his brilliance, and that brilliance is perfectly compatible with scripture.\n\nNot that it needed a philosophical argument, but the idea of the obvious contradiction between God creating the universe and the universe existing eternally was organized by a tremendously unimpressive guy named John Philoponus in the sixth century. His arguments against Aristotle were bad, but it should be said that Aquinas was responding mostly to his criticisms which were widely touted by the church of his day. What Thomas Aquinas says is that there is a huge flaw in the way of thinking that leads you to believe that the universe existing eternally and God creating it are necessarily contradictions.\n\nA great 19th and 20th century neo-Thomist\u2013devout follower of Thomas Aquinas\u2013 sums it up very neatly in his book Providencia:\n\n\u201cSt. Thomas holds that reason alone can never demonstrate that the world had a beginning. And why does this truth transcend the natural powers of our intellect? Because that beginning depended on the free will of God. Had He so willed, He might have created the world ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, millions of years before, or at a time even more remote, without there having been a first day for the world, but simply a dependence of the world on its Creator, just as a footprint in the sand is due to the foot that makes it, so that, had the foot always been there the footprint would have had no beginning.\n\nAlthough revelation teaches that the world did in fact have a beginning, it does not seem impossible, says St. Thomas, for the world always to have existed in its dependence on God the Creator.\u201d\n\nThomas Aquinas says that God is the efficient cause of the universe. If we think of the universe as a \u201ccreation\u201d of God comparable to the way a foot would \u201ccreate\u201d a footprint in some sand, then if that foot was an eternal foot, it had always existed, then there wouldn\u2019t be a time before that footprint existed. God could\u2019ve created the universe in a way where there was not a beginning. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that humans and animals have existed from the very beginning. Again reading scripture literally causes people to get confused about what is possible. There is so much more to talk about with Thomas Aquinas, but like Aristotle and Plato, sometimes learning about it is easier when it is in relation to the person commenting on it years later. The thinkers we\u2019re about to start covering are the type of people where we\u2019re going to want to hear what they have to say in response.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the question of the week. Thomas Aquinas was an Aristotelian. Aristotle talked about how everything that exists has four causes that we can use to understand their existence. We\u2019ve talked about these before. Material cause, what the thing is made out of. The formal cause, the shape or appearance of something. The efficient cause, to over-simplify it, the thing which brought that thing into existence, and the final cause the purpose or function of that thing. Philosophize This! What is your final cause? What is the final cause of a human being? Is there some general final cause that might encompass all the seemingly different final causes that people apply to their lives? Or is it much, much deeper than that? Thanks for listening, I will talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_17": {"date": "2014-5-13", "text": "Posted on May 13, 2014\nEpisode 22 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 22 on The Renaissance.\n\nThe term renaissance means \u201cre-birth\u201d, but in order for anything to be \u201cre-born\u201d, there first needed to be a death. We can see instances in our everyday lives where there are figurative renaissances where nothing really bad happens when that death occurs. You can go on a new diet and lose 100 pounds and feel like you\u2019re personally experiencing a renaissance; the only death there is the death of your old, unhealthy lifestyle. You could even end a long period of corruption in your local government where you fire a few people at city hall and the city experiences a renaissance; the potholes are getting filled and the lines at the DMV are only three hours long. But what died in order to usher in \u201cTHE\u201d renaissance? Well the answer is: between 30 and 50% of the ENTIRE population of Europe. What died was an entire way of life.\n\nWe say \u201crenaissance\u201d in modern times and there is a pretty positive connotation associated with it; we could easily think about it in a black and white way. It would be really easy to just look at the Renaissance as the catalyst between modern times and the Middle Ages and declare that the Renaissance was the good time period to live in and the Middle Ages was the bad time period to live in. It would be really easy to look at the west during the Middle Ages, see that it\u2019s called \u201cThe Dark Ages\u201d, that sounds terrible. Who wants to live in the Dark Ages? That sounds much worse in every possible way than the Renaissance. Well this is a common misconception that I want to make sure we don\u2019t fall into because it\u2019s not that simple and it comes down a great question, one that has been heavily discussed by the greatest philosophers of all time and one that every one of us needs to ask ourselves: How do you define human progress?\n\nMost of us listening to this podcast live in pretty extraordinary times. Less than ever before in human history people don\u2019t die of preventable diseases, there is less war, more representation for the average citizen, a lower infant mortality rate, people are get more value from the money that they make; the list goes on. Barring 5 countries or so, the average citizen of every country is better off today than they were a hundred years ago and were better off a century ago than they were a century before that. Despite all this, at least in America, higher numbers of people than ever are on anti-depressants, anxiety medication, mood stabilizers; what metric do we use to measure human progress? Is progress defined by how scientifically advanced we are? Is it defined by how many people have jobs? Maybe you think progress is defined by some sort of happiness index, where progress means an increase in the percentage of happy people. There are people who say that although modern America is obviously much further advanced in areas like science and medicine that society as a whole has actually regressed from times when we lived in small hunter-gatherer tribes. They point to studies where people go to places like Siberia or Puapa New Guinea where people still live as our ancestors supposedly did and they find that they have a much lower rate of mental illness and the average member is happier and more fulfilled than the average American. The point of this is that the progress of humanity can be measured in MANY different ways.\n\nThe Dark Ages were not PURE DARKNESS in every area of human life. To think of it that way is a huge oversimplification. The term, \u201cThe Dark Ages\u201d, is referring to a period in Western Europe of intellectual stagnation and regression. The Dark Ages is how Western Europe spent their Middle Ages. But just because there was intellectual regression doesn\u2019t mean that there was regression when it came to every facet of the average person\u2019s life at the time. Most historians don\u2019t like the terms \u201cDark Ages\u201d or \u201cRenaissance\u201d because to talk about the history of humanity in terms of only intellectual progress is not accurate\u2026because intellectual progress or regress is carried out by only a handful of people. 95% of people living at the time had nothing to do with what thought was going to be prevalent in coming years. To think of progress only in terms of the thought of the time period is a mistake. So if you think of \u201cprogress\u201d as the progression of human thought then the Dark Ages was a terrible time to live, but if you take other factors into consideration it starts looking like the not-so-dark Ages. There\u2019s actually an entire segment of the Middle Ages known as the \u201chigh\u201d Middle Ages. There were several steps forward in agriculture, they built those beautiful Gothic cathedrals, but more than ever there was a feeling of unification in Western Europe because they were all connected by one thing: the church, Christianity. So when we talk about the death of an entire way of life, when we talk about the series of events that took us from the \u201cDark Ages\u201d to the \u201cRenaissance\u201d, please understand that these events didn\u2019t mark the darkest period of a period of darkness, they marked the end of a period of prosperity in many ways. The people were happy. And much like the Warring States period in early China and the beginning of the Hellenistic Age in the Mediterranean, this change from a period of prosperity to a period of widespread political unrest led to what we now know as the Renaissance. Once again, it\u2019s only through lifting MORE weight or increasing the intensity of your workout that you get stronger as an individual. And it\u2019s only though adversity and political unrest that humanity really shines and is forced to do some soul searching and make large steps forward intellectually.\n\nTo live during the high middle ages was to live during a time when Europe was so prosperous that it was actually overpopulated. They were using almost every extra acre of land just to be able to feed everybody. But then something happened that changed the course of humanity. This may be the most important event in the history of human thought and it really had nothing to do with thought at all, no one knows exactly how it started, or exactly where it came from. This event and the series of events that follows it would forever change the world and it is known as The Black Death. The current narrative is that it originated in the plains of Asia, traveled along the Silk Road and eventually found its way to Crimea where it embedded itself in fleas that traveled on the backs of rats on merchant ships to the ports in Western Europe. This pandemic disease is like Finding Nemo. People often mistakenly think of The Black Death as just \u201cThe Bubonic Plague\u201d, but it was actually more than that. Bubonic was just one form that the plague presented itself in, you also had to worry about the Pneumonic plague, like pneumonia, it would destroy your lungs from the inside out. And the septicemic plague which lead to something called Disseminated intravascular coagulation, which\u2026let\u2019s just say you didn\u2019t want that to happen to you. When all was said and done, historians estimate that around 400 million people were killed by The Black Death and like I said before between 30 and 60% of the population of Europe. This is the account of one person describing it:\n\n\u201cThe symptoms were not the same as in the East, where a gush of blood from the nose was the plain sign of inevitable death; but it began both in men and women with certain swellings in the groin or under the armpit. They grew to the size of a small apple or an egg, more or less, and were vulgarly called tumors. In a short space of time these tumors spread from the two parts named all over the body. Soon after this the symptoms changed and black or purple spots appeared on the arms or thighs or any other part of the body, sometimes a few large ones, sometimes many little ones. These spots were a certain sign of death, just as the original tumor had been and still remained.\u201d\n\nJust imagine how it must have felt to look around you and see 30 to 50% of everyone hopelessly dying of THAT with no end in sight. They weren\u2019t just killed, they died hopelessly. Once you saw the tell-tale signs, the black marks start appearing or swelling around the body, you had a week to live. They had no idea what caused it or how to treat it, it must have felt like the world was coming to an end. Just imagine how it must have felt being a Christian during this time. People today have a hard enough time reconciling a school shooting with the existence of a God, imagine how people must have felt watching this disease spreading to everyone all around them. The lives of people in Western Europe changed dramatically and you hear the accounts of people living at the time and these people were living in a nightmare. Here\u2019s one of them:\n\n\u201cAll the citizens did little else except to carry dead bodies to be buried. At every church they dug deep pits down to the water-table; and thus those who were poor who died during the night were bundled up quickly and thrown into the pit. In the morning when a large number of bodies were found in the pit, they took some earth and shoveled it down on top of them; and later others were placed on top of them and then another layer of earth, just as one makes lasagne with layers of pasta and cheese. \u201c\n\nThey had to bury people in such close proximity to each other that they compared it to the process of making lasagne. This was actually a huge problem. One very important part of dying as a religious person during this time period was being buried in consecrated ground. So many people were dying that they actually ran out of acceptable places to bury people, so they started stacking them on top of each other. We build skyscrapers to stack more office space into the important downtown area of a city, these people had to build skyscrapers of dead bodies. Now as you can probably imagine, this world that they were living in was terrifying, and people started to change. One such change is described here:\n\n\u201c\u2026Such fear and fanciful notions took possession of the living that almost all of them adopted the same cruel policy, which was entirely to avoid the sick and everything belonging to them. By so doing, each one thought he would secure his own safety.\n\nThere was sort of an \u201cevery man for himself\u201d way of thinking that emerged from all of this. People saw the horrific way that these people were dying and started staying away from everyone that was sick so that they could survive themselves. People just stopped showing up to work. I mean, why would you go to work if you might get coughed on by somebody and have a week to live? When you think that at any point you could drop dead of this terrible disease, why think long term? The problem is as a society we need people to go to work. The paycheck and stability is their incentive to go to work, but the rest of society relies on everyone else to do something productive that also helps them.\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of society right? You hear someone every once in a while talk about: \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody, I\u2019m just fine all by myself.\u201d Well unless if that person is living in a shack on the top of a mountain squirrel hunting all day, they are fooling themselves. This is one of the things that makes society work, we rely on others to do their part so that we can benefit from it and make doing our part easier and we\u2019re all better off for it. For example, just eating breakfast, you might have some fruit that was grown and harvested locally, a spoon that was made in Taiwan, a cup that was made in China, oatmeal that was grown and packaged in Kansas, and orange juice from Florida. Society is a group effort and if the people in Florida stopped making orange juice, we would have some issues. Well, especially back in these times, the thing that society MOST relies on and one of the biggest money making industries back then was Agriculture. Now between 30 to 50% of the entire population dying and a large group of people that had this new found sense of apathy about their role in society and going to work, the people in charge of these large Agricultural productions, the people that pay peasants to work the fields and make them money, they were having a really hard time \u201cfielding\u201d enough people to get the work done.\n\nSo then the faithful law of supply and demand started to take over. Peasants became increasingly more valuable as more and more of them died. The supply of peasants couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand of work that needed to get done to feed society. When a company today can\u2019t get enough people to willingly do a job for a certain salary, they are forced to raise the salary, and that is exactly what happened in Western Europe during the fall of the Middle Ages. Though it was completely illegal, the desperate times allowed for peasants to shop around with other land owners to try to make a better wage. These subjugated people were finally seeing what it was like to be a free citizen with a skill set that people valued. What started as merely a pandemic disease that led to a population crisis, quickly turned into an economic crisis as well, because the owners of these fields couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the rising cost of their workforce. This threatened a complete collapse of the Agriculture of the region, so what the governments did to try to combat this was impose a wage freeze. Have you ever worked somewhere where someone gets fired, and regardless of whether they\u2019re there or not the same amount of work needs to get done? So you just have to pick up the slack and work harder with no increase in pay? Well these peasants were dealing with that times a thousand and imagine if the government made it the LAW that you couldn\u2019t get paid any more than you do now. This wage freeze in coalition with several other small regulations and the massive tax increase on citizens to fight the 100 years war with France led to peasants banding together and attempting to overthrow their governments. So what started as a population crisis, quickly turned into an economic crisis that then turned into a political crisis.\n\nWhy are all of these events significant to philosophy? Because this was a paradigm shift on the largest scale. People began to question the very foundation of the society they had lived in for over a thousand years. These multiple crises are very similar to a couple of examples we have already seen. During the warring states period in China, people like Confucius and Laozi looked to the past to times when things were better to help find the direction of the future of society. People of the time looked to the past and developed the hundred schools of thought. During the Hellenistic Age, the death of Alexander and the political chaos of the Mediterranean, philosophers looked to the past to times when things were better to build a future that hopefully wasn\u2019t like what they were living through. Well just like in those two examples, the people of the late Middle Ages looked at their society that was seemingly coming to an end and looked to the past for times when things were better. They wanted a new beginning. A bacterial plague had just spread across Europe and killed hundreds of millions of people, and now an intellectual plague was spreading across Europe in response. The mentality of many thinkers of the time is summed up by this guy:\n\n\u201cI have turned my entire attention to Greek. The first thing I shall do, as soon as the money arrives, is to buy some Greek authors; after that, I shall buy clothes.\u201d\n\nThis is a quote by a philosopher who beautifully encapsulates a way of thinking that was spreading at the time. His name was Erasmus. He wrote his most influential work right during the years leading up to the protestant reformation. He was a Humanist. Now, humanism is an incredibly vague term. It\u2019s not like Stoicism or Epicureanism, it is a broad category that many different outlooks are a part of, but the similarity between all of them is that they look at things through the lens of what it is to be a human, as typically opposed to what it means to be a byproduct of a supernatural being. Humanism, during this time was much less than what it would eventually become. But it emphasized moving away from the Scholastic Approach that had dominated for so long, and moving towards the teachings of earlier Greek and Romans.\n\nWe\u2019re going to talk about the reformation and more historical context next time, and by the way if today\u2019s episode seems more like a history lesson than a philosophy lesson, it\u2019s because it is. Trust me though, the biggest mistake people make when teaching philosophy is just to have one name of a philosopher after another and zero context. The whole subject just becomes one giant blur of names and ideas with no real way to link the information together. We need to understand what it meant to be a human during that time to understand why there are such giant shifts in the way people see existence. The important part to understand now is that Erasmus symbolizes this new \u201cintellectual plague\u201d that is moving across Europe. During the times of Erasmus, religion was not synonymous with faith as is typically seen nowadays. In fact, for the last several centuries, people like Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Avicenna, these people applied their massive brains to the task of fusing together faith and reason. They tried to create a synthesis between faith and reason which for a time were considered opposites. Faith being Christianity, Judaism and Islam and Reason being Plato and Aristotle. They had success, and so Religion and Theology at the time was seen as a weird, conglomeration of Faith and Reason.\n\nThe interesting thing about Erasmus is that he doesn\u2019t fall into either of these categories that great thinkers usually fell into, he falls into a really weird middle place on the spectrum. So as the reformation began, the church and the leadership of the church were seen as increasingly corrupt and evil. But how could this happen? Well, Erasmus thought that the mixing of philosophy with religion wasn\u2019t a noble pursuit like they\u2019d thought for the last thousand years. He thought it was the reason why things were so wrong in the first place!\n\nErasmus looked around him and saw all the stuff going on and was like, \u201cCmon guys what does this stuff really have to do with God.\u201d There were many pardons that priests got for committing crimes that were completely irresponsible, several ridiculous rituals, one of which is where the spiritual leaders were somehow able to look at you and crunch the numbers and figure out how long your soul is going to be in purgatory, disputes between the Christian leadership where they argue about small issues that don\u2019t really matter to Erasmus like the nature of the relationship between each aspect of the trinity, he was opposed to scholasticism as a whole.\n\nAll of these things are byproducts of this relationship between philosophy and religion, and to Erasmus these people ENTIRELY missed the point. People are focusing on all of these unrelated things, over intellectualized things, when really the whole time, the point was to just love one another. It was very simple. Instead of all these weird rituals where you access God through some anointed medium like a priest or bishop, you don\u2019t need any of that, all of that is a corrupted variant of what you should truly do which is form a more individual relationship with God. He sums it up here:\n\n\u201cWhat hate required these things at your hands? In vain will they make their idle pleas, one that he has lived only on fish, another that he has never changed his sacred hood; this one that he has lost his voice by continual singing of holy anthems, and one that he has forgotten how to speak in his strict obedience to the vow of silence. Our Savior will interrupt their excuses and say: \u2018Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, I know you not. I left you but one precept, of loving one another, and that I do not hear any one plead he has faithfully discharged.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s talking about there is all of the various arbitrary sacrifices that human beings have declared are what God really wants us to be doing. He gives the example of a guy who sang worship songs so much he lost his voice or someone that is so committed to his vow of silence that he actually forgot how to speak. These people have missed the point. Theology and philosophy had missed the point. True spirituality is something that is very personal between the individual and God. This is the reason why he is representative of this intellectual plague going around, this individualistic approach that was growing in popularity. When we talk about the protestant reformation next time, we will be able to talk further about this relationship between the individual and church authority, but when it comes to calling out the people that have corrupted religion, Erasmus pulls no punches:\n\n\u201cThey think to satisfy that Master they pretend to serve, our Lord and Savior, with their great state and magnificence, with the ceremonies of installments, with the titles of reverence and holiness, and with exercising their episcopal function only in blessing and cursing. (he goes on) Their only weapons ought to be those of the Spirit; and of these indeed they are mighty liberal, as of their interdicts, their suspensions, their denunciations, their aggravations, their greater and less ex-communications and their roaring bulls that fright whomever they are thundered against; and these most holy fathers never issue them more frequently than against those, who , at the instigation of the devil and not having the fear of God before their eyes, do feloniously and maliciously attempt to lessen and impair St. Peter\u2019s patrimony.\u201d\n\nYes, Erasmus had a problem with the church leadership and what religion had become, but he had an even bigger problem with philosophers. Most importantly, these people sit around and tell everyone that the goal of life and the thing that is going to make you the happiest is to sit around and reason and to try to get to the bottom of the nature of things, try to figure out what the truth is. These people say that to live in ignorance, is to live in misery. Well Erasmus couldn\u2019t disagree more:\n\n\u201cNow I believe I can hear the philosophers protesting that it can only be misery to live in folly,\u00a0illusion,\u00a0deception and ignorance,\u00a0but it isn\u2019t:\u00a0it\u2019s human. I don\u2019t see why they call it a misery when you\u2019re all born, formed and fashioned in this pattern, and it\u2019s the common lot of mankind. There is no misery about remaining true to type.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is, how can you say that you\u2019re miserable as a human if you live in ignorance of the truth? We are BORN in ignorance of these things. When we\u2019re grown up, we don\u2019t all of a sudden know everything that is the truth. Living in ignorance is part of what it means to be a human being. And as the old saying goes, \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d. We, as humans, are happiest when we live in ignorance and all of this knowledge these people seek really only serves to complicate things and make their life worse.\n\nThe key to happiness, to Erasmus, is something that is laid out in the Bible:\n\n\u201cThe summit of happiness is reached when a person is ready to be what he is.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_18": {"date": "2014-5-21", "text": "Posted on May 21, 2014\nEpisode 23 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 23 on Machiavelli.\n\nPlease realize that if any one of us was born just a few short centuries before we were, we could\u2019ve easily found ourselves right in the middle of this horrific time period we\u2019re talking about: The fall of the middle ages and the re-birth or re-hashing of human thought. This is something that no matter how many times I read about this point in history I just, can\u2019t get over it. Life was so different in so many ways, but eerily similar in others. The people were terrified.\n\nWe talked about the bubonic plague, we talked about how that turned into an economic crisis and then a political crisis, but there are many layers to this parfait. The thing about covering something like the Renaissance is that it\u2019s so multifaceted and so vague regarding things like where the beginning was, when and where certain things caught on, and the causal relationships between things; this thing we call the Renaissance had many tentacles and many different storylines and to relegate them to a couple episodes is about as impossible as it is pointless. We will delve into many different thinkers, many times coming from very different parts of Western Europe and living through a different phase than the last guy we covered. But with each episode you\u2019ll get a little more insight of the big picture. One piece of the big picture, one piece that is crucial to understand because it qualifies ALL OTHER pieces of the big picture, is to understand this period of transition and what it meant to be human being living through it.\n\nJust imagine being born into the world and being told from the moment you\u2019re old enough to understand the words coming out of your parents mouths that you are broken. You are a flawed, sinful bag of skin and bones and there are rules you need to abide by. Strict rules. You have impulses that tell you to do the opposite of the rules, you will eventually break the rules, but luckily for you there is still a way for you to get to heaven despite being so weak. The way to atone for your sins, the ONLY way to atone for your sins, was through the Church. Through a sacrament. See, apparently God said, at some point after he said, \u201clet there be light\u201d the only entity on planet earth that has the authority or the know-how to perform a sacrament and therefore receive forgiveness and God\u2019s grace and get the ticket into heaven was the church. Somebody else could technically TRY to perform a sacrament, and it may FEEL like you have been forgiven, but God only REALLY forgives you if the church does it. Conveniently enough, the thing that relayed this policy by God was the church. In fact, they were also the people relaying what the rules were to everybody. The average person had no way of reading about it themselves; the Bible was written in Latin and none of the people spoke Latin anymore.\n\nJust imagine if in modern times we were told that we need to corral ourselves into a little herd of people, waddle on down to the local preaching hall and listen to a guy read from the Bible in Latin and we hadn\u2019t faintest idea of what he was saying, we just had to accept that our eternal fate rested on whether this guy was telling us what it really said or not. How long would it take before somebody got a copy of the Bible and copy and pasted it into Google Translate and saw if he was telling the truth? How long would we stand for that? Well, needless to say it wasn\u2019t THAT easy back then. They certainly didn\u2019t have Google Translate, but it was becoming VERY clear that this system where we just listen to what the priest says in Latin and take his word for it wasn\u2019t going to cut it for long.\n\nThe reason why is because the entire world was collapsing around them. The church had a complete monopoly over spirituality. These people living at the time were told that they were being given God\u2019s grace and that it was only the church that could give it to them, but yet they looked around them and they understandably asked well if that\u2019s true, why is all of this bad stuff happening? Why is 30 to 60% of the population dying? Why are we constantly at war? Why are people starving to death? Why is there all this infighting within the church? But In fact, these people had even MORE reasons to doubt the authority of the church on top of all this! Most notably the complete, categorical corruption and immoral behavior of the leadership of the church. Top to bottom. Not just the Pope or the archbishops, we\u2019re talking down to even the very low level priest that would be the head of a very small congregation. There are stories of how most of these low level priests didn\u2019t even know how to speak Latin themselves. So when they would read out of the Bible they would just fake it, they\u2019d speak in gibberish that sounded kind of like Latin and no one in the audience was going to call them on it because they didn\u2019t know Latin either. They were seen as corrupt. These priests weren\u2019t supposed to get married so as a loophole they would take concubines, that was kind of seen as an immoral work around. There was a LONG period called the Great Schism where the church wasn\u2019t unified under a single pope having as many as three popes at one time; they were fighting each other for who was going to be in charge. That was seen as a needless dropping of the proverbial ball and one that made people question whether these people were as anointed by God as they said they were. There was a growing confusion about transubstantiation. Transubstantiation is a really cool sounding word that refers to the process of, well, you know in Catholicism when you\u2019re at church and you get the wine and the cracker? Well these people were supposed to believe that when some guy says a few Latin words that that wine literally transformed into the blood of Jesus. The bread literally transformed into the body of Jesus. Even people back then were wondering how that was possible. Now, people have written entire books on all the various factors that came together to cause the protestant reformation, but the important thing for us is to realize that there was considerable reason for the people of the time to see the leadership of the church as not really knowing what they were doing, and when they looked around them at all the bad stuff happening to them OUTSIDE of church, it makes sense that they would ask themselves, What are we doing wrong? Why is God allowing this to happen? Let me see what is in that book you\u2019re reading from.\n\nSee, all these different crises that were going on led people to CRAVE some kind of personal spiritual experience. The priests at the time were not doing much preaching as we would expect in church today where there is some reading from the Bible and then some overarching takeaway message for the week that you can apply to your life. The function of church was simple: Sacrament. To absolve you for whatever sins you committed since the last time you went to church, so if you died you would go to heaven instead of purgatory. People wanted more than that. They wanted a new, more personal version of religion to help quell the fear that went along with the new pandemic disease crisis, the new political crisis, etc.\n\nNow, remember what we talked about last time with Erasmus, this new Humanistic way of learning and looking at the world through what it meant to be a human being; a more individualistic approach. Well when the sum total of all these factors, most notably when the religion of the day was looked at through a Humanistic lens you end up with Martin Luther TRANSLATING the Bible into German, which effectively TRANSMUTED religion into a more personal, fulfilling experience for people.\n\nThis new humanistic approach really is the story of the early Renaissance. The protestant reformation was the reformation of one religion. But really, there were \u201creformations\u201d of practically every aspect of human life during the Renaissance. They weren\u2019t always immediately evident to the people living at the time, but the culture prevalent in classical antiquity was SO FAR REMOVED from anything these people had seen, that the intellectual progress couldn\u2019t help but go through huge sweeping changes. So if I try to think of the two institutions that keep people in line the most, the two that come to mind are religion and government, and it probably doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to you guys that during this time period there were revolutionary thinkers when it comes to the proper way to govern a society. One of the most notorious and most highly criticized by later authors was a guy named Niccolo Machiavelli. You\u2019ve heard the adjective: Machiavellian. And if you knew what the person meant when they were saying it you knew that it means, this is out of the dictionary: cunning, scheming, and unscrupulous, especially in politics or in advancing one\u2019s career.\n\nBut this would be misleading. That would be like saying that something was Orwellian if it has to do with animals living on a farm somewhere. Machiavelli was actually much less one dimensional than that, but people take away a one dimensional interpretation of him because they judge him based on only his most famous work. Machiavelli was a political philosopher. Plain and simple. Some people don\u2019t like to even consider him a philosopher because he only really made contributions in the area of politics, but I like to think of him as just more focused than most. The concept that is really interesting to consider is to think of virtue broadly, and how unspecific the term is in itself. When we think of virtue in modern times, we typically think of how it applies to us on a personal level. We think of virtue and we think of things like patience and honesty and courage and things like that. Now at this point it would be easy to mistake the term virtue as meaning what the best way to live is. Sort of like a best practices template for being a human being. You act this way and it yields the best life possible; that\u2019s what virtue is. But that\u2019s NOT what virtue is, really. Virtue concerns itself with what is right and what is wrong. Yes, if our goal is to live the happiest life possible, then the RIGHT thing to do, the virtuous approach to achieving that is to be, patient, honest, courageous, etc. However, if we change the end goal we\u2019re trying to arrive at, if we for instance determine that we want to be the UNHAPPIEST person possible, then the right thing to do, the virtuous thing to do if that\u2019s the goal you want is to be impatient, dishonest and cowardly.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the saying that you have to know where you\u2019re going if you want to know how to get there. Well, that is the reason why there is no one, single framework of being virtuous. That\u2019s the reason why what virtuous behavior changes from philosopher to philosopher. Virtue to Saint Augustine is much different than virtue to Socrates because they had very different goals they were trying to achieve. Again, there may be ideas of right action that are common among people or more popular than other ideas of right action, but there is no intrinsically \u201ccorrect\u201d way to do things because good or bad is defined by a goal that is trying to be achieved.\n\nNow that said, we, as humans, have many goals that we assign to ourselves. There is a decorum that is acceptable for each one of these goals and we would consider certain behaviors right or wrong based on what we were trying to achieve. For example, the decorum that makes a good stand up comedian is MUCH different than the decorum that makes a good doctor. When you\u2019re doctor is reading you your test results, you probably don\u2019t want him to put on the fuzzy red shoes and the clown nose, unless of course he is Robin Williams in the movie Patch Adams. You don\u2019t want him to start berating you or being sarcastic or pointing out ironies in your medical history. However, you would want all of these sorts of behaviors if you were going out to watch some good stand up comedy. Nothing is intrinsically bad about wearing the fuzzy red shoes, but we CAN deem them bad when we have a goal that we\u2019re trying to achieve. The decorum of a cheerleader is much different than the decorum of a library attendant. Well, this is a great place to start from when talking about Machiavelli and his thoughts on the best way to rule a society. Sure the average person walking around living their life should be honest and temperant and things like that because they yield the greatest result for him, but the rulers of an entire population have very unique problems they are presented with, very unique circumstances, Machiavelli thought it would be naive to think that to be a great ruler you could live with the same goals in mind as the average citizen, you don\u2019t have the same goals, so because of that you have to act a certain way.\n\nHis most famous work was entitled \u201cThe Prince\u201d. This book was a handbook to a new ruler or prince, over a city-state or a population and it gave them a blueprint for how to take control and maintain stability of their empire. Stability is the most important word of all. Remember, Machiavelli lived during this time of constant political unrest. Just during his lifetime the ruler of Florence, where he lived, changed almost 10 times. You read Machiavelli\u2019s writings and it is very evident that what he wanted more than anything was a stable, unified Italy, not this collection of city-states constantly arguing with each other. See, what Machiavelli realized is that a ruler can have THE BEST PLAN in the world, he can have a 10 year plan where at the end of it there is going to be a complete utopia in his kingdom, but if his kingdom lacks stability, nothing can happen. When a nation is unstable it doesn\u2019t matter how much prosperity you might bring your people, that instability undermines the whole process. Therefore, the chief concern of any ruler should be the stability of the state, and no matter what you have to do to achieve that stability you do it, even if it is outside the confines of what the average person would conventionally see as moral. Murder, deception, war-mongering, none of these things are off the table.\n\nMachiavelli would say that people that don\u2019t understand what it means to be a ruler would talk about things like human rights and that a ruler should set an example and we should never spill a single drop of blood, Machiavelli would say that these are all noble pursuits in their own right, but it would be naive to think that a ruler can actually be like that in any practical sense. Just think about it. No country ever in the history of the world has been founded on people all coming to a grassy clearing in the forest with a river flowing through it and they all start holding hands and singing like it\u2019s Christmas in Whoville and they all look at one guy and say \u201cHe is our leader!\u201d and everyone starts cheering and things go on happily ever after. Machiavelli thought if that sounds like a fairy tale then it\u2019s because it is. Noe! Nations are founded on deception, espionage, bloodshed, you name it. Nations are FOUNDED on immorality, how can we expect that immediately after a new ruler takes power, if he wants to maintain stability of the empire that he can instantly live in a moral way? Machiavelli describes it here:\n\n\u201cIt ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Hence it comes that all armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nNow don\u2019t jump to conclusions and think that this is the only way Machiavelli thought about how to run a nation. His second most famous work was called \u201cDiscourses on Livy\u201d What is this Livy that he was providing discourse on? Livy was a renowned historian of Rome. He is best known for writing an entire history of Rome. So Machiavelli, again turning to writings of earlier Greeks and Romans for a new model, looked at the success of Rome and wrote about how it would behoove new city-states to try to implement their system of government and experience success on the level that they had. Rome, was a republic for most of the time Livy wrote about them. So at first glance it seems like a contradiction for Machiavelli. On one hand he is advocating a king or a ruler that shouldn\u2019t be bound by the conventional idea of morality and then on the other hand he thinks a republic is the best thing for states to model themselves after. There are many explanations for this apparent contradiction, some people even go so far as to say that \u201cThe Prince\u201d was a satire. Machiavelli was just showing people how these sorts of rulers actually act so that they would overthrow them and create a republic. That\u2019s probably not the case. In reality, Machiavelli was probably talking about what he saw as two different stages in the development of a state. First, a nation is founded on bloodshed and immorality and the goal of the state should be to maintain stability whatever the cost. Then, through the creation of institutions of control the state could eventually transform into a more ideal form of government, namely a republic. Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cThe Prince\u201d can be thought of as how that initial ruler can best maintain stability and implement those institutions of control so that the state survives long past his death. But the thing that ruler needs to remember is that without stability first, the republic never happens. He talks about the contradiction in the way people typically think about leaders here:\n\n\u201cHow laudable it is for a prince to keep good faith and live with integrity, and not with astuteness, every one knows. Still the experience of our times shows those princes to have done great things who have had little regard for good faith, and have been able by astuteness to confuse men\u2019s brains, and who have ultimately overcome those who have made loyalty their foundation. You must know, then, that there are two methods of fighting, the one by law, the other by force: the first method is that of men, the second of beasts; but as the first method is often insufficient, one must have recourse to the second. It is therefore necessary to know well how to use both the beast and the man.\u201d\n\nMachiavelli says that as a prince you need to be willing to maintain stability by using both methods of fighting. One is the law, which is typically used by men. The other is force, which is typically used by beasts. The best ruler is one who knows when and how to use both. Yes, you can kill people or even a group of people in order to maintain stability, even your own citizens, but it might not always be the wisest move just because it solves the problem. For example, if there are people protesting about your princely abilities outside of your city hall, that is a problem for a ruler. So, there are multiple ways to stop that protest. You can invite them inside take them out for lunch, make sure the media is there and make everyone think you really care about their protests. You can use the law, as Machiavelli said. Or you can be like a beast, round up the group of protestors, take them behind the courthouse and put a bullet in their head.\n\nNow, all three of these solutions solve the problem. The question is which one is the wisest? Machiavelli says that although the ruler should expect to kill some people, not all cases warrant that response. For example, what if you take the protesters back there, shoot them and then the population turns on you and has an uprising because they\u2019re furious about that? You didn\u2019t do a good job of maintaining stability now did you? He sums up the principle a ruler should live by here:\n\n\u201cI say that every prince must desire to be considered merciful and not cruel. He must, however, take care not to misuse this mercifulness. \u2026 A prince, therefore, must not mind incurring the charge of cruelty for the purpose of keeping his subjects united and confident; for, with a very few examples, he will be more merciful than those who, from excess of tenderness, allow disorders to arise, from whence spring murders and rapine; for these as a rule injure the whole community, while the executions carried out by the prince injure only one individual.\u201d\n\nSo in other words if you\u2019re going to kill someone make sure it contributes to the stability of the nation. The act of killing a group of people should be to prevent future killing of a LARGER group of people. If you kill people with impunity it will lead to the people hating you, which is not the goal of being a ruler. You should appear to be caring and loving to the population, not tyrannical. Killing people should not be based on ego or insecurity, that was the mistake that people like Hitler or Stalin made. Killing people should always yield a better long term outcome for more people. See, there are two ways to maintain stability: to be loved or to be feared. Machiavelli says it here:\n\n\u201cIs it better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved? It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both: but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.\u201d\n\nThis concept of acting immorally in the interest of preserving the state is not something that is exclusive to the way the ruler treats his population. This extends to your relations with other nations and the expansion of your empire. Machiavelli talks about how stupid it would be to be a leader of a state and be beholden to typical Christian morals. Imagine having to be completely honest about all of your intentions, imagine having to never spy on what other countries are doing because you don\u2019t want to steal. Machiavelli would say that to only use diplomacy or tactics that are compatible with traditional ethics that individuals should hold themselves to puts a nation at a HUGE disadvantage against every one else. And if some nation is plotting a secret attack on you, and that surprise attack leads to instability, you have failed as a leader. Because of this, Machiavelli advocates acting like a beast. He gives two different beasts that you should model yourself after:\n\n\u201cThe lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_19": {"date": "2014-6-3", "text": "Posted on June 3, 2014\nEpisode 24 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 24 on Montaigne.\n\nFor the entire life of Michel de Montaigne he was plagued by this terrible, paralyzing fear of death. You know, it\u2019s funny. I think 99.9% of people have a terrible fear of death; the difference between people lies in how effectively they\u2019ve learned to ignore it. Really, it\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. We are creatures programmed for survival, and a fear of death is a great way for us to stay away from activities that might get us killed. But ever since we\u2019ve gathered together and built these fortresses that we call cities and have had an unprecedented level of safety, that fear of death becomes much less useful than it once was. The paradigm to strive for now, is to be a person that can appease that fear of death. To achieve that level of tranquility that civilization SHOULD provide for people. This was the task of all of the various schools of the Hellenistic Age, Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism, Cynicism, people have been experiencing this fear for a long time. But when we\u2019re talking about going against processes in the brain that are as deeply ingrained as a fear of death, that task of quelling it becomes much easier said than done. Some would even say impossible.\n\nThis fear of death is present at a different level in everyone, and for a guy like Michel de Montaigne, it was probably much worse than any of us. One of the things I love about Montaigne is that there is a level of disclosure and honesty in his writing that you don\u2019t find with many other philosophers and it gives him a very unique feel. One of the things he discloses, one of the things he is most open about is this fear of death that troubled him for a giant portion of his life. He said:\n\n\u201cWith such frequent and ordinary examples passing before our eyes, how can we possibly rid ourselves of the thought of death and of the idea that at every moment it is gripping us by the throat?\u201d\n\nBut that all changed with a single traumatic experience.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how as humans we\u2019re shaped by these traumatic experiences. Most of the time the things we are most passionate about as individuals or the causes we care the most about are not things we\u2019ve reflected on and arrived at introspectively, they\u2019re passions that arose from moments in our lives when life smacked you in the face. Well this is almost literally what happened to Montaigne. The story goes that he was riding his horse IN THE SLOW LANE. Being respectful and some guy rides up behind him and wants to pass him. So he says \u201cGo around me, go around me please.\u201d and the guy tries to dart past him on his horse but instead runs directly into the back of Montaigne which causes him to fly off of his horse and land several yards away, hitting his head and mangling him up really badly. His friends rush over to him to see if he\u2019s alright and it is immediately evident that things are NOT alright and that he is probably going to die. Medicine back in the 1500\u2019s is obviously not what medicine is today. When his friends scooped him up off of the ground and looked at him he was freaking out. He was vomiting blood, he was scratching at himself, it seemed like he was trying to rip his own skin off. To top it off, the whole time he didn\u2019t seem conscious of anything that was happening.\n\nLong story short, Montaigne made a full recovery. In fact, he actually came out on the other side of the experience a better person. When his friends told him that he was puking blood and flailing around like he was in the exorcist; just the quintessential picture of PURE AGONY, he was shocked. He didn\u2019t feel anything terrible like that. He didn\u2019t remember feeling any pain. In fact, the whole experience wasn\u2019t so bad. To him, it didn\u2019t really feel like much at all it kind of felt like the process of falling asleep. Now as somebody that feared death his entire life knowing that nobody REALLY knows what it\u2019s going to be like, this experience gave him some insight. He had experienced something very close to death. Based on his experience, what was there really to fear? This turning away from arguing about all encompassing catch all rules about things and turning towards the use of personal experience to arrive at understanding about things is a hallmark of Montaigne\u2019s philosophy in every area. We will continue to refer back to it throughout the episode.\n\nBut let\u2019s not oversimplify Montaigne. Saying \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d of Montaigne\u2019s writing is a little bit like saying \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d of Led Zepellin 1. What is the point of the album Rumors by Fleetwood Mac. It\u2019s not like these artists set out with some grand message in mind beforehand and then they wrote an entire album with the purpose of delivering that message. No, they wrote a bunch of songs that have meaning to them with individual messages. You listen to the songs; you get takeaways from each one of them; two songs may play back to back on the album and may not seem even remotely related to each other, but there definitely is a single intelligence that is being portrayed through the songs. Rumors by Fleetwood Mac is not them writing educational songs; one song after another laying out an organized system of how to navigate the tribulations that you face in your relationships. The delivery method is not systematic and it\u2019s not intended to be. Well, this is a pretty good parallel to Montaigne\u2019s philosophy. We\u2019ve seen other philosophers lay out an organized system that you can live by. They usually have maxims and useful techniques to practice and all sorts of tools that will lead you to the end goal that they\u2019ve designated. For example, the philosophy of Siddhartha Gautama was very clearly laid out with his Four Noble Truths. There was a very clear practice regimin that if you followed diligently enough, you would remove yourself from the chains of suffering and attachment. Some people like Epictetus had their philosophy distilled down into books like \u201cThe Enchiridion\u201d which means \u201cThe Handbook\u201d.\n\nBut although Montaigne offered what he thought was the most effective way to live life, he didn\u2019t organize it as well as these other guys. He\u2019s actually the inventor of the \u201cessay\u201d. The word essay also means \u201cattempt\u201d. And that\u2019s exactly what they were. For this reason, this episode may seem less systematic in its approach. Because it\u2019s emblematic, of Montaigne. The essays of Michel de Montaigne may seem rambling and tangential and he may start making a point about something and then go off on a ten page anecdote about something semi-related, but they are beautifully written and to this day if someone has never read any philosophy before is the collection that I would recommend for them to start with. The reason why is because he doesn\u2019t talk about what we would consider metaphysics much at all and he talks about issues that every human being can relate to and he does so in a very unique and candid way. Sometimes a little overly candid giving me a breaking news report on his private areas and private activities. He says in the beginning of one of his works:\n\u201cI want to be seen here in my simple, natural, ordinary fashion, without straining or artifice; for it is myself that I portray\u2026I am myself the matter of my book.\u201d\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t just offer up this stuff for no reason. When you read his essays you feel almost like you\u2019re having an email exchange with someone who is one of your closest friends that share these intimate details about their life with you, but it makes you feel a little bit better about the fact that you have these problems too. Montaigne, if I had to categorize him, is a very interesting mixture between all four dominant schools of thought in the Hellenistic Age. His way to approach life is the sum total of different pieces of Stoicism, Skepticism, Epicureanism and Cynicism; plus a whole lot more.\n\nBut if there was one school that affected his thinking the most of the four, it would be Skepticism. There are parts of his essays where there is a very Stoic ambiance; there are passages in his essays you could take out and say these are lost fragments of Diogenes the Cynic and aside from the writing style people wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference. But, Skepticism is the foundation on which all of his other thoughts are based. In other words, the reason why he is able to make conclusions that sound very Stoic based on personal experience is because his skepticism led him to value that personal experience as the most valuable data. There\u2019s a popular saying nowadays that Montaigne would have loved: The plural form of anecdote is data.\n\nHave you ever been talking to somebody and lets say you tell them that you read in the paper the people at the local fish and wildlife office did a study where this river in your area has the largest quantity of fish swimming through it in the country and that through years and years of research they\u2019ve found that you are more likely to catch a fish at this one river than ANY other river in the country. And then the person your talking to says, \u201cNo! My Aunt Beatrice went fishing there one time and she didn\u2019t catch anything. That article is wrong!\u201d\n\nWell, that would be a perfect example of ignoring the data and basing what you think about the reality of the world, in this case a river, on anecdotal evidence. But it\u2019s funny; what is the data really but a collection of anecdotes? For years, some guys at every local fish and wildlife office around the country went down to the rivers in their areas and recorded how many fish were swimming by. Each one of those measurements could be considered an anecdote.\n\nMontaigne understood that the sorts of conclusions that people were trying to arrive at when collecting data were sweeping ones. It makes sense: do experiments and collect many micros to try to arrive at a macro. By collecting data, by collecting lots of individual examples, maybe we can arrive at laws or rules that are always the case. If, in theory, we could arrive at these sorts of truths through\u00a0experimentation, we might be able to use them to our advantage and understand the world we live in more effectively. But Montaigne thought most of these sweeping generalizations that people tried to make in science, medicine, law they were not useful. The reason why, among other things, is that they almost always seem to be proven wrong. I mean, think about it. Montaigne is living during a time where long held principles, things that had been held as absolutely true for thousands of years were crumbling all around him. All of these truths ended up being dis proven and replaced with another theory and then dis proven and replaced with another theory; and the whole process to Montaigne was just exhausting. Why waste our limited time on this planet agonizing over trying to come up with scientific or medical rules that apply to every circumstance without exception? He trashes people that spend their time doing this stuff quite a bit in his essays, this quote is one of my favorites when he is talking about the medical sciences in particular:\n\u201cPhysicians have this advantage: the sun lights their success and the earth covers their failures.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always an exception to the rule. Theories will continually be accepted as truth and then dis proven by another theory; that process is going to go on forever. Montaigne thought that maybe the solution is just to not over think things and to base things on the way we experience them as individuals. Don\u2019t get him wrong: he understands the value of medicine and science, but he wants to keep our focus on things that are immediately useful to us, not ethereal things like what everything is made of or what the origins of the universe are. For this reason, Montaigne didn\u2019t write much about Metaphysics. He was\u2026 just interested in other stuff more. Maybe he felt that based on his own experience he wasn\u2019t qualified to talk about these things that exist at a level of reality that he can\u2019t experience. Regardless, this disinterest in Metaphysics because we lack the ability to truly know based on experience is a great example of the skepticism that underlies the rest of his more practical philosophy.\n\nNow if you think back to our episode on skepticism you can remember how Pyrrho used a fundamental doubt about everything around us as a tool to arrive at ataraxia or a freedom from disturbance. By reserving judgment about everything around us we prevent ourselves from making negative judgments that might ail us in some way. Montaigne can be seen as a less extreme variant of this. He actually references Pyrrho several times in the Essays so it is clear he was heavily influenced by him. But instead of reserving judgment about everything and walking around not really believing anything that goes on around us, Montaigne thought that the most productive view of the world should be one where we pull from the vast bank vault full of experiences that we have garnered throughout our lives. I mean, after all: we are the catalyst for our experiences. My personal experience of something offers a very unique insight into what I might expect to experience in the future, an insight that I can\u2019t really be sure surveys can offer me or even the anecdotes of other people. Really, how can I be sure that anybody experiences things in the same way I do? This is another reason why even the PURSUIT of collecting these all encompassing RULES without exceptions about the world around us is flawed. There is a section that says, \u201cFor truth itself does not have the privilege to be employed at any time and in every way; its use, noble as it is, has its circumscriptions and limits.\u201d\n\nThe thing that Montaigne feels most comfortable trusting is his own experience. This is the reason why he feels comfortable making a conclusion about death after having his own near death experience.\n\nThat said, one of Montaigne\u2019s most interesting works is titled \u201cTo philosophize is to learn how to die\u201d. Now, he wasn\u2019t the first to say that, it actually goes back all the way to the Greeks. But it definitely encapsulates the aim of many of Montaigne\u2019s essays. Life, from the very moment they snip your umbilical cord, you are decaying. You\u2019re getting closer to death. You\u2019ve heard people say things like \u201cWe\u2019re all dying.\u201d Because for every day you live you get closer to the only inevitability that a human being has. Wesley Snipes proved LONG AGO you don\u2019t need to pay taxes. So that should terrify us really, we are all slowly decaying. Montaigne saw that people have a lot of creative ways that they deal with this inevitable death that is coming. Some people exalt that death onto a pedestal to try to come to terms with it. There was actually a very common way of thinking back then that philosophers came up with to try to stifle this fear of death and it was to CONSTANTLY dwell on your death. Think about it all the time. When you walk over a bridge, imagine the bridge collapsing and you being crushed between to beams. When you are driving on the freeway, imagine one of your wheels flying off of your car and you flying out the moon roof somersaulting down the freeway being torn into pieces. The thinking was, by constantly thinking about death, you would eventually come to terms with it because you were exposed to it so much. This is how a lot of people conquer fears in today\u2019s world. If you are scared of flying, fly a bunch around the country and eventually you will realize there isn\u2019t anything to fear.\n\nBut Montaigne thought this was dumb. You\u2019re just needlessly scaring yourself by thinking about death all the time. That might actually make your fear worse because now you\u2019re in the habit of thinking about it. You shouldn\u2019t exalt death. On the other hand, some people exalt life. They try to distract themselves from death they exalt certain worldly pleasures like glory and fame and wealth but these things run into the same problems. To philosophize is to learn how to die because through the introspection of philosophy we realize how baseless it is to exalt these things. Instead of trying to endlessly rationalize things and instead of trying to have this intellectual approach to coming to peace with our death, we should accept that we don\u2019t know. Wise people accept their own intellectual limitations in the same way they would accept physical limitations. They wouldn\u2019t come across a bear in the wild and think they could fight it and win. They would recognize there are physical limitations preventing them from making that outcome a good one and they would move on. When you remove all of this needless worry about death or life you remove the need to fear death at all. You know, he famously said, \u201cNothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.\u201d The parallel to his lack of Metaphysics is clear. Don\u2019t agonize over things we can not know, accept your own limitations and come to the best conclusion you can with your current experience. He writes in a section of the essays where he sounds like he is feeling very in touch with Stoicism at the time about instead of intellectualizing things we should allow our own nature to prepare us for death.\n\nI wanted to get an old person\u2019s perspective on death for the show this week to see if there is anything to Montaigne\u2019s theory that our own nature prepares us for death and that we should trust it. I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable going to Shady Acres Retirement Home and asking people I don\u2019t know about something that they face every day and probably have an aversion to. I wanted to ask a family member, because at least they are obligated to put up with me. Now, I don\u2019t have any family so I had to use the second best option which was my wife\u2019s grandma. This is the value you get from Philosophize This! everybody don\u2019t you forget it. But anyway I asked her when she wanted to die. And she said, \u201cI want to live until I want to die.\u201d\n\nWhat a beautiful statement. We have a desire to live until our quality of life becomes so bad that we would rather die than live. Now, in her case it comes in the form of deteriorating health where one day she will be in so much pain or on so much medication that she won\u2019t be losing much. Certainly not losing as much as if she died when she was 25. Couldn\u2019t this be considered a way that our own nature prepares us for death?\n\nNow this seems like an end point, but when I was first reading Montaigne this is where I started having the most questions for him. Sure, you remove this glorification of life and death and you arrive at a peace of mind that other people can only dream of. But how do I do that? Especially considering the fact that it presents itself in many ways, some of which we might not even be able to identify. Well, Montaigne doesn\u2019t disappoint. He talks a lot about all of the individual ways this manifests itself in people\u2019s lives. As you probably expect, there are a ton of things that humans worried about back then that people still worry about today.\n\nWhy is it that it is a stereotype for an old man to walk around naked, to dress in an absentminded way, to talk to people with no reservations. The reason why is because he just doesn\u2019t care anymore. He has lived on this planet long enough to realize that the embarrassment and the desire for respect and all the various things that motivate people to follow social conventions are really pointless. What else does he have to prove to anybody? He realizes that even if everyone on planet earth rejects him he is still going to be able to watch The Price is Right tomorrow.\n\nWell this is a form of wisdom to Montaigne. This is another way that our own nature prepares us for death by removing these pointless anxieties that we have. He sounds a lot like a Cynic during the parts of his essays when he talks about this dynamic in particular. He actually goes on a multiple page diatribe about animals and how they are much wiser than humans in many ways. I think everybody can relate to what he is talking about. Who listening to this has never looked in the mirror and nitpicked something about themselves and wished that their physical presence was different than it was. Do you know how much I want cheekbones like Ashton Kutcher or Don Draper? How many of us do this to ourselves all the time? Well, Montaigne gives example after example of people who hold themselves to these brutal standards. He says that we despise our own beings. And is there any condition that is really worse than that? You\u2019re imprisoned in this tomb of self-proclaimed ugliness. We should try to recognize that we are animals just like your dog is an animal. Your dog doesn\u2019t have a laundry list of corrections for his body. He isn\u2019t embarrassed about anything. We should recognize that the differences between our brain and an animal\u2019s brain do bring us certain benefits, but they also bring us needless anxieties, like that. We should recognize social conventions for what they are, and while we may follow them we should recognize them for what they truly are.\n\nIf I had to try to distill Montaigne\u2019s approach to life I might begin with a very Buddhist concept. The removal of attachments in our lives that are brought on by our relationships with others. We constantly strive for the approval of others. The problem with this, Montaigne would say, is that as long as you care at all about what other people think of you, as long as you care at all about whether people like you or not, you will never be able to achieve complete peace of mind. What the Stoics would call ataraxia. What the Buddhists would call enlightenment. When we care about the acceptance of others too much we are more likely to do things, not because they are the wisest thing to do, but because the people whose acceptance we desire are doing it. This always reminds me of the common thing that a child will say, \u201cwell everybody else was doing it!\u201d \u201cwell if everybody jumped off a bridge, would you?\u201d This is a good way to think about what Montaigne is saying here. We shouldn\u2019t completely reject the actions of everybody else around us, but we should aim for what he refers to as \u201cSolitude\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t mean solitude in a literal sense, he means solitude in action. We should base the decisions we make on more than just what everybody else is doing. We shouldn\u2019t be tempted to fall in line simply because it is easy.\n\nFor example, there are stoplights and street signs all over the road. We follow those stoplights. They benefit us greatly. They keep us safe on the road, they help us know where we are going, they help us know what speed is safe in a certain area. But it would be complete madness to be enslaved to those stoplights where no matter what happened around you you couldn\u2019t disobey them. If a volcano erupts behind you and lava is flowing down the street, the wisest move would not be to wait until the light turns green. Well Montaigne would say that it\u2019s complete madness to be enslaved to the social conventions that seek the admiration of other people.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the question of the week, but I kind of want this to be the reflection of the week. There\u2019s a fantastic quote by Montaigne where he challenges the way that we typically look at the world by allowing us to look at it through the lens of a goose. It actually reminds me of something I read in a Jerry Seinfeld book one time where he was talking about how if Aliens came down and looked at our society, they would have to conclude that dogs were really the dominant species on the planet and that humans were their slaves. The dogs get to sit around and sleep all day while the humans go out and work 40+ hours a week to pay for their food and pet them and they just get to lay around enjoying life. Well I want you to think about your life in the way Montaigne asks us to think about how a goose might look at his life. He says:\n\n\u201cWhy may not a goose say thus: \u201cAll the parts of the universe I have an interest in: the earth serves me to walk upon, the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favorably as me. I am the darling of Nature! Is it not man that keeps and serves me?\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_20": {"date": "2014-9-29", "text": "Posted on September 29, 2014\nEpisode 38 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #038 on Gottfried Leibniz pt. 2 \u2013 The Best of All Possible Worlds. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nGottfried Leibniz vs Sir Isaac Newton. It really is one of the biggest Twitter feuds from human history. Sure, you got the whole who invented calculus first thing\u2026and that was a big deal. That would be what people wrote about in the tabloids back then, if they had tabloids. It was a high profile, but it was far from the extent of their disagreements with each other. On many issues they are seen as two profoundly genius intellectuals who hold very different opinions that often contradict each other. And this disagreement runs deep\u2026even all the way down to the foundation of reality itself.\n\nWe\u2019re all very familiar with the Newtonian view of the universe\u2026it\u2019s shaped scientific thought since the day he laid it out. This mechanistic, Atomism where the physical world is made up of real physical objects\u2026\nWell the fact that Leibniz and his theory of this infinity of spiritual points he calls monads, the fact that it eventually doesn\u2019t hold up to scientific scrutiny and the fact that the Newtonian view prevails, it may have been due to a fatal flaw present in his experiments directly from the start. But it\u2019s interesting to consider for a second, how different science and the world might look if for some reason, i don\u2019t know what it would be, if Leibniz\u2019s monadology achieved the same level of notoriety that newton\u2019s system did. Just imagine how different we would look at our place in the world.\n\nThis is the beginning of me delivering on my promise of making sure we understand why Leibniz was so compelled to create this system of monads. His motivation\u2026the bottom line was\u2026he was scared. He saw the writing on the wall. He was worried these new theories presenting the universe to be mechanistic were going to make the concept of God unnecessary, or even worse\u2026incompatible. Leibniz was born in 1646 and when he was only six years old\u2026his father died. This left him in the care of his mother who was deeply religious and she made sure she passed as much of that as she could onto the young Gottfried Leibniz. One of the principle tasks of Leibniz\u2019s life\u2026one that he spent countless hours arguing about and working on\u2026is this relationship between theology and this new emerging body of thought.\n\nThe result of this is that in the context of this larger war that is going on between these two competing interests, Leibniz as a major thinker on one side that was trying to make peace between these two sides\u2026he ends up having a lot of the same argument over and over and over again. That\u2019s just how it goes though\u2026during the short period he was a thinker on this planet certain really pivotal issues were being discussed and they just happen to be what he used his brain on. So when you look at his Monadology, understand that this is why he needs this God centered foundation in the first place\u2026and understand that when he talks about all these special little attributes of the Monads that seem pretty arbitrary\u2026I mean come on\u2026monads don\u2019t have windows? Understand that these attributes AREN\u2019T arbitrary and that he deduces that these attributes MUST exist based on the results of these arguments that he is having in the REAL world about the relationship between God, the nature of reality and how humans interact with it.\n\nBut if you asked Leibniz for the one issue that many of these conversations centered around\u2026the issue that is CENTRAL to our episode today and one that Leibniz was probably beyond tired of talking about by the end of his life is the problem of evil. How do you explain the fact that there is supposedly a magic being up in the sky who is both all knowing AND all powerful and without limitations, how do you reconcile that with the fact that evil exists in the world\u2026that horrible things happen to completely innocent people. And when someone asks this question they aren\u2019t just talking about drive by shootings or serial killers raping and murdering dozens of people\u2026they\u2019re not just talking about human behavior or things that can be explained away traditionally with the idea that this opposing force called \u201cthe devil\u201d is somehow influencing them\u2026these people are talking about other instances of evil..they\u2019re talking about large scale natural disasters. You know, look at videos of the tsunami that happened a couple years ago\u2026just this giant, horrifying wave helplessly engulfing giant groups of children and their parents and friends\u2026is God just sitting back and watching as these innocent kids suffocate and breath in salt water and get crushed and torn apart by houses and cars\u2026does god just sit around and watch the Bubonic plague\u2026does he just sit back and watch people drown in their own bodily fluids? how does one reconcile that reality with the existence of an all-powerful infinitely good God? When somebody brought this up around Leibniz\u2026he must have wanted to just beat his head into the wall until they went away. This question plagued him his entire life\u2026and although he has one of the most famous and brilliant responses to this question it hardly went away. It\u2019s commonly been referred to as the biggest and most important theological question in societies that are predominantly Christian and one that still hasn\u2019t been answered definitively.\n\nYou know we see this all the time in today\u2019s world\u2026some terrible tragedy happens on the news\u2026there is some school shooting or terrorist attack and in the coming weeks people are soul searching and they\u2019re confused and it gets really hard to accept that despite all your best efforts and despite the fact that you and everyone around you behaves so ethically, how can one person or a small group of people do this? Why would God allow this to happen?\n\nAnd then all the big name Christian bloggers come out with some post attempting to console people and give their reasons for why they think this stuff happens. Now this type of blog post has a name, but the name was given to it long before it was ever written down in blog form\u2026it is called a Theodicy. The word theodicy is a combination of two Greek words one meaning God the other meaning just so in short it is a thing that somebody writes about God in order to justify his actions or in-actions. This is God\u2019s defense attorney, so to speak. Well these modern day Christians aren\u2019t the only ones who ever wrote a Theodicy, like I said before Leibniz has one of the most famous Theodicies ever written.\n\nNow if you have a good memory then you already remember when we talked about this problem before this: Plotinus. But let me make something clear, the problem that Plotinus had to solve was different the beast that Leibniz had to take on and the one that modern Christians need to explain the actions of. Let me explain. someone strolls up to a modern day Christian and says, \u201cYou believe in an all powerful, all knowing loving god that put you on this planet to glorify him and be happy, yet millions of people die of horribly painful preventable diseases each year, I hereby call the existence of your God into question, because if he did exist as you say he does, he would never allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nWell, Plotinus was a neo-platonist and from his perspective and through the perspective of most thinkers in the middle ages, talking about some evil that\u2019s going on in the world didn\u2019t cause them to question whether they were wrong about God existing, it made them question whether they understood how it was possible. They looked around them at all of these perfectly ordered unexplainable phenomena and they were pretty darn certain god existed. They saw evil in the world and they didn\u2019t question WHETHER god existed because of that\u2026they were just legitimately confused about why it happens and they looked to explain it. Plotinus does it from the perspective of metaphysics\u2026that evil is not something god creates or allows, it is the absence of good. Good things being the creation of this infinitely good source known as \u201cthe one\u201d or \u201cgod\u201d. Let\u2019s say a single piece of wood represents all of creation, and it was created by this infinitely good being. Now if there is a hole in that piece of wood, it\u2019s not that God created that hole\u2026that hole is the absence of his creation. There\u2019s more to his theory and if you\u2019re interested you can go back and listen to that episode.\n\nThe point is, there is a big difference between reasoning to a conclusion that allows for evil to be POSSIBLE in a world created by God just in theory\u2026there\u2019s a big difference between that and thinking that God can intervene and change the course of history, and does all the time, yet still allows for terrible things to happen to innocent people. This is commonly referred to as \u201cthe underachiever argument\u201d, claiming that god could work harder but doesn\u2019t for whatever reason. Two very different problems that we\u2019re trying to solve there.\n\nWe can relate to this. We\u2019ve all heard someone talk about God in this way during our life. You know someone will say\u2026my baby was acting weird so I was rushing it to the hospital and on the way to the hospital my car blew a head gasket and was stranded on the side of the road and I looked at my baby and it couldn\u2019t breathe and it was turning blue and convulsing and I frantically waved at all the passing cars and this really compassionate middle-aged guy pulled over and rushed my baby to the hospital and saved his life. God is so incredible! Jesus influenced that man\u2019s behavior. The man would\u2019ve otherwise driven past that person on the side of the road, if it weren\u2019t for God intervening and saved that person\u2019s baby. Whats even more incredible is that God did all this completely outside of the man\u2019s conscious awareness..I mean he wasn\u2019t driving along in his car singing journey and then \u2026BING\u2026some force possess him to stop on the side of the road and he says \u201cI AM HERE TO TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL\u201d\u2026.NO he thought he was just helping a fellow human being.\n\nWell the problem with attributing this \u201cmiracle\u201d to a supernatural God intervening in the world to make your life better than it otherwise would have been\u2026the problem that Leibniz needs to address\u2026is that we also have to give him credit for the 99 times out of 100 that the baby dies in that scenario. We also have to give him credit for the person that tries to hitchhike and get help and then gets picked up by some Steve Buschemi looking guy who augers a hole into the side of her head and makes it a decoration on his mantle.\nThe response that Leibniz gives is that it\u2019s not that God is an underachiever\u2026we just perceive him to be an underachiever when in fact we are living in \u201cthe best of all possible worlds\u201d. So to clarify a part of last week\u2019s episode\u2026when he calls this existence the best of all possible worlds he is referencing this notion that God COULD do more but chooses not to. He obviously disagrees with it. But that puts him in an interesting place. He is committed now. To Leibniz the world is NOT arbitrary. Every act of creation was driven by a specific purpose\u2026or a sufficient reason. (his principle sufficient reason is something he is famous for) God didn\u2019t just make the world KIND of good\u2026he made it the best he possibly could and for good reason. This leaves him with the task of proving how that is possible when that Steve Buschemi guy exists in it. This would have been a common argument leveraged against him\u2026we live in the best of all possible worlds? Imagine the world without the holocaust\u2026how isn\u2019t it a better world if millions of people weren\u2019t slaughtered?\n\nLeibniz argues against this in a couple ways. First, he says, to give a modern example \u2026 let\u2019s not pretend like we know for a fact that if 9/11 never happened, the world would be a better place. For example, maybe that attack prompted a response from the US that prevented some future attack where half a million people die. God could be allowing certain things to happen as damage control.\nThe second way he refutes it and the one I think is far more compelling, is that he would say\u2026we live in the best of all possible worlds\u2026how arrogant and short sighted is it for us to assume that HUMAN HAPPINESS is the metric that God uses to determine how GOOD the world is. This universe is BIGGER THAN YOU\u2026human species. He talks about how it could be just as likely that God has us set up in the best of all possible worlds\u2026but it is the best of all possible worlds for all sentient creatures. All the polar bears\u2026all the dogs, cats\u2026and maybe a few thousand humans dying is worth it if it makes the lives of these animals better. This is a really interesting argument\u2026and it should be said that Leibniz gives several examples of how god measures \u201cgoodness\u201d of the world\u2026and it isn\u2019t entirely clear which one Leibniz subscribes to.\n\nThe problem with this defense if you\u2019re a modern day Christian is obvious. We are supposedly the exalted species\u2026we aren\u2019t on the same level as all these other animals\u2026we are special. This universe was created so that humans could have an ethical obstacle course\u2026not so that Polar Bears can keep making coke commercials. So \u201cgoodness\u201d must have something to do with humans and that makes the wanton killing of humans difficult to justify.\n\nThe whole point of Leibniz pointing out that we don\u2019t know what gauge God uses to determine what \u201cgood\u201d is\u2026is to point out that we cannot definitively say that we are NOT living in the best of all possible worlds. So now, the burden of proof is on them. For someone to refute that we aren\u2019t living in the best of all possible worlds\u2026they have to prove that\u2019s the case. Or more importantly, for them to refute that it IS the best of all possible worlds\u2026they have to prove that it isn\u2019t.\nLeibniz looks at Plotinus\u2019 argument about evil just being the absence of good\u2026or the hole in the piece of wood\u2026and he thinks it is ridiculous. He thinks\u2026if god is responsible for all of creation\u2026then he is also responsible for the holes he leaves in it. He says that everything that happens in the world, good or evil CAN ultimately be tied back to God\u2019s will. But that doesn\u2019t mean he does it all with a smile on his face. This is the big difference to Leibniz: When god wills for good things to happen\u2026he does so Leibniz says, \u201cby decree\u201d and when he wills evil things to happen, he\u2019s just kind of letting them happen.\nBut why does god do this? Because he is doing his duty as god. \u201cJust doing my job ma\u2019am\u201d and that job is to create the best possible world. See, originally, god contemplated all the possible ways the universe COULD have played out and he chose the best one. We humans may not understand all the ins and outs of WHY it is the best one\u2026.after all WHY its the best may have very little to do with us at all.\nSo evil, to Leibniz, is a necessary evil. He makes it very clear that we should make the distinction between the \u201cbest of all possible worlds\u201d and a \u201cperfect\u201d world as we would perceive it. He has a whole section of his theodicy where he talks about how it is impossible for God to have created a \u201cperfect\u201d world\u2026and that the presence of evil isn\u2019t indicative of God not existing\u2026it is a catalyst for some larger good.\n\nSo this is a huge point\u2026.evil is not just the absence of good like Plotinus would hold\u2026evil is a necessary state of affairs to allow for some greater good. There is an example that Bertrand Russell gives in the history of western philosophy to illustrate this concept\u2026he talks about how, as humans, we would perceive being thirsty or dehydrated as something bad or evil towards us. So when we arrive at a babbling brook up in the hills and drink some cold, clean water\u2026the goodness of that water is greater than if we weren\u2019t thirsty at all and drank some water out of an airport urinal. By the way\u2026he didn\u2019t say it in such glowing terms\u2026I\u2019m insulting the great Bertrand Russell by saying it this way..but you get my point.\nOur thirst represents something we\u2019d perceive to be an evil\u2026maybe you could think that in a \u201cperfect\u201d world god wouldn\u2019t ever allow you to get thirsty. But this world actually IS the best possible world because when you drink the water, you derive more GOODNESS from that drinking experience than you would if something like thirst never existed in the first place.\n\nSo its not that god doesn\u2019t SEE this evil happening, maybe, Leibniz says, statistically speaking if you could play out every possible universe as god can\u2026he realized that by allowing thirst to exist and therefore the augmented experience of drinking when you\u2019re thirsty, the universe is overall a better universe. Not that it guarantees that no single human will ever die of thirst\u2026but over the long run\u2026it is a better universe. Here\u2019s where it comes together. This is why the monads have a pre-programmed Broadway script inside of them and are \u201cwindowless\u201d meaning nothing can go in or out. Leibniz thinks that God created the best of all possible worlds\u2026and to insure that it stays that way\u2026he created these monads in a state of pre-established harmony.\n\nThe monads are arranged in a hierarchy, with some monads serving other monads and these monads are intricately related to each other to insure that this best of all possible worlds remains. But this isn\u2019t where the conversation ends right? This walks us into another huge area of philosophy that is going to become more and more important and commented on as the years go on and philosophy becomes more and more atheistic. I\u2019m talking about the age old question of free will vs determinism.\n\nBy the way\u2026we see how this conversation takes us there right? This is one of the most commented on aspects of Leibniz. Here is this religious guy that wants to reconcile the impeding differences between theology and this new scientific mechanistic view of the universe\u2026and he chooses to reconcile it by saying that God created this universe in a state of pre-established harmony. Well, if God pre-determined things to happen in a certain way\u2026then how does that allow for the notion of free will? Remember\u2026Spinoza\u2026one of the other great continental rationalists didn\u2019t allow for the concept of free will he thought it was an illusion. Well, Leibniz did think free will was possible. The question arises not only of how individual humans have free will\u2026but also whether God himself can be said to have free will if he created the universe in a state of pre determined order and then insures that it has to stay that way. Can that be said to be a limit of his power? He can\u2019t intervene and Change the universe, because to do so would be going against the best of all possible worlds?\n\nWell, for the record I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a contradiction\u2026I mean if we\u2019re going to say that this God exists that created everything\u2026isn\u2019t it possible that he, like Leibniz says, contemplated all the possibilities\u2026decided on a path and just never changes his mind?\n\nThe idea of individual free will being compatible with Leibniz is still up for grabs. He claims it is but his arguments are far from compelling if looked at through the lens of today. There are a couple that are interesting though\u2026one of the main ones is that another reason Leibniz has these monads as \u201cwindowless\u201d is that they are entirely self containing\u2026and therefore are not influenced by any sort of conditioning that would support determinism\u2026the only thing these monads have to be able to make decisions is what is inside of them already\u2026so every decision they make comes completely from inside of themselves\u2026therefore they HAVE to be free acting entities.\n\nMost of the other arguments have to do with some variant of compatiblism. Now we\u2019ve talked about compatiblism before when we talked about the Stoics. This whole conversation can get lost in the minutiae real quick if you let it\u2026there are just so many different individual shades of determinism, compatiblism\u2026etc. Maybe the most useful thing to say at this point in philosophy\u2026one that is going to keep your interest is that Leibniz ran into a brick wall here. God has this pre-established harmony that at least in some capacity is dependent on human action\u2026but human action is completely free.\n\nHere\u2019s what I will say: compatiblists think that the idea of determinism and free will are compatible with each other. Determinism is always some variant of the idea that free-will is an illusion. We think we are making choices in the world\u2026weighing pros and cons and deciding on the best course of action\u2026you know whether to get the regular cheese or the 2% milk cheese\u2026but though it seems like were making those decisions, they really could have been perfectly predicted. You know, imagine some REALLY advanced computer program that knew everything there was to know about your genetics and the biological processes operating in your brain\u2026and then based on ALL of the experiences you\u2019ve ever had in your life\u2026from the second you are born\u2026you know all the experiences you\u2019ve had with cheese in the past\u2026all of the experiences with higher calorie foods with higher fat levels\u2026all of the experience you\u2019ve had getting made fun of for putting on weight\u2026even down to every experience you\u2019ve had with red packages vs blue packages\u2026thousands if not millions of variables all spinning around being calculated in your mind that lead to a decision. Can this advanced computer program also calculate and determine EXACTLY what you would have done before you did it? After all what is your brain other than just something making calculations based on the experiences you\u2019ve had in your life? And if that computer CAN perfectly predict every decision you make, can you really be said to have free will? Or do you just think you have free will?\n\nWell, the biggest argument against compatiblism by proponents of determinism is that they really aren\u2019t PROVING that free-will is compatible with determinism\u2026they are just switching the definition of what freedom is. Compatiblism is usually some variant of the idea that we are making free choices, but there are certain events or external things that we have no control over occurring. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re driving down the freeway\u2026you\u2019re on a road. You can choose to speed up or slow down or change lanes or put a coexist bumper sticker on your car\u2026but you are still going to end up at the same place\u2026the same off ramp the same junctions simply by virtue of being on that road. But is that still free will in the sense most people think about it? And by the way\u2026as we\u2019ll find out in future episodes\u2026determinism doesn\u2019t have to leave us as emotionless robots living out our lives. In fact, as I briefly touched on in the John Locke episode, if we believe we are byproducts of our conditioning, then it becomes much more difficult to feel hostility towards that annoying person at work, or even people like Steve Buschemi. Thank you for listening. I will talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n3 Comments"}, "episode_21": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 26 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #027 on Thomas Hobbes pt. 1 \u2013 The Social Contract. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nWant to begin the episode today with a little thought experiment. I want you to imagine that something happens to society as we currently know it, there\u2019s a downfall of the standing government of whatever country you currently live in, and all of a sudden you find out that the new system of government that is going to be erected is a monarchy. Now, as modern citizens of democratic societies we\u2019re supposed to be appalled by the idea of this ever happening. I mean, we saw what happened in world war two, we saw what has happened categorically throughout history: absolute power corrupts absolutely. This monarchy is never going to work, no matter who the ruler is.\n\nWell let\u2019s say we had to for a second. What sort of qualities would you want that monarch ruler to have? What sort of personality traits? In fact, let\u2019s take it one step further and go a little bit ridiculous here: What would their spirit animal be? What animal from the animal kingdom possesses the sorts of qualities that you would want in a monarch ruler if you had to live under one? Machiavelli gave us a couple. Would you want him to be cunning and sneaky like a fox, to be able to always stay one step ahead of other rulers? Would you want him to be a lion, strong, brave, king of the jungle, keeping us safe from everything? Maybe you\u2019d want him to be like one of those angler fish with the lantern on their head, guiding us through dark waters. Well in the 1600\u2019s a man named Thomas Hobbes asked himself that question too, and the animal he chose, was a Leviathan. Now, for anyone unfamiliar, the Leviathan is an animal from mythology, it is known as monstrous and terrifying, kind of like the alpha-predator of the ocean. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it, they describe the Leviathan in several different books of the Bible, In Job 41:18 :\n\n\u201cHis sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.\nSmoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.\n\nAnd I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.\u201d\n\nNow personally I think this sounds terrifying. I mean, why has this thing evolved ten horns? I want to know what sort of world this thing was living in where natural selection allowed to live the ones that could fight 10 predators simultaneously. But it\u2019s not important what I think of this thing, it\u2019s what Thomas Hobbes thought of this thing. These are the descriptions he read when he was racking his brain for the thing he wants his leader to be most like. A Leviathan? That doesn\u2019t sound very fun. It sounds like he would be almost too powerful. Well he was speaking metaphorically. He needed to go to mythology to find a creature to compare his vision to. The title of his most famous work was Leviathan, and he actually helped design the front cover of the first printing. What he chose for the cover was a giant human shaped figure, its body made out hundreds of small human bodies representing the citizens of a potential state, the head of the giant, was one man. What he referred to as, the sovereign.\n\nBut before we dive into Leviathan, it is going to be useful for us to understand where Thomas Hobbes is coming from with all of this. Let\u2019s get a little background on him: Thomas Hobbes was born in 1588 and was instantly made an orphan. Shortly after that his uncle, who happened to be quite well off, agreed to take care of him, which is significant because without his uncle as his guardian, he may not have ever had the resources to acquire the education that allowed him to affect generation after generation of future philosophers, which you will soon learn all about. He lived smack dab in the middle of the English civil war that took place in the 1640\u2019s, so he was uniquely aware of how easily the bricks that hold society together can come crumbling down. This also can offer us some insight into the world he was immersed in and how it may have shaded his views on humans in general and what is inevitable in any political system.\n\nSo maybe some of us have heard of the term \u201csocial contract\u201d. What is a social contract? Well we can get some insight into that by thinking about what a contract is at all. Well, the dictionary defines contract as: a written or spoken agreement; usually by two or more parties. The social contract that we are going to be talking about today is one of several social contracts that will eventually be laid out by philosophers and what it concerns itself with at its core are two fundamental questions: One: why do humans need government in the first place or how did people come to realize that government was a good idea at all? Two: what is the role of government in the lives of the individual citizens, or how much authority should that government have.\n\nThe social contract, is something you are very familiar with, because whether you realize it or not, you have signed it and lived in accordance with it every, single day since that fateful day at the hospital when your mother gave birth to you. But to be fair to you, it really wasn\u2019t an EXPLICIT choice you made at first, the choice was made for you by thousands of years of human civilization. But to be fair to them, in the eyes of Thomas Hobbes, it was without a doubt the correct choice and you should be thanking them.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about why. Thomas Hobbes says that in the beginning, man lived in what he called a \u201cstate of nature\u201d. Nature typically comes with a positive connotation in today\u2019s world, you know, we\u2019re going to go on a Nature walk, want to come? You wouldn\u2019t want to come on the Hobbes nature walk. The state of nature is a ruthless, dog eat dog, perpetual state of warfare where anything goes and any act of violence is justifiable no matter how seemingly unnecessary. This sort of world is the default state of man when no laws and government are in place to maintain order. Maybe the best way to picture the \u201cstate of nature\u201d that Thomas Hobbes describes is to think of what it might look like in modern times. Have you ever seen the movie \u201cThe Purge\u201d? Well, for anyone that hasn\u2019t, the premise of the movie is that for various reasons that supposedly benefit society, the tag line of the movie trailer is that: all crime, including murder is legal for 12 hours. I still have no idea why they need to make the distinction that murder is legal. I\u2019m pretty sure that is included in \u201call crime\u201d but anyway, this 12 hour period in this movie is a great depiction of what the \u201cstate of nature\u201d would look like, if all of a sudden laws and government ceased to exist. There are no private property laws, people are taking whatever they want, trespassing wherever they want, killing whoever they want if it benefits them in some way, there are no police to come to your home if someone attacks you, there are no firetrucks to come if your house is set on fire, there is no FBI to track down your kids if they are kidnapped. Thomas Hobbes paints an identical picture when describing the state of nature. He says that because there is no private property, nothing belongs to anyone. Now the thing about that is that it\u2019s not like when that happens we instantly enter a society of communal property. No, the inverse is true as well: that everything belongs to everybody. This sort of dynamic makes everything CONSTANTLY up for grabs. This sort of dynamic also makes you perpetually at war with the rest of the potential grabbers, which is, everything that exists on planet earth.\n\nHobbes describes the state of nature here:\n\n\u201cIn such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d\n\nNot only are you constantly at war with starvation, and the elements and any renegade asteroids that might want to come end your existence, but you are at war with every single other human on planet earth. You are living a subsistent lifestyle. You have nobody to trade with, there is no specialization. Your life becomes very similar to an animals life. Looking for food and other necessities of survival, constantly paranoid of predators watching you, living a solitary, brutish life as Hobbes would say. Things are not very fun.\n\nThe reason you have to be paranoid and expect people to undermine your survival in the name of theirs is that morality doesn\u2019t exist in the state of nature that Hobbes lays out.\n\nHe continues here in the Leviathan extrapolating from the inevitable state of war that we are in:\n\u201cTo this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent; that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice, have there no place. Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice. Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues. Justice and injustice are none of the faculties neither of the body nor mind. If they were, they might be in a man that were alone in the world, as well as his senses and passions. They are qualities that relate to men in society, not in solitude.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying here is, if you were living this terrifying, subsistent lifestyle in the \u201cstate of nature\u201d, when somebody sneaks up behind you, beats you in the head with a rock, steals your wife from you, kills your children and takes all of your stuff before you regain consciousness, you would feel kind of irritated at the guy. That was a messed up thing to do! Totally unfair! Right? Wrong! Hobbes says there is no \u201cinjustice\u201d when no laws are put in place. Whether something is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d really only is present when there is a goal that is trying to be achieved. There is no system of laws that people in the \u201cstate of nature\u201d can look to and feel a sense of injustice. There is no \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d behavior as we would typically see it. The ONLY thing that can really be considered a \u201cgood\u201d in the state of nature, the single, goal that is in place for humans when in this state of nature is self-preservation. Self-preservation is the goal, therefore, in every action that we take, while in this state of nature, we should strive for it. You come across somebody else\u2019s camp, he\u2019s gone, you take all of his food and supplies: perfectly justifiable because you are acting in the interest of the ONLY good self-preservation.\n\nTo Thomas Hobbes, this is obvious and understandable. This is perfectly compatible with his view of what human nature is: to be selfish. We are self-interested, survival oriented machines. We have deep impulses to slight each other in the name of self-preservation. Now, this is the biggest point of disagreement with Hobbes by future philosophers. Are all humans at their roots fundamentally selfish? Well it\u2019s not weird if you feel attacked when he says that. It\u2019s not weird if you disagree with it. I mean after all, how does Hobbes explain someone who volunteers their time and performs good deeds like helping an old lady across the street? Certainly these people who are altruistic aren\u2019t selfishly driven at their core. Well there are good arguments on either side. Hobbes would probably respond to that that people who are altruistic do so because of their selfish drive to assert themselves as superior to other people. Morally superior to others who could have helped but didn\u2019t and physically superior to the old woman he is helping across the street. When you start getting into the intentions behind why people do what they do, things can get a little hazy, but the important part is that Hobbes views human nature as fundamentally selfish.\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019re one of those people that think that deep down, people are good at their core and not selfish, Hobbes says, \u201cWhy do you lock your door at night then?\u201d If that\u2019s truly what you believe, then leave your door unlocked!\n\nHobbes isn\u2019t interested in thinking about utopias or how he would like for the world to be, he is interested in what the world actually is. And humans, to Thomas Hobbes are selfish creatures. Humans will declare war with other humans and other creatures for their own preservation, and when he breaks it down, he sees three main causes for enacting this state of war.\n\u201cSo that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory.\n\nThe first maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the third, Reputation. The first use Violence to make themselves Masters of other men\u2019s persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their Persons, or by reflexion in their Kindred, their Friends, their Nation, their Profession, or their Name.\u201d\n\nTo Thomas Hobbes, there are three main reasons we \u201cgo to war\u201d with each other in this state of nature and he just said them in that quote: personal gain of some type, personal safety, and personal reputation. Now the common thread among all three of them is that they are a personal interest that they are pursuing. See, Thomas Hobbes isn\u2019t a believer in the idea that certain people are born and they are naturally superior to other people. Sure, some people may be stronger, or faster. They might be able to complete an obstacle course faster than someone else; they might be able to lift more weight or beat somebody else senseless in a direct engagement, but that other person has gifts too, gifts that in the eyes of Thomas Hobbes, makes the two of them equal. So if the strong, athletic guy is out in the wild and he comes across a fruit tree that he wants some fruit off of, but he sees the less athletic guy put a stake in the ground next to that fruit tree and say that it\u2019s his. The athletic guy wouldn\u2019t be the odds on favorite against him in the eyes of Thomas Hobbes, because the less athletic guy has other gifts that make them equal. Maybe he is a better tactician, maybe he has the ability to manipulate the athletic guy with words or trick him into falling into a spike pit he dug. The possibilities are endless and it doesn\u2019t take much thought to see where Hobbes naturally goes with this:\n\n\u201cFrom this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope in the attaining of our Ends. And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies, and in the way to their End, . . . endeavor to destroy, or subdue one another . . . If one plant, sow, build, or possess a convenient Seat, others may probably be expected to come prepared with forces united, to dispossess, and deprive him, not only of the fruit of his labor, but also of his life, or liberty . . .\u201d\n\u201cAnd from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to secure himself so reasonable as anticipation; that is, by force, or wiles, to master the persons of all men he can so long till he see no other power great enough to endanger him:\u201d\n\nWhat Hobbes is saying is that all three of these reasons why humans quarrel with each other: competition, diffidence and glory, really all three of these can be distilled down to one thing: self-preservation. What humans naturally recognize when they are out in this \u201cstate of nature\u201d is that this constant state of war is incredibly taxing both mentally and physically. Like I said before, humans are constantly behind enemy lines fighting to defend everything from everything. There MUST be a better way! Hobbes says what humans eventually realize in this state of nature is that they could achieve a higher level of self-preservation, that is, a life without all of this constant looking over your shoulder and uncertainty, they could achieve that life if they could eliminate this threat of other humans. Hobbes says that humans must seek peace. Now there are two main ways of doing this, you could try to use your natural gifts to overpower them and make them your slaves. But as Hobbes says, that won\u2019t ever work for very long if it ever works at all. They have natural gifts just as you have natural gifts, and eventually they will escape or kill you and take all of your stuff. That hardly eliminates the anxiety caused by constantly having to watch your back.\n\nThe second way you can do this is by signing a contract with your neighbor. Let\u2019s take our example from earlier. The really athletic guy comes across a fruit tree with another less athletic guy, they both realize the tree produces more fruit than they could ever eat alone, so they make an accord. Since we are neighbors right next to each other, doesn\u2019t it benefit us to make an agreement NOT to attack each other. I mean, since we are both acting in the interest of self-preservation, and since there isn\u2019t a scarcity of anything that would cause us to have to hurt each other to get what we need, wouldn\u2019t the BEST thing to do, if we were TRULY acting for our own preservation be to agree that, \u201cI won\u2019t attack you, you won\u2019t attack me, we will share the fruit from this tree equally down the middle, and if anyone tries to come take it we can defend it together, both of our strengths combined. This really is a win, win. We get what we need and we don\u2019t need to constantly watch our backs, at least on one side of our houses.\u201d\n\nBut what Thomas Hobbes says is that this agreement, this hand shake agreement is not enough. Hobbes says it would be WONDERFUL if we could just put our hands on a Bible and take an oath that we will NEVER attack this other person we made the agreement with, but that just will never be enough. Never underestimate just how selfish humans can be, and never underestimate the evil things they can do in the name of self-preservation. Hobbes says taking an oath isn\u2019t good enough, so how can we insure that the athletic guy will follow the contract he signed with the little guy? Well, let\u2019s say there was no government or legal system in place to enforce contracts in today\u2019s world. Let\u2019s say you were buying a fish tank from someone off of Craigslist and they looked sketchy. Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t trust this guy at all, you can\u2019t just instantly transfer the fish tank and the money. Someone needs to give their end of the bargain first!\n\nWe see this sort of situation in movies all the time. You know, the protagonist and antagonist meet somewhere. The antagonist usually has the leading female and love interest of the protagonist in a headlock with a gun to her head saying, \u201cGive me that briefcase full of money or the girl gets it!\u201d Well, the hero of the movie doesn\u2019t trust this guy, why should he? He says, \u201cNo, you give the girl over\u2026THEN you get your briefcase full of money!\u201d Now all of a sudden there is a stalemate. Who gives their stuff over first? Both parties can\u2019t trust each other. In fact, whenever someone DOES hand over their half first and the other side reciprocates, my first thought is always, \u201cYou idiot! why did you do that? You could\u2019ve had both!\u201d\n\nWhat Thomas Hobbes is saying in Leviathan is that when humans get into this weird bargaining stalemate, where they are bargaining for a safer, less anxiety filled life, when one person is saying \u201cgive me the briefcase\u201d and the other person is saying \u201cno, first you give me the girl, THEN you get your briefcase\u201d, we need the guy with the AK47 pointed at both of them saying, BOTH of you better hand over your half right now, or you both die.\n\nThis person holding the AK47 is the Leviathan. The sovereign. The leader with absolute authority to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants in the interest of maintaining the contract. While in the state of nature, we have complete control over our lives to go where ever we want, take what ever we want, kill whoever we want, but when we sign the social contract, which is without question a more self-preserving lifestyle, we forfeit much of that control over what we can do to the sovereign. His job, is to keep us OUT of that terrible, perpetual state of war that we would otherwise find ourselves in. Because there was no previous moral code when you were in the state of nature, the laws the sovereign puts in place in the interest of keeping us OUT of a perpetual state of war ARE the moral order that you are beholden to. Because the sovereign is the moral authority, it doesn\u2019t matter how tyrannical or seemingly terrible he is to you, no matter how bad it is he is still keeping you out of the state of nature, which is without question, much worse for you. The state of nature is the state of war and the end that all of us should really be striving for is the opposite of that: a state of peace. The enforcer of the social contract, the sovereign, maintains that peace at all costs. Your job is to follow his laws even if you don\u2019t understand why they are laws.\n\nThere are a lot of examples of this. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re driving down the highway and you come across a sign that says \u201cspeed reduced to 15 mph\u201d. and you say \u201cCOME ON! I\u2019m not slowing down. This city is ridiculous, they\u2019re overly bureaucratic, completely overbearing, just trying to nickel and dime the seconds of my life away so that they can\u2026\u201d Then you hit a little kid that was playing in the middle of the road and you couldn\u2019t stop in time. Just imagine how angry the parents of that kid would be. Hobbes says you may not understand why the laws are put in place, but because you benefit from the fruits of society, you should follow the laws of the sovereign because they are meant to keep the peace, they are meant to prevent us from declaring war on each other. Government is a necessary evil to Hobbes. The sovereign is the way we can insure that humans are safe and can pursue things that further benefit and preserve human life.\n\nOnce we are in this social contract, once we have established that self-preservation is the only thing that we can really draw a moral compass from, Hobbes says that because we are reasoning creatures, that if we use our ability to reason and think about what behavior would yield the greatest quality of self-preservation, we naturally arrive at certain principles. This is why the collection of them is aptly named \u201cNatural Law\u201d. There are many earlier and later interpretations of natural law, but Hobbes is unique in that they are so closely tied to his social contract. The idea is simple: if the main goal is self-preservation, then any act that is destructive to yourself in any way in the long term, is bad. Any act that is truly helpful to you, is good. These good and bad actions are not always immediately evident to us, but Hobbes says these things are known innately by all and if we use our ability to reason well; Natural Law is ultimately what follows as a set of fundamentals to live by.\nThe first one is familiar:\n\n\u201cThat every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he can hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps and advantages of Warre. The first branch of which Rule, containeth the first, and Fundamental Law of Nature; which is, to seek Peace, and follow it.\u201d\n\nBy using reason we arrive at the idea that to TRULY act in the interest of self-preservation, we must seek peace. Hobbes lays out 19 different laws that make up his Natural Law. Most of them are pretty obvious and straight forward and I highly recommend you read through them before next episode, I\u2019ll have them on the page for this episode on the website. The reason why, is because to understand the true significance of this natural law, we need to dive deeper into Hobbes and his view of what humans are. Maybe a good way to think of the social contract is by comparing it to a football game. The monarch appointed to uphold peace is kind of like the quarterback. We, as citizens, are like the players on the field and Hobbes\u2019 natural law is like the playbook that keeps us running our route and not colliding with other players on the field.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_22": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 27 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #028 Thomas Hobbes pt. 2. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo as we get more and more into this period of philosophy; as we get more and more into the period when we actually have concrete things to read by all of these various philosophers, it is very difficult for the show to not start feeling exciting for me. See, previously we\u2019ve had very little to go on. We\u2019ve had fragments to read that experts have interpreted, or we\u2019ve had a translation of a translation that makes reading some parts of the work difficult. But now we\u2019re starting to have entire bodies of work that not only give us more stuff to talk about with each guy, but a lot of this stuff are things that have directly affected me.\n\nThomas Hobbes and his Leviathan is a beautiful work with all sorts of messages woven through it, and one of these messages that stuck with me when I first read it was about the nature of fear. This is something that I think a lot of people can relate to\u2026so I first read Leviathan when I was 16 years old, and without going too much into it, because of situations that I found myself in throughout my life I looked at the world as being a much more hostile place than it actually was. I was a scared kid and my behavior reflected it. I would be sitting in a coffee shop watching the people that came in, being hyper-vigilant, checking to see if there were bulges coming out of their jacket in case if they came into that Starbucks ready to open fire on all the innocent people drinking coffee. I was scared about ridiculous things; like I was scared of flying. I had these visions of the captain and all the stewardesses doing a conga line in the cockpit of the plane while were flying directly into the side of a mountain. I was scared that some hydraulic component was going to fail or that somebody was going to hijack the flight.\n\nBottom line, there was no real, substantive reason to fear any of this stuff and I always found some way that other people were going to try to hurt me. This fear pervaded every single other aspect of my life. The worst part about it all is that I FULLY recognized it. I remember explicitly thinking, because I had just finished reading the Enchiridion by Epictetus right before Hobbes and with his time spent as a slave early in his life and how that experience flavored a lot of his philosophy, I remember acknowledging that it was absolutely POINTLESS to worry about any of this stuff and how stupid am I for worrying about it. But I couldn\u2019t stop! These patterns of thought were so DEEPLY ingrained that merely being conscious of how pointless it all was didn\u2019t do anything. Now, this episode is not titled, \u201cConfessions of a previously neurotic person.\u201d This fear is obviously much more extreme than most people face, but the patterns of thought are not entirely different and I think everybody listening to this has some irrational fear that Hobbes can give you some insight on.\n\nBeing so young and having these irrational fears and feeling enslaved to them, I had this feeling like I was needlessly putting myself in Hobbes\u2019s state of nature that we talked about last time. I think when you recognize that you have an irrational fear, yet despite recognizing it you still can\u2019t stop it, it is easy to get frustrated with it. What I started to do is hate fear in general. Now, at the time I defined fear or anxiety as any anticipation of some negative future outcome and the distress caused by that. The solution for these irrational fears, up until I read Thomas Hobbes was just to try to eliminate fear completely. Fear was the enemy and was pointless in modern civilized society, lets try to be the most zen Buddhist monk on planet earth.\n\nBut I learned a huge lesson by reading the Leviathan. One of the main recurring concepts that Hobbes brings up throughout the Leviathan is the different ways that fear motivates and effects us. Let\u2019s think about it in the most obvious and physical sense: When you\u2019re stranded out in the woods and you\u2019re trying to survive, when you\u2019re in the state of nature, what motivates you to not sit around on a tree stump all day, but to try to find some berries or lasso yourself a deer or something? Hobbes lays out multiple things that can all be distilled down to self-preservation, not the least of which is a fear of scarcity or a fear for your own safety. That same fear that saves your life in many of the situations where you might be killed or get months of work stolen from you, is the same fear that eventually washes over you like a tidal wave. That same fear completely takes over your life and it is so devastating and so terrible that you forfeit much of your freedom to a sovereign leader just to be able to escape it.\n\nSee, fear to Thomas Hobbes, is a little bit like Nyquil. If you are experiencing cold symptoms and you want to get rid of them, you can take a cap full of Nyquil before bedtime and sleep pretty well. You drink the entire bottle of Nyquil and you\u2019re probably not waking up in the morning. But is Nyquil intrinsically bad because it can cause you harm? Well, no of course not, and just like Nyquil, fear shouldn\u2019t be seen as something intrinsically bad either. This was life changing for me when I thought about it. Think about it: fear really does help us in small doses. Just imagine yourself walking around the world with complete impunity. Zero fear of anything happening to you. You\u2019d probably look like Mr. Magoo. Not scared of any cars hitting you, not scared of intruding on other people personal space. You wouldn\u2019t want to be completely fearless, but you also wouldn\u2019t want to walk around terrified of everything that has a very small chance of happening that you really have no control over anyway. You shouldn\u2019t feel stupid or beat yourself up for having irrational fears or not being able to stop the mental state of fear entirely. In fact, fear is what has gotten you this far to begin with. We should be proud of some fear, and if you think about it, it really is a good thing that you are a forward thinking person. This gave me a tremendous amount of acceptance. When I started viewing my irrational fear as not a part of my naive brain that was short circuiting, but a useful portion of my brain that was working overtime, Hobbes not only changed the way I saw fear, but the way I saw almost every other mental state.\n\nFor example, whenever you talk to people, you probably have certain objectives. You don\u2019t want to offend the person, you don\u2019t want to say something mean about something they are insecure about, you want to say something the person is interested in. But this self-censorship is another example of something that can be useful to us in small doses but when taken to an extreme can be detrimental. When we apply it to Hobbes\u2019s idea of fear, Hobbes would say that you certainly don\u2019t want to speak with impunity, or not censor yourself at all, if you do you are going to say stupid stuff. People are going to get mad at you for not thinking before you speak. But if you take that censorship too far then you are stuck in a sort of analysis paralysis. You stumble over your words, you never really convey the points you want to.\n\nThis same dynamic applies to most activities that we could find ourselves doing. And while moderation in all things is no where near revolutionary, the idea of understanding that these relics of our evolutionary past are not intrinsically bad is very useful. Hobbes would advise that we shouldn\u2019t artificially create a state of nature in our lives when none exists. After all, we signed the social contract. This is the insight that really helped me get past a lot of my irrational fears, and they all came to a head on a single day in my life. I had just finished reading the Leviathan so all of these ideas were fresh in my mind, and not only did this crazy experience show me first hand how the way I was looking at fear was drastically incorrect, but it also is a great representation of the next thing we\u2019re going to talk about which is why Thomas Hobbes has a different view of the best way to make scientific progress and why he thinks Francis Bacon is off-base. I\u2019ll never forget this moment it was so ridiculous.\n\nSubway, the restaurant not a station.\n\nPart of Francis Bacon\u2019s idea of how to arrive at scientific progress had to do with conducting experiments using our own human experience. Thomas Hobbes didn\u2019t feel the same way for reasons that will be familiar to us. I remember when I used to live next door to some Mormon people who came over and tried to convert me on a regular basis, a question they asked me was, if you were on trial for murder, what is the one type of evidence that you would want on your side more than anything else? I said, video evidence? And they said, NO! Eye-witness testimony! And I said, that is the worst kind of evidence. Human experience is very shaky, multiple people can all experience the same event and have very different accounts of what actually took place. Not only do biases that we hold prevent us from seeing reality, but we are gathering evidence through flawed senses to begin with. These things that make eye-witness testimony unreliable are what Francis Bacon would call the idols of the mind. Thomas Hobbes would call them the reason why we need a better way to arrive at knowledge and what Hobbes says in the Leviathan is that our method should be more centered around language than human experience.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cFor though the nature of that we conceive, be the same; yet the diversity of our reception of it, in respect of different constitutions of body, and prejudices of opinion, gives everything a tincture of our different passions. And therefore in reasoning, a man must take heed of words; which besides the signification of what we imagine their nature, have a signification also of the nature, disposition, and interest of the speaker.\u201d\n\nTo understand where he is coming from, let\u2019s talk about the Leviathan for a second. Thomas Hobbes is in a sort of scientific coalition with Francis Bacon. Both he and Bacon represent this shift from the humanistic way of thinking that sparked the Renaissance into a more scientific approach. Hobbes lived as a contemporary of people like Galileo, people that are seen as the fathers of the scientific revolution. Because of this, he has a tremendous amount of reverence for the process used to arrive at scientific and mathematical proofs.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cIn Geometry (which is the onely Science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow upon mankind), men begin at settling the significations of their words; which settling of significations, they call Definitions; and place them at the beginning of their reckoning.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the very beginning when mathematics didn\u2019t exist; humans needed to look at the world and arrive at first principles. Fundamental concepts that can be obviously agreed upon that we can then base further progress on. For example, some guy somewhere initially recognized that One rock added to One rock gives you two rocks. Two rocks and two rocks equal four rocks. You can add rocks or take away rocks\u2026then you can look at this triangle shaped thing on the ground and see that this side is 3 rocks long, this side is 4 rocks long, so because this angle is ninety degrees, this side has to be five rocks long. From these sorts of first principles we can extrapolate from them and arrive at more complicated concepts, but those more complicated concepts are reliable because they are soundly based on the first principles.\n\nHobbes admires this way of reasoning so much, that he lays out his Leviathan in a very similar way. The entire Leviathan which is multiple books long, the first book having about 15 chapters, and for the entire thing he is walking us down this path of reason based on the principles he has already laid out. For instance, the first chapter of the Leviathan is centered around explaining how and why we sense and form thoughts and ideas. Then from there he goes on to say that through reason we arrive at the stage where we use speech as a means to convey these ideas to others and be able to record them for future thoughts to be based on.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cThe Use and End of Reason, is not the finding of the summe, and truth of one, or a few consequences, remote from the first definitions, and settled signification of names; but to begin at these; and proceed from one consequence to another. For there can be no certainty of the last Conclusion, without a certainty of all those Affirmation and Negations, on which it was grounded, and inferred.\u201d\n\nAnyway, so the Leviathan is a philosophical work structured not unlike something a scientist or mathematician would make. By using this way of reasoning and being so scientifically minded in the first place, he produces a really unique body of work. He eventually says, that everything in the entire universe is made of physical matter. No exceptions. Each and everything thing has dimensions, and if we talk about a substance that doesn\u2019t have dimensions then it does not exist at all. But this raises a very obvious question for people in Hobbes\u2019 day. How can he explain things that we know exist, but we don\u2019t perceive dimensions of any sort?\n\nWell, Hobbes\u2019 explanation is that these things DO exist in a physical form, but who said that just because something exists in a physical form that our senses need to necessarily be able to see it? Humans are a purely physical being as well. We are machines made of bones, skin, flesh and blood, just like all the other animals in the world, and what we should take from this is that we have components, like those of a machine that are not perfect. No matter how much arguing or discourse happens to try to arrive at truth, we still are fighting a losing battle if we are trying to arrive at knowledge through our senses. He arrives at what he thinks is a much better way of arriving at what we would call science:\n\n\u201cReason is . . . attayned by Industry; first in apt imposing of Names; and secondly by getting a good and orderly Method in proceeding from the Elements, which are Names, to Assertions made by Connexion of one of them to another; and so to Syllogisms, which are the Connexions of one Assertion to another, till we come to a knowledge of all the Consequences of names appertaining to the subject in hand; and that is it, men call SCIENCE.\u201d\n\nHobbes describes science as the knowledge of all of the consequences of words. Hobbes saw the same problems with human experience that Francis Bacon did, but he thought they weren\u2019t idols of the mind that could be controlled, he thought that our knowledge should be based on things that were more secure and trustworthy. What Hobbes is talking about is what we talked about in the Francis Bacon episode. When I say microphone, a different image of microphone comes up in the head of everybody listening. But if we are trying to arrive at scientific principles about the microphone that I am talking about, how can we ever accurately do that unless if we have a word, or a super specific way to describe THIS PARTICULAR MICROPHONE. Sure, we have adjectives. I can say a black studio microphone with a pop filter, I can even say that brand name and model number, but it still wouldn\u2019t be nearly trustworthy enough. Hobbes thinks that as a society we need to sit down and define EXACTLY what everything is. A good way to think about it is that Hobbes wants us to walk around and make the ENTIRE WORLD one of those Ikea sample rooms where you can look at any particular piece from the room and it has a serial number attached to it.\n\nNow you may be saying, OK this is great if you\u2019re a scientist, but how does this have anything to do with me in my everyday life? This problem of different words conjuring up different images in people\u2019s heads is a HUGE problem that can easily lead to a misunderstanding. If you\u2019re a guy out on the Golf course driving around on the golf cart at the country club and your wife calls you and says \u201cWhere are you?\u201d and you say I\u2019m at the club. Well she could easily start freaking out! At the club? Are you dancing with other women? Are you doing drugs? No! I didn\u2019t say In DA club\u2026I said at the club! The country club!\n\nThese sort of misunderstandings based on language might only be a temporary inconvenience in our personal lives, but when it comes to arriving at scientific first principles that we will base all of our future knowledge on, you can see how what\u2019s at stake changes how accepting people might be about human experience.\n\nThese fundamental problems lead to fundamental disagreements. Disagreements that Hobbes thinks do nothing but needlessly divide humans from each other and only serve to challenge the preservation of peace that we aim for with the social contract. So these misunderstandings that we have are not just things that get you into an argument with your wife, they are obstacles when trying to maintain the peace provided by the social contract an Hobbes thinks that his method helps to prevent these misunderstandings from happening.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_23": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 28 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #028 on Descartes pt. 1. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nRene Descartes is one of these people whose reputation precedes him so much that to dive right into the episode and start talking about his life would be a little cavalier for me. He\u2019s one of those names from philosophy that even people that have little to no experience trudging miserably through philosophical treatises, pretty much everybody has a little bit of an idea of who he was. Most people I\u2019ve directly spoken to typically can identify him as the guy that said \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d. Maybe you\u2019re listening to this trying to figure out what that even means. But Descartes is much more than just this single sentence. He is often credited as being the father of modern philosophy. To truly understand why he is so influential, I think it is important to talk about his life and the time period he was living through.\n\nWhen you just take the sentence at face value \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d What is that even saying? It sounds like the most painfully obvious statement in the world to a modern layperson. I mean, this is how dumb they were back then? It took them thousands of years just to figure out that they were thinking?\n\nWell, no. Not exactly. I suppose the best way to begin is to say something that we\u2019ve touched on many times before in this podcast: The world today is very different than the world back then. People were lost and confused. It\u2019s pretty easy to understand why; just think about what they\u2019ve been through recently. Things weren\u2019t always this chaotic for these people. They used to know everything. For a long time, Humanity was the smartest guy he knew. There were a lot of things that EVERYBODY thought they knew for certain but then that came crashing down in a big way. In multiple different ways. We\u2019ve seen the Protestant Reformation where the implementation of the religion of an entire millennium came crashing down. People were told this stuff was the word of God; the way the church did things was endorsed by God; the rituals you performed earned you favor with God. For a thousand years these people were told that this stuff was infallible. And it better be, considering that your eternal fate is at stake. I mean, if you believed that an omniscient, omnipotent God laid out a set of behavioral restrictions for you to follow centuries ago in a language you can\u2019t speak, then you need to be pretty certain about what\u2019s expected of you because it\u2019s not exactly easy for you to get the guy on the phone and ask for some clarifications on all this stuff.\n\nThe one path, the one correct set of behaviors that actually earned you a place in God\u2019s kingdom instead of etching your name into the charred walls of the damned, these behaviors changed drastically with the protestant reformation. And as an average person living at the time was there anything else you needed to be more sure about than that?\n\nAlright so just imagine living back then. How terrified would you be? How can you know for certain that you are going to heaven? What if the way these people told you was the way to earn your salvation, what if this whole time you had been doing it wrong. You\u2019ve thought this whole time that you and God are on pretty good terms, but what if you\u2019ve been doing it wrong all along? What if this is the reason why bad stuff is still happening to you? What if this is the reason you got that flat tire the other day? And then once you decide that the church authority has been misrepresenting this stuff, how can you be confident in what replaces it? How do you know THAT stuff is the correct way to earn your spot in the club? Can we ever interpret the words of God written down by the select few chosen people and arrive at a system that we KNOW is accurate? With COMPLETE certainty. Can we? I want you to remember this question.\n\nThere were other entire areas of thought that were being called into question at the time. For example, Scholasticism, the dialectical method of reasoning and education that was dominant throughout the entire Middle Ages that was slowly being overthrown by the new Humanistic way of looking at things which really wasn\u2019t that new because it was a hearkening back to classical antiquity. People had started to question the role of government in the individuals life. Was this feudal system that we had used for so long where a large peasant class lives a symbiotic lifestyle with overlords the best way to do things, or should we revolt and try to overthrow this outdated system. Concepts that were older than the new testament itself were being shattered. The Ptolemic model of the universe with the earth at the center and the sun and the rest of the celestial bodies revolving around us; it was becoming very clear that it wasn\u2019t true. Copernicus came out with On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres, Galileo was working on a mathematical approach to physics. That was thrown out the window.\n\nFor the longest time, Humans thought they were the smartest guy at the party. They thought they had everything figured out. But much like that guy at the party that talks really loud and is overconfident and thinks he knows everything, it just takes someone with a marginal amount of critical thinking to ask him the right questions to make him realize that he might not know as much as he thought. Socrates comes in and asks him a question and his voice gets a little softer and he\u2019s a little less confident. Then he figures out something else is completely wrong and he gets a little more timid. Well eventually humanity became Michael Cera. This stuff we thought we were SO CERTAIN about for SO LONG is garbage. What do we do now?\n\nAlright, let\u2019s start over, let\u2019s try to figure everything out again, but this time let\u2019s try to base our knowledge on something a whole lot more substantive than we did last time. There are all different kinds of people emerging on the scene now. There\u2019s a group of people that say, like the question people asked about religion truth, can we know anything for certain? Maybe we can\u2019t! But then on the other hand there\u2019s this group of people out there like Francis Bacon that think not only CAN we arrive at certain knowledge, but it is the savior of humanity! It\u2019s gonna solve all of humanity\u2019s problems! We will be living in a utopia! There are other people out there that think maybe it wont solve all of humanities problems, but it seems possible to find a SINGLE method that can unite all of the different sciences into one. A single method to arrive at scientific truths, which would obviously speed things up drastically.\n\nWhat we see emerging in the scientific approaches of Thomas Hobbes and Francis Bacon is this search. But nobody is satisfied with what they have found yet. What emerges from these people is one of the most famous divides in the history of philosophy and the man that started it\u2026the man that put his stake in the ground for people to oppose was Rene Descartes. This famous rivalry of thinkers poised on different sides of a single issue brought us so many brilliant ideas and insights that it is what we are going to be talking about for a while. I\u2019m talking about the famous divide between the continental rationalists and the British empiricists.\n\nWe know what rationalism and empiricism are. Rationalism is the idea that knowledge can be arrived at through the use of reason. Empiricism which is that knowledge has to be arrived at through sense experience. These can be seen as the two premises from which people argued in this age of confusion to try to arrive at knowledge that is more trustworthy than what we had before. This famous divide in thinking goes like this, although some people make slight adjustments: The three big British Empiricists were John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume; the three big continental rationalists were Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, but there were some other thinkers thrown in there as well that we are certainly going to talk about. Some people lump Immanuel Kant into the rationalists, some people say he was the guy who managed to fuse together the two approaches, either way he is the climax of this famous divide between the continental rationalists and the British empiricists.\n\nBut Descartes started it all. It\u2019s funny. The best way to understand where Descartes was coming from is to think of this guy\u2026this guy that throughout their life has been conditioned to have the most extreme, oversimplified viewpoints you have ever met. But I\u2019m not talking about Descartes when I say that, I am talking about who Descartes is responding to in his work\u2026this guy with the oversimplified viewpoints represents the entire human race.\n\nThis is the reason I got into philosophy in the first place. I noticed that I was scared and so was everybody else around me. And really, who can blame them? There is no users manual for living as a human being on this planet! There\u2019s no community college class you can go to that teaches you the way everything truly is. In fact, you can go to school for 10 years and learn about one subject and AT BEST you are an expert in one tiny little sliver of this incredibly diverse, complicated world. And when things are diverse and complicated they can easily become overwhelming to people. When things are overwhelming, we try to simplify them.\n\nAs a young whippersnapper, I recognized I was young and stupid. I looked around me and saw that pretty much everyone I had ever met has some black and white way of looking at certain issues that may help them FEEL like they are an expert in the field, but really they\u2019re just as confused as I was. They just were willing to mask their uncertainty with complacency. I mean, you see it all the time: This particular race of people are ruining the world. Religion is ruining the world, Democrats are ruining the world. And this is just one form of it. You ask most people what their most firmly held conviction is\u2026what is the thing that you believe in the most and it doesn\u2019t take many questions for them to see that it might not be that simple. Francis Bacon has a quote from during this time period where he said \u201cNothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.\u201d\n\nThe world is not black and white. There is black and white, but then there are about a million different shades of grey in between them where reality always lies and the last thing I wanted to do as a young adult is fall into this trap simply because it was easy for me to do it. For some reason I was willing to admit to myself that I was a dumb kid. I was willing to admit that I didn\u2019t know anything.\n\nWell in this example, Descartes represents this way of thinking and the conditioned beliefs of humanity during his time period are represented by this over-the-top extremely oversimplified guy talking really loud at a party. Just imagine a guy that was born into a really strange household. His parents are good parents, they engage him a lot and try to educate him about the world the best they can, but they have a really oversimplified, unrealistic view of the world. Through years and years of conditioning, this guy becomes this cocktail of black and white views. You can insert your favorite ones here: He\u2019s a racist, doomsday prepper, probably believes in some sort of reptilian shape shifters at the head of our government\u2026take your pick. Well once that guy is that far off the rails with oversimplified views, once that guy has a criterion of truth that is THAT easily met, lets say we had to prescribe some method for him to be brought back to reality, what would he have to do?\n\nWell this is the problem Descartes was faced with back in his time. Thinking lazy is what got us into trouble in the first place. Europe got so far off the rails with all the things we THOUGHT we knew so well because it had a criterion of truth that was shaky. Descartes thought that in order for us to arrive at certain knowledge that was trustworthy enough to base our future knowledge on and could transform humanity as we know it, in order for us to get there, we needed to start over. We needed to establish first principles, things that are absolutely true, so true they are self-evident and then through reason arrive at further conclusions. The way he did this is through a rigorous method of doubt, one comparable to Pyhrro in ancient Greece.\n\n\u201cI must once, for all, seriously undertake to rid myself of all the opinions which I had previously accepted and commence to build anew from the foundation, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences.\u201d\n\nRemember, one group of people he was fighting against was the radical skeptics, people that thought there was no way to EVER know anything for certain. And to be fair, nobody knew if there was. In many ways, people still don\u2019t know if there is. Descartes decided that in order to refute these radical skeptics he had to prove to them that some things CAN be known for certain and that THOSE things should be known as first principles that we can then use to reason and find further knowledge. But he had to be certain. He couldn\u2019t just sit down and come up with a couple dozen things he knows for certain and then expect the skeptics to take his word for it. They would ruthlessly tear anything he said apart. If there was ANY room for doubt, he would fail.\n\n\u201c[Since] reason already persuades me that I ought no less carefully withhold my assent from matters which are not entirely certain and indubitable than from those which appear to me manifestly to be false, if I am able to find in each one some reason to doubt, this will suffice to justify my rejecting the whole. \u201d\n\nThe only way he could be certain that his knowledge would hold up to the radical skeptic scrutiny is if Descartes himself made sure to argue against his own thoughts just as well as the greatest skeptics certainly would. This method of doubting absolutely everything in order to eventually arrive at first principles to base future philosophy on is really what he is best known for. Let me explain how Descartes did it and then we can see how it applies to our loud, naive friend at the party that we\u2019ve been talking about.\n\nDescartes starts by asking the easy questions. We\u2019d probably ask questions like: Is this Job REALLY the best job for me? Is this spouse of mine REALLY the love of my life? But then he goes deeper into doubt. He starts asking, what is it exactly that I am? And then deeper into doubt. He goes so deep that he questions whether the world around us is actually real. I mean, couldn\u2019t it be true? He says haven\u2019t our senses fooled all of us at some point in time? A mirage in the desert? You look at an optical illusion, your eyes play tricks on you? Descartes says that when he is dreaming, at least when he is inside of the dream, he thinks he is awake. He doesn\u2019t know until after he wakes up with the sheets sticking to his body that he was actually dreaming. How can we know for certain that we aren\u2019t dreaming right here, right now?\n\nThis is kind of embarrassing that I am using this example because it is so widely used, but there is so much ninja philosophy sprinkled around in the Matrix trilogy that it becomes a very useful tool when trying to explain these things. Morpheus asks Neo at a certain point in the first movie, how would you be able to tell the difference between the dream world and the real world? Descartes asks, centuries before the Wachowski brothers did LSD for the first time, how can we be CERTAIN this world that we perceive is real?\n\n\u201cI see so manifestly that there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep.\u201d\n\nBut wait! Descartes says that sure, our senses may always be at least potentially deceiving us, but certain things must be true even if we can\u2019t use our senses to accurately measure them. The things that make up the framework of the universe, things that are ALWAYS true, things like 2+2=4 and the parallel postulate. We may not be able to use our senses to arrive at truth, but we can use reason to arrive at these constants of the universe. But wait, there\u2019s more! Descartes goes even further! He says that even these things that are seemingly constant might not be true because there could be an entity whose whole existence is dedicated to deceiving us. How do we know that isn\u2019t the case?\n\n\u201cI shall then suppose . . . some evil genius not less powerful than deceitful, has employed his whole energies in deceiving me; I shall consider that . . . all . . . external things are but illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself to lay traps for my credulity.\u201d\n\nDescartes asks, how can I be certain that there isn\u2019t some evil demon assigned to me and my life that spends every second of every day trying to deceive me into believing the world exists. Kind of like in Monsters Inc. when there is a monster assigned to every child in the world\u2026how do we know that we don\u2019t have Sully assigned to our senses and he spends all day every day trying to convince us that cars exist, that food exists, that other people exist. How can we be CERTAIN that is not the case? Descartes says, we can\u2019t. But we can be certain about one thing. That we are thinking. Because even if the demon feeds us a thought that is intended to be deceptive, we are still thinking. A deceptive thought is still a thought, so therefore we must be thinking things. Descartes then reasons that simply by arriving at the self-evident point that we are thinking, we thereby exist. To him, we have to be in order to be thinking. I think, therefore I am.\n\nDescartes talks a lot about this method of rigorous doubt. He himself says that each individual person shouldn\u2019t apply this method to everything in their life as he did. That would be pointless. What possible benefit could we really get from doubting whether a hairdryer really exists. But what he does mention briefly is that this method of doubt is one that we must apply to our own critical beliefs. We should hold them up to the most intense skeptical scrutiny because like us pretending to know that that hair dryer exists, we can be conditioned to believe other things are the case. Things that can cause us harm. Things that prevent us from living life fully.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t apply this method to ALL of our beliefs. There are definitely beliefs that we all hold that are useful, but should we vilify entire groups of people or put needless obstacles in front of us in our personal lives simply because we want the world to be more simple than it actually is? Let\u2019s go back to our racist friend at the party. He\u2019s got this whole elaborate system of oversimplified beliefs that he\u2019s been spoon fed and conditioned to believe by his parents and now he lives his life as though they are the gospel truth. Think of how much more centered and based in reality his thoughts would be if he applied the method of doubt that Descartes outlines. What would happen if he put his racist views under the microscope?\n\nWhat if this guy was forced to ask himself, \u201cIs it possible that this single race of people, this group of people whose ancestors hailed from this small proximity with more or less sunlight, is it possible that they are not the downfall of the human species?\u201d Is it possible that the true cause is really much more complex based on historical events, trends and forces, government inefficiency, whatever it is. Descartes would say that if there is even a shadow of a doubt that you should throw that belief out and start over again.\n\nHow would a philosopher think about this? Just think of how much of a positive change abolishing that one oversimplification could make in this guys life. Now that he isn\u2019t denouncing an entire race of people, he frees up a lot of things that used to be impossible. Now that he isn\u2019t denouncing this race of people he has a lot more people he could potentially be friends with. This one change yields more meaningful relationships in his life.\n\nNow he doesn\u2019t have to walk around in a public place scowling at certain people based on their ethnicity, he doesn\u2019t have to have all the negative thoughts racing through his head when he sees them. \u201cThere they go, walking through the Farmers Market, RUINING THE WORLD AS USUAL.\u201d Think of how much that benefits him.\n\nOne byproduct of this change in his thoughts might be that he has more influence in the world than he initially thought! I mean, if this guy thinks the world is being brought down by a single race of people, he must also feel a certain amount of helplessness. How can he nurture the positive growth of the world when the simple PRESENCE of these people brings it down in his head? By thinking that the problems in the world are caused by societal forces, maybe he would feel a sense of empowerment, like he could actually make a change if he dedicated his time wisely! And think of what every Greek Philosopher would say about the satisfaction he stands to gain simply from the intellectual pursuit. Learning about all of the different opinions from anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and maybe one day arriving at the greatest gift to a mind imaginable: the understanding of truth.\n\nWhat criterion of truth is ample enough as a basis to marginalize entire groups of people?\n\nDescartes talks a lot about these conditioned biased thoughts. He actually gives a really great metaphor about apples. When you have a barrel of apples and you know that somewhere in that barrel are some bad apples that might spoil the whole bunch, what do you do? You can\u2019t go sifting through trying to delicately pick out the bad ones, what if you miss one? That one bad apple could ruin all of the rest of the good ones! Instead, you should dump all of the apples out and start over that way you are certain that you got all of them.\n\nOne biased thought arrived at based on conditioning is enough to spoil the whole barrel so to speak. Now next time on the show we\u2019re going to go further into Descartes life, the relationships that shaped his thought and more about how his Metaphysics shaped the famous divide between the continental rationalists and the British empiricists.\n\nWhenever you were forced to graph something on a Cartesian plane in mathematics, you can thank Descartes for making it possible. Before Descartes came along math was clearly separated into two parts: Geometry and Algebra. They were seen as two completely different areas of study. There weren\u2019t any algebraic equations to explain aspects of geometrical shapes and the people of the time period saw no reason to draw visual aids when practicing algebra.\n\nDescartes changed all of this. Although he never drew a second axis, he used the same tactics. He developed a way to show points in a uniform, evenly segmented plane around two perpendicular lines. By doing this, he not only connected the two practices but revolutionized mathematics by creating the foundations for analytic geometry.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n2 Comments"}, "episode_24": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 29 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #029 on Descartes pt. 2. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nHave you ever met one of those annoying people that always holds the opposite opinion of whatever the popular consensus is? No matter what it is, your life is a Shakespearean play and this guy is the contrarion to everything that everybody says. You could say I love the movie UP! by Pixar, what an incredible job they did at merging the elements of a film that both kids and adults like. This guy would go: yeah, no, I just couldn\u2019t get into it because\u2026Balloons on a house? I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s very realistic.\nYou could say: You know what I love? Fresh tuna. Directly from the ocean Fisherman catches it, takes it to the dock, somebody buys it and cooks it within hours. Doesn\u2019t get much better than that does it contrarian friend? Yeah, no My thing is I really like it from the can. Yeah, I really like it when it gets to sit at room temperature for 6-8 months and THEN I get to eat it. That\u2019s my thing.\nThere are a million examples of how this conversation may go and with some of them you just want to say, \u201cNo.\u201d You\u2019re dead wrong. There\u2019s nothing you can ever say that would make you right. Some things are just inherently BETTER. There is NO POSSIBLE WAY canned tuna is better than one freshly caught out of the ocean!\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the beginning of this famous divide in philosophy between the continental rationalists and the British empiricists and this argument is not that far from what these philosophers were feeling. The reason this contrarian friend of yours is so annoying is because you can\u2019t prove that you are right. It seems so obvious. What sane person chooses canned tuna over fresh tuna? But every single preference we have, from the taste of this hamburger vs that hamburger or the color of these curtains over those curtains, all of these preferences are based on our own individually flawed sense organs and their map of the world.\n\nSee, if you talked to this annoying friend of yours and told them that you think 2+2=4, they couldn\u2019t argue with you. Nobody is saying, maybe 2+2=4 to YOU, but to ME it equals 17 and you need to be respectful of that. No, these are mathematical certainties; there is no room for interpretation. Now if you were living during a time when the collective goal of Europe and the task that you\u2019ve dedicated your life to was trying to find a foundation on which truth can be arrived at, what gauge do you use to decide what \u201cfacts\u201d are up to the standards? Are you content with basing all future knowledge on Disney/Pixar\u2019s UP! is a very good movie? Or would you feel more comfortable basing it on 2+2=4.\nThis is how Descartes viewed the world. The collective goal was to find what Descartes labeled and envisioned as a Mathesis Universialis. Or a sort of universal language that relies heavily on mathematics to try to arrive at scientific truths and hopefully combine all these different areas of study into one comprehensive one. See, there was thinking at the time that all of these different areas that we\u2019re dedicating our thought to, all of these different natural sciences physics, chemistry, biology and then other things like algebra, geometry, there was a thinking that all of these things were needlessly fragmented. Maybe ALL of these different areas had a cohesiveness that has eluded us until now. Maybe there was a logic that applied to all of them. Maybe there was a single method we could apply to all of these seemingly different areas of study that could lead to progress in all of them. You know, by the time of Descartes, we had been working on geometry for quite some time, but compared to geometry we were neanderthals when it came to algebra. Descartes and others thought that maybe the universe was so well ordered that the connections that we\u2019ve made in a field like geometry, the relationships between different advancements, maybe that would be compatible to other fields as well. Maybe we could find an overall outline and then put some tissue paper over it and trace it out for other fields as well.\n\nYeah, sounds pretty straight forward doesn\u2019t it? Well, Descartes thought he could do it. If someone told you they were going to try to undergo a task like that in today\u2019s world, you would probably look at them like they were straining, red-faced trying to push their car down the road with the E-brake on. Times have changed! To even understand ONE of these fields you\u2019d have to go to school for a decade of your life, probably more! How are you going to A) learn enough about all of these fields to be able to be considered an expert and B) actually find the similarities? Well, back in the time of Descartes and this famous divide, we didn\u2019t know as much in all of these fields. It was a perfectly reasonable ambition to think that a single man with no life and an inferiority complex could find a universal approach to these things.\n\nThis is fascinating to me and if you love a good mystery, you have to be interested in this time period. Nobody knew whether science was possible, how to get there or even what sort of benefits it would bring to human life if we ever found it. But just the possibility that it was out there sparked all of these different people we\u2019ve been talking about to search for it. It was like the Apollo Program for the advent of science. It was like JFK stood up there and said I believe we can have a scientific method by the end of the decade, and these were the people that blindly dedicated their life to a task that may have been impossible. What sort of person does that take? What sort of person does it take to be a visionary challenger of the status quo? To take an idea that may not even be possible from their imagination and to not only execute it, but to change the course of human history with it? I\u2019ve been watching a lot of these Game changers things on Netflix about people like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and it\u2019s really interesting to see the common personality traits that these people have with Rene Descartes.\n\nSo let\u2019s make today\u2019s episode a little like one of those episodes on Netflix. The way it typically works is you learn about the life and story of one of these Game changers and then you learn how they actually changed the game, you learn a little about how they think and you typically come away with a few nuggets of wisdom. So lets learn about Descartes\u2019 life and then we can talk about how if he lived today his personality would make him a good candidate to be one of these people like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nDescartes had one of the most meandering, oddly-employed lives I have ever read about. If you were the hiring manager for a modern day company and looked at Descartes resume and gave him an interview, by the end of the interview you might think he was the WORST employee that has ever existed. If you asked him if he could wake up at 6am and work the day shift, he would say no: he slept in until noon almost everyday of his life without exception. If you asked him what his five year plan was and if he had the ability to settle down, take one vacation a year and be a loyal servant of corporatism, he would say no: he traveled almost constantly throughout his life and wouldn\u2019t think of sitting still. But despite these personality traits that make him a horrible employee for any modern company, if you were bad enough at hiring people to give him a shot he would be the most brilliant thinker you have ever encountered.\n\nHe was born on March 31, 1596 in France. He had three older siblings and his mother died very shortly after he was born while trying to give birth to what would have been his younger brother. With his mother gone, his father needed to step up and spend double time with all of his kids to try to make up for it, but he had a job as a judge which required him to be absent for many months at a time. Because of this, Descartes spent most of his childhood completely alone. But that wasn\u2019t all! He also was notoriously sick as a youth. He talks frequently about the predispositions he had to different ailments, and being left alone to wallow in his thoughts about all of the constant health problems ended up turning him into a severe hypochondriac throughout adulthood. After getting his education from the Jesuit College Royale, the only thing he really learned from it all was how inaccurate he thought it all was. He compared his education to the world of fiction, he talks about how as a rational person it is difficult for him to read fiction when he sees all of the apparent contradictions of the story and reality. But he saw the same contradictions when being taught all of these CERTAINTIES in school. This supposedly led him to ask the question, Can we know anything for certain? He didn\u2019t think he knew anything for certain, and all of these teachers yelling at people at the Jesuit College seemed to be just as confused as he was.\n\nHis dad wanted him to follow in his footsteps, you know get a real job in law, like him. After studying it for a few years he decided he didn\u2019t like it and ran off to Paris. He basically sat around all day, learned about stuff and wrote treatises on that stuff. This life seems like absolute paradise for a philosopher, but he didn\u2019t know that he was a philosopher yet, so he got tired of that too. Too many people polluting his thoughts, coming around doing terrible terrible things to him, like trying to talk and hang out with him. So he moved away and lived in solitude. But then he got tired of SOLITUDE, so he did the most logical next step imaginable, he signed up for the army as a volunteer officer. Now you\u2019d think, that when you\u2019re in the army that the last thing you are going to be allowed to do is wake up at noon and live like a transient, but apparently it wasn\u2019t a problem until one day when Descartes even got bored of the army! But then he finally found it. He finally found something that he could be passionate about and when he tells the story you can\u2019t help but think of that famous scene from the movie Good Will Hunting when the professor posts the unsolvable math equation on the wall and then Matt Damon solves it when he\u2019s taking a break from scrubbing the toilets of the university. One day Descartes was wandering down the road and came across a posting on the wall that showed a very difficult to solve math problem and challenged anyone and everyone to try to solve it. But there was one problem. Descartes was in Holland at the time and he didn\u2019t speak any Dutch, so he didn\u2019t know exactly what the instructions were for solving the problem. So he turns to his right and asks the guy next to him to translate it for him, the guy says \u201cI\u2019m only going to translate it for you if you try to solve it.\u201d, and then the next day Descartes shows up at the guy\u2019s house with the problem perfectly solved. This is the first time Descartes spoke to Isaac Beeckman. Beeckman was the friend and mentor that got Descartes focused. He was so turned off from mathematical pursuits from his time in school that he forgot how good he was at it. He forgot how much he loved it. Beeckman helped him rekindle this love.\n\nThe next big event in Descartes life may have been facilitated by the weather. There was a historically cold winter one year where he was living. So cold, that he claims he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and decided to live in a stove. Some people think he was joking when he said \u201cstove\u201d, some people think he was speaking figuratively and just meant a really warm, heated room; but even if he spent his days curled up inside of a stove nothing could be more bizarre than what happened to him during this cold, desolate winter.\n\nDescartes says that one of these days as he was sitting inside of his stove thinking about stuff, he had a vision. There are a lot of different interpretations of exactly what he saw or what happened, but what seems to be clear is that he saw something that made him certain that the universe was ordered in such a way that some undiscovered mathematical system could be used to fully understand it. Then, that very same night as he drifted off into his 12 hours of sleep, he had a series of vivid dreams that underscored everything that he had a vision of while sitting in the stove. In the first dream he was walking down the street trying to get to his church, but there was a MONSTROUS wind pushing him back. He was fighting against it as hard as he could, he looked like a small market weatherman trying to make a name for himself, going out standing in the middle of a hurricane being hurled around by the wind. Then somebody randomly says to him that somebody wants to give him a melon. In the second dream he is sitting in a room that is pitch black and a terrified and then a giant crashing sound happens and sparks start flying all around the room. The last dream is up for debate. Some people don\u2019t even think he had a third dream, but the important part is after this series of visions that he had, his view of the universe and his place within it was changed forever. This is the moment when he leveled up from transient genius to effective visionary genius.\n\nThis is what fascinates me the most about Descartes and people like Descartes. I am absolutely convinced that Descartes is the Steve Jobs of his generation. If nothing else, he definitely represents this extraordinary type of person that is needed to progress the human species. Descartes was a sickly child and a hypochondriac as an adult. He could\u2019ve accepted that he was a sick person and just spent his life trying to be as healthy as possible. Descartes didn\u2019t need to do any of what he did, so why did he? There are two very distinct approaches to adversity in life that probably are opposite ends of a giant spectrum and how many of each of these types of people exist really depends on your individual world view. On one end of the spectrum you have a type of person, we\u2019ve all met somebody like this before, it is the type of person who approaches life as a tourist. Life is about enjoying yourself as much as possible. When this guy\u2019s walking down the path of his life and there is a fork in the road and a boulder drops in front of him and is blocking the path he wants to go down, well it\u2019s not immediately enjoyable to exert yourself to climb over the boulder. It\u2019s not fun to try to find a solution to the problem, so this guy meets adversity with resistance. In the metaphor he kind of shrugs his shoulders and walks down the other path saying to everyone, \u201cWell, this obstacle was in my way, so I had to go down this path.\u201d This guy is not a bad person, but he does live his life circumventing adversity and as a victim of circumstance. Things HAPPEN to this guy, he doesn\u2019t make things happen.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum there\u2019s this person like Descartes or Steve Jobs. It\u2019s this type of person that when that boulder drops down in front of them and is blocking their path, they don\u2019t see it as an annoying obstacle. They see it as an opportunity for growth. This is the type of person that embraces adversity. This is the type of person that can visualize a future where that boulder no longer exists, where future people walking down the path can just walk by where this giant boulder used to sit and these people find a way to make it happen. Keep in mind, Descartes didn\u2019t need to adopt this approach to adversity. Like we talked about last time, the main problem that he faced, the main problem that many thinkers faced during his time, was uncertainty. Was knowledge even possible? What is science? Let\u2019s say we can find a method to understand the natural world, what benefits are we really going to gain from all that? To us in modern times, it\u2019s very easy to look back and wonder how anyone could doubt the possibility of science and the ability of science to drastically improve the lives of human beings everywhere but it wasn\u2019t clear back then. Just how Steve Jobs visualized a world where a functional, practical, all-in-one device existed that most people could afford; Descartes visualized a world where a functional, practical, all-in-one mathematical system existed that could help up understand the world.\n\nLet\u2019s not just gloss over that word \u201csystem\u201d. This is a big part of who Descartes was. I think by talking about the systematic way Descartes approaches thought in general, we can learn something about ourselves. Systematic thinking is a hallmark of this type of effective person who embraces adversity and removes these obstacles from their path. You know, we talked in the episode covering Aristotelean Ethics about achieving a \u201cmastery\u201d of life. Whenever you master any sort of activity, really what you are doing is developing a substantive reason for WHY you are doing each and every individual thing you do. Even something as simple as cooking eggs I was doing horrendously bad. I used to just crack the eggs into a pan, keep the heat low, when it turns white you scramble it up, put a little seasoning on it and you\u2019re good to go. But after watching Gordon Ramsey cook eggs, after listening to a true master talk about all of the different considerations he makes and contingency plans I realized that I hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how to make eggs properly. I want everybody to think right now of the thing that you are the best at. If somebody compiled a world rankings for every activity in the world, which activity would you be ranked the highest in? Now think back to the first time you ever did it. You were probably doing it the same way I was cooking eggs. But through hundreds of hours of practice, conducting little personal experiments, creating decision trees in your mind, developing contingency plans, eventually by doing all of these things you developed a system for doing it.\n\nDescartes was essentially trying to create a system for the universe. The catalyst that he thought would make that possible was mathematics. This guy was not just wandering throughout life complaining about all of the bad things that happened to him. He grabbed the helm of the ship and navigated the waters. You can\u2019t help but notice when you read him talk about the way he used to go about his everyday life that he applied this systematic approach to almost every object of his thought. In fact, late in his life he worked on a philosophical treatise that he never actually finished that was titled Rules for the Direction of the Mind. He lays out 12 rules that we should use to ensure that we are thinking about things in an appropriate way for science or philosophy, and he does a fine job. But what he also does is give us a realistic and systematic way of approaching any adversity we face in our lives\u2026ANY BOULDER that is blocking our path. The hardest part of handling adversity in our personal lives is uncertainty. Very similar to the uncertainty Descartes dedicated his life to destroying. Descartes understood that committing to a solution and moving forward with it would be much easier if we could identify with certainty what the problem actually was. Once we knew what the problem was, if we used a systematic approach and understood how the problem related to everything else in our life, we would be in a much better place to solve it.\n\nHe talks about this level of efficiency throughout most of his works, and really it was what he was all about. Developing certainty.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cDivide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it.\u201d\n\nRule nine in his Rules for the Direction of the Mind says:\n\n\u201cWe ought to give the whole of our attention to the most insignificant and most easily mastered facts, and remain a long time in contemplation of them until we are accustomed to behold the truth clearly and distinctly.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is that when you have a problem, be it scientific, philosophical or in your everyday life, if you\u2019re having trouble trying to solve it, break it down into the smallest pieces you possibly can and then behold the truth. The thinking is, these smaller pieces are much less complex, much easier for our minds to manage, so with less moving parts involved there is less opportunity for error. Much more opportunity for us to see truth clearly and distinctly.\n\nRule number three of his Rules for the Direction of the Mind is:\n\n\u201cAs regards any subject we propose to investigate, we must inquire not what other people have thought, or what we ourselves conjecture, but what we can clearly and manifestly perceive by intuition or deduce with certainty. For there is no other way of acquiring knowledge.\u201d\n\nOn that same note he said:\n\n\u201cSo blind is the curiosity by which mortals are possessed, that they often conduct their minds along unexplored routes, having no reason to hope for success, but merely being willing to risk the experiment of finding whether the truth they seek lies there.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s warning against is the tendency for humans to have a preconceived idea in their head of what they want the truth to be and then allowing that preconceived notion to shade the way that they view reality or the way they interpret the results of experiments. This is something we see ALL THE TIME in modern \u201cscience\u201d. (and I put that in quotation marks because it is not science). You have people that conduct surveys or scientific experiments, and before they even take the first sample they already have in their minds what they want the outcome of the experiment to be. So either because of their own human biases or because they are paid to, they look for every possible thing to reinforce what they WANT the outcome to be. Just watch any presidential debate in the last few election cycles and you\u2019ll have both people citing studies and surveys that came to conclusions that were DIAMETRIC opposites of each other. So there is definitely a scientific application for this rule, but it also applies to us in our personal lives. For example, let\u2019s say that you have a strong suspicion that your wife is cheating on you. You watch her sneak out of bed late at night and have a \u201cmysterious\u201d phone call. You walk in the room she hangs up the phone quickly. You notice she gets needlessly dressed up one morning and then you call her work at lunch time and left work early so you race home to catch her in the act and you storm in through the front door and she\u2019s setting up a surprise party for you.\n\nLet\u2019s not conduct experiments or gather evidence with too much confidence about what the outcome is going to be. It\u2019s fine to have a hypothesis, but at a certain point you may be misreading what is actually happening. It\u2019s hard sometimes because we all think that the experiments that we\u2019ve conducted up until this point in our lives is the greatest collection of scientific research ever undertaken. We all think we are looking at the world through a more accurate lens than everyone else around us, even if we acknowledge that we make more mistakes that others.\n\nDescartes said:\n\n\u201cCommon sense is the most fairly distributed thing in the world, for each one thinks he is so well-endowed with it that even those who are hardest to satisfy in all other matters are not in the habit of desiring more of it than they already have.\u201d\n\nThis quote is hilarious to me, and absolutely true. People ask for a LOT of stuff. They tell other people about all kinds of stuff that they\u2019re lacking that they need, but one thing you never hear even the lowliest street beggar ask for is common sense. He thinks he\u2019s got it all figured out. There\u2019s a great quote by Abraham Lincoln: Common sense is the collection of prejudices we acquire from birth until the age of 18.\n\nAnyway, next episode we are going to be talking about Descartes\u2019 proof of God\u2019s existence. This is one of the most widely studied proofs and naturally one of the most commented on. Get ready for a spirited debate between Descartes and some of the greatest minds who ever lived. I\u2019ll talk to you guys next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_25": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 30 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #030 Descartes pt. 3 \u2013 God Exists. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo being me, Stephen West, distinguished host of the podcast philosophize this!, I receive a good deal of email. That\u2019s right, I said it. Mountains of email that is very difficult to get through and the reason why it matters right now is because there are certain emails that are reoccurring. One of the most frequently reoccurring emails that comes my way is people asking me to help them respond to people trying to convert them. There used to be door to door vacuum salesmen\u2026in today\u2019s world there are door to door spokespeople of God. It is their duty when living on this planet to spread the word. When they see someone that obviously hasn\u2019t heard about how easy it is to get into heaven\u2026all you have to do is BELIEVE!\u2026they want to tell them about it. These are not bad people. Most of them have great intentions and genuinely care about people. But I think the reason why so many people ask me for responses to their typical questions is because they put people in a really weird spot.\n\nWhen someone comes to your door and asks you about what you think happens when you die, the situation gets awkward really fast. But why? Why are things so awkward. I think situations are awkward when there is some level of dishonesty present. There is something that one person knows that the other person doesn\u2019t know and the feeling of awkwardness is one person trying to find a politically correct way to break the news to them or avoid having the conversation. For example, when some nerdy guy at work comes up to you and says some obnoxious catch phrase that he came up with that isn\u2019t even remotely clever, you feel awkward because you have to think of a way to tell him that you don\u2019t like his little catchphrase and that he ISN\u2019T funny without actually saying it in a brazen way.\n\nWell the same thing applies with the aggressive conversion experts. This person comes into your house, you pour them a little lemonade like they\u2019re on To Catch A Predator, and they say, so How do you think all of this got here? That\u2019s a little bit like walking into somebody\u2019s house and saying Why did you break up with that ex-girlfriend of 10 years? The answer is always \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d. Just like you have a decade of history in a long term relationship to try to sum up in a single sentence, you have decades of contemplation about the nature of existence and they\u2019re basically asking you to do the same thing. This is a very difficult task.\n\nNow I absolutely love being tested. I seek out these sorts of conversations with random people; I love it. My friends have told me that when they look through the peephole and see someone in a bicycle helmet wearing a suit and tie that they close all the blinds and crawl around pretending not to be home. I ALWAYS answer the door. One thing I\u2019ve learned about the way they ask questions over the years is that there are two main avenues this conversation can go down, and the onus is on them to breach one of them. They usually ask the question \u201cDo you believe in God\u201d outright, or they will ask how you think the universe was created in the first place. The point of this question is so that they know where their efforts need to be focused on. If you answer \u201cYes.\u201d that you believe in God, then their task becomes to try to move you from one book of behavioral restrictions to another. If you say something like, I was raised a Muslim then their task becomes to try to convince you into accepting their rule book as opposed to your old one. You say something like yeah, I was raised a catholic but I stopped going to church because I felt like it started to not be aligned with what I believe and I just haven\u2019t found a new church. When you say that you believe in God, these are the sorts of conversations they have with you. But what if you say no. What if you say that you aren\u2019t sure whether God exists? Well this is the other avenue these conversations typically go down. If I were one of these people, when I went door to door this would definitely be the conversation that I enjoyed the least. The reason why is something that we\u2019ve touched on in the past and it is something that is very relevant to understanding Descartes and his cosmological argument for the existence of God.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that Rene Descartes was one of these door to door salvation salesmen. Let\u2019s imagine what Rene Descartes would say to you if you told him that you aren\u2019t sure whether god existed. Make no mistake, Rene Descartes would be the most annoying Jehovah\u2019s Witness that ever knocked on your door. He would be brilliant. He would also be arguing for the existence of something just a little bit different than your typical Jehovah\u2019s Witness. As we\u2019ve talked about before, there is a HUGE logical leap from believing that God exists and believing that the Christian or Muslim God exists. There are dozens of different takes on it: God is simply a master craftsman, God is a collective mind stream, God is the universe itself. There is a big difference between believing that some thing, some being brought this universe into existence and believing that that thing also exalts humans as a species above all the other ones and cares about whether you get that job that you just applied for. There are 50 shades of God. To convince someone that God exists is not to convince them that Jesus died for their sins. When Descartes set out to prove the existence of God, his task was not to convert people into Christians, he was referencing some infinite first cause from which all things initially sprang. Descartes WAS a Christian, but proving the concept of God was to have a basis for his rationalist philosophical system, not to get more money thrown in the collection plate.\n\nYou know, there are several instances in his work where he echoes a sentiment that Montaigne talks about a lot. He says if you live in a society or a culture where something very important to the culture is WIDELY accepted as true, that even if you could destroy it with argument, maybe it is best to just go along with it if you want to be productive in other areas. I mean, if you walk around all day looking for things that you don\u2019t agree with, and whenever you see one of them you assign yourself the burden of CORRECTING that person or group, can you ever get anything substantive done aside from that life? I could spend every second of every day supposedly correcting people around me, and what has changed at the end of the day? There needs to be a line drawn somewhere\u2026Descartes isn\u2019t saying that you should just blindly trumpet the status-quo, but with Descartes living in a world where people are being prosecuted and brutally punished for going against the previous teachings of the church, we can be empathetic; we can understand why Descartes might adopt certain appearances in the interest of keeping the powers that be happy. And this is not conjecture\u2026we see it in his work. He wrote a treatise, he actually never finished it, but for years of his life he was researching and constructing a treatise arguing for the validity of Copernicus and several other scientific findings that directly challenged what the church had been teaching for so long and then right when he was wrapping things up, the whole Galileo thing happens and Descartes says \u201cAlright, well. Onward and upward. Those were some productive years I just spent.\u201d He never finished the work\u2026 and it really wasn\u2019t that crucial in the grand scheme of things anyway.\n\nSo when Descartes comes to your door and you tell him that you\u2019re not sure whether God exists or not, this is a big road block for him. This is an equally big road block for him back in his time. But why does Descartes need for a God to exist? Why does he need this infinite being that gave rise to the universe as we know it? Well to understand that, we need to reference what we talked about a couple episodes ago. Cogito Ergo Sum: I think, therefore I am. or I think therefore I exist. Remember Descartes started by subjecting everything in the world to the most rigorous doubt imaginable. He did this in order to find some irrefutable truth. Some mathematical axiom for the world, if you will. The reason I say mathematical axiom, is because he needed a foundation that he could use as a basis for making future claims. Now he talks about how he doesn\u2019t know whether ANYTHING around him truly exists because after all, an evil demon could be constantly deceiving him into believing these things exist. But there is one thing he can\u2019t deceive him about and that is that he is thinking. Because even if he is having a deceptive thought, he is still having a thought. So he can be sure that he is a thinking thing that exists.\n\nThe mathematical axiom\u2026the basis from which Descartes is trying to build a full philosophical system is that he exists. So from here he asks, okay, well if I know that I exist, then because something cannot come from nothing, something must have caused my existence. So what was it? Well it was my parents when they were 20 years old and had a little bit too much to drink. My parents caused my existence\u2026and this begs the question: What caused their existence? Well it was their parents. When you look at every single thing that exists, every rock, every tree, every planet, every moose frolicking around they all eventually come back to the same point. What caused that point? Descartes isn\u2019t even necessarily talking about the beginning of the universe\u2026if there is a creator of this universe, what caused that creator to come into existence? What caused the creator of THAT creator to come into existence? This infinite thing or being is was Descartes calls God. This is a mainstay of philosophy at the time of Descartes\u2026we\u2019ve talked about it before with Aquinas and a couple of the Persian and Islamic philosophers\u2026it is what is known as the Cosmological argument.\n\nDescartes needs this God as part of his picture for many reasons. One: Although we CAN never stop doubting what is around us and say that it is possible that an evil demon is constantly deceiving us, Descartes obviously doesn\u2019t want to stop the discussion there. We can be pretty sure all of this stuff exists, even if we can\u2019t prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, and by saying that this infinitely great God is responsible for our perceptions of the world, it takes out the possibility of the evil demon. He says that as an infinite, perfect being God would never deceive us, so therefore we can be certain that what we see about the world is the way that is actually is. Please reserve your objections to this for later on. The point of me saying this is to explain why God is so important in Descartes worldview.\n\nAnother big reason god is important is because Descartes is a rationalist and mathematician. He is setting out on a pretty daunting task: to prove that the universe and everything in it is connected to each other. Causal relationships, logical relationships\u2026there are lines connecting every thing and everyone. The problem with that is that if that is a possibility then there must be an endpoint. There has to be a bookend from which everything is derived from, or else these connections might all be invalid. These connections can\u2019t go on into infinity. This is a problem that not just Descartes will run into\u2026we will see it in the other continental rationalists Spinoza and Leibniz. The bookend that Descartes uses as a starting point is this infinite perfect being known as God.\n\nSo, famously Descartes uses two main arguments to prove the existence of God. One we\u2019ve already heard of before it is called the ontological argument. St. Anselm talked about this. If we define God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived, and we can conceive of and infinite perfect being, then because something existing in reality is at least marginally greater than something that exists only in thought, That infinite perfect being MUST exist in reality: Therefore God exists. We\u2019ve talked about that one, and it really isn\u2019t worth talking about how Descartes uses it because he uses it later on in his Meditations and it seems like more of a supplementary argument because his first argument gets a little sketchy. You know\u2026this is the: If you didn\u2019t buy my FIRST argument, here is one that seems to be rock solid.\n\nHis first argument is notoriously confusing. I think philosophy professors around the world are forced to teach this argument and all of them struggle to find a way to convey it in any sort of memorable way. It\u2019s also notoriously oversimplified. I took a philosophy 101 class where I needed to write a paper on this argument and in the book it explained it\u2026I thought that I understood it\u2026and then six months later I actually read Descartes meditations and went back to the book and realized that it was completely wrong. This was in a textbook, so you can imagine how many different interpretations of this argument there are and as a podcaster I will do my best to give you a well-rounded account.\n\nDescartes would be sitting in your house\u2026sipping your lemonade and he would begin his proof of God\u2019s existence by talking about an important distinction when it comes to existence. He would look around your house or your apartment and pick something out\u2026say a table for instance. That table has two forms of reality: formal reality and objective reality. And he even breaks it down more than this, but let\u2019s not go there. Each thing has a different level of formal reality\u2026if God existed he would have an infinite level of formal reality\u2026that table sitting there has a finite level of formal reality and a few other obscure things like qualities of things including ideas of things have what Descartes calls modal formal reality. Modal being an even lesser form of formal reality than finite.\n\nThe point of this is that everything has varying degrees of this thing called formal reality. But what about things that exist as thoughts? I mean, if I have an idea of something in my head\u2026does that idea exist? Well yeah it does. But the idea of a table in my head does not exist as much as that table actually existing in physical form. For example, I can imagine the idea of an absolutely perfect triangle, but that perfect triangle doesn\u2019t exist anywhere in the physical world\u2026why would it. That would be kind of random\u2026just a triangle floating around. Descartes talks about things that exist as ideas\u2026or objects of thought and he gives them something he calls objective reality. Now, just like everything that exists has varying levels of formal reality, all IDEAS have varying levels of objective reality, and what determines their LEVEL of objective reality is the thing that they are representing. If you have an idea of God, that idea has an infinite level of objective reality, if you have an idea of that table, it has a degree of finite objective reality and if you are thinking of qualities like blue-ness or sharpness, then they have a modal objective reality.\n\nNow Descartes says that ALL humans have an innate idea of this thing we call God as being infinite. I mean, to create everything in the universe this thing needed to be un-caused, so therefore necessarily existing always. Outside of the boundaries of time, so therefore eternal and timeless. To give rise to everything physical, it itself cannot be a physical being, so therefore it must be incorporeal or spiritual. So Descartes says we ALL have an innate understanding of this being as being infinite. And because of that, our idea of God has an INFINITE objective reality. He says that every idea that we have, everything with objective reality, was created by something with a higher level of formal reality. For example, we can have ideas of tables, rocks, chairs or mooses frolicking around because we have a higher level of formal reality than these things. Yes, we have a FINITE level of formal reality, but we have MORE formal reality than a rock, so therefore we can create ideas about that rock. If this logic seems confusing it is because he is deriving it from the laws of cause and effect that he studied endlessly in his life. There must be as much reality in the cause of something as in the effect it generates. So if we as flawed humans are not infinite beings\u2026where did we get this idea of an infinite being from? What caused that infinite idea to come into existence in the first place? Well, based on the laws of cause and effect it needed to be something infinite. A finite being cannot bring into existence an infinite idea. The infinite being that brought that idea into existence, is what we call God.\n\nAlright so at this point I would like to thank God that we are done explaining that. Imagine Descartes sitting on your couch and he just got done explaining that to you. I mean what do you even say? Do you just point to the door and say\u2026\u201dLeave this house.\u201d There was a video that went viral a couple months ago where this couple has this dancing Halloween toy that is malfunctioning and they are convinced it is possessed by a demon and they are going crazy saying: \u201cI REBUKE THEE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST! LEAVE THIS HOUSE!\u201d I was absolutely rolling on the floor laughing and that is how I would treat Descartes if he came into my house with his formal and objective reality. Let\u2019s talk about how you SHOULD respond to Descartes\u2026Let\u2019s talk about how people typically criticize the argument.\n\nBy far the most common rebuttal to Descartes system is what seems like a logical inconsistency that has become known as \u201cThe Cartesian Circle\u201d. What it points to is his circular reasoning when it comes to proving that a non-deceptive god exists. Remember, he uses God as the being that insures there is NOT an evil demon constantly deceiving him, but he relies on his thoughts being non-deceptive to arrive at the conclusion that that God exists.\n\nThis really isn\u2019t as much of a contradiction as it would initially seem. Descartes argues back that he doesn\u2019t rely on God to feed him non-deceptive thoughts ALL the time. While we are attending to what he calls a \u201cclear and distinct\u201d perception where it is so clear and distinct that we can\u2019t doubt the validity of it, we don\u2019t need God. The insurance that God provides is to prevent us from doubting things while we are not looking at them anymore. As a very crude example, lets say you\u2019re a UPS delivery guy and you deliver a box to the same front porch every day. At one point you determined that there are two stairs leading up to the front door, and then each day after that the box you are carrying obstructs your view of the stairs. You are no longer ATTENDING to the stairs. The insurance that God provides is that those stairs have not changed since the last time you did your analysis. Now imagine this example as it would apply to a series of logical connections throughout the universe.\n\nThere is a lot of argument against Descartes and his creation of this idea of objective vs formal reality. Many people wonder why there even needs to be a distinction and what basis he has for making this distinction. On one end he relegates the existence of ideas and makes them lesser than things that have finite formal reality, but on the other end he makes their existence greater than things with finite formal reality. Another common objection is that it is a huge logical leap to arbitrarily say that beings with finite formal reality cannot possibly conceive of something with infinite objective reality.\n\nBut the largest disagreement is probably when he says that we all have an innate idea of this being known as God as being infinite. Why is that necessarily the case? Many cultures throughout history have vehemently believed in a creator that in itself was not infinite. If this idea of an infinite entity is TRULY innate, which is what Descartes NEEDS to prove, why do these people not have it?\n\nThe common explanation is that they don\u2019t. The only people that do are people that were born into a society or culture that regularly plants the seeds in the heads of their young that an infinite creator exists. That constant reinforcement shades the direction of their thoughts, so although everyone around Descartes may have had this conception from a very young age, it might not be inherent. This may be the chickens coming home to roost. This may be a manifestation of what we talked about earlier where when the bulk of society believes something that we should pick our battles and sometimes just go along with it. Maybe Descartes should have fought that battle. One thing is for certain\u2026which as we continue our journey through philosophy we will realize\u2026is that if he had fought this battle, if he had questioned whether the idea of an infinite God TRULY was innate\u2026it would\u2019ve been a lonely, depressing road ahead.\n\nTalk to you guys next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_26": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 31 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #031 on Pascal\u2019s Wager. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo last week we visualized what it would be like if Rene Descartes came to your door, kind of like he was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and tried to talk you into believing the way he does when it comes to the nature of existence. We talked about how these conversations where these people come to your door and try to convert you typically go down two paths: to prove the legitimacy of their ethical doctrine or to make you believe in God. We visualized Descartes sitting on your couch, drinking your lemonade and trying to PROVE to you that God exists. Now if you thought this visual was ridiculous, that\u2019s because it was. I mean think about it, nobody comes into your house and when you say that you aren\u2019t sure whether you believe in God or not, nobody sits you down and starts trying to rationally PROVE the existence of God with charts and graphs. They just don\u2019t. And as people thrust out of our mothers into this modern world, we aren\u2019t very familiar with this way of thinking. I mean, have any of you tried to tell anyone about St. Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument? What is the typical reaction you get from them when they first hear it? Its probably the face of utter confusion. It\u2019s the exact same face they gave you when you told them you were quitting your job and trying out for America\u2019s Got Talent. This way of PROVING the existence of God just isn\u2019t used anymore at a door to door level; The guy we\u2019re going to talk about today took a slightly different approach, one that is going to be much less foreign to us as modern readers and one that we probably all can weigh in on at a certain level.\n\nHis name was Blaise Pascal. Contemporary of Rene Descartes. He was a French Polymath Genius, who would probably define himself as most notably two things: a mathematician and a Christian. We\u2019re going to be talking a bit about Pascal, but I want to start with what he is most commonly known for. It\u2019s called Pascal\u2019s Wager. Now it should be noted directly from the top that Descartes was setting out to prove the existence of merely an infinite, perfect being\u2026a sort of metaphysical bookend from which he could derive the rest of his rationalist philosophy. Pascal on the other hand, although his Wager could be applied to most faiths, at least of the modern monotheistic variety, Pascal was trying to show that to not believe in the Christian God was irrational.\n\nThis is a very important distinction: Instead of trying to PROVE to you that God exists beyond a shadow of a doubt\u2026Pascal recognized that we could never be 100% CERTAIN of whether God exists and his argument was centered around the idea that it didn\u2019t matter. The Christian God was the most likely one that exists to Pascal during his time and setting and he set out not to PROVE the existence of God, but to show that to NOT believe in God was just a dumb decision. To give us some perspective, and because this week it will be a lot more believable in your head, let\u2019s pretend that Blaise Pascal came to the door with Rene Descartes that day and after Descartes was done trying to PROVE to you that God existed and you weren\u2019t satisfied, let\u2019s hear was Blaise Pascal has to say about it. This really isn\u2019t that far from the truth because Pascal\u2019s Wager is one of the most common conversion tactics that these door to door salesmen use on people. But a lot has changed since the times of Blaise Pascal\u2026right? He would be knocking on the doors of people much different than people of his time.\n\nBecause of the centuries of advancements in science that people like Descartes and Pascal were facilitating during their time, most people that are agnostic in today\u2019s world think of truth and belief in terms of evidence. I mean, in today\u2019s world if some random guy comes out with some harebrained theory that, you know, Thales was right! The world really IS made of water! \u2026 Most people listening to this would be like\u2026OK buddy. Get out of here. World is made of water\u2026why don\u2019t you go and do some experiments and studies and come talk to me when this is something other than WILD speculation. Come talk to me when you have some evidence to back your claims.\n\nWell this way of thinking naturally starts to creep its way into thoughts about God, religion and the rest of it. Blaise Pascal would be talking to an agnostic person that believes something quite different than the people of his time. This type of person applies critical thinking 101\u2026they ask themselves: well, if THIS is true, what else MUST be true as a result of it. People like this would say to a devout Christian like Pascal whose God claims to offer PERSONAL salvation that if the Christian God existed, he must be very smart. All-knowing if you will. God must recognize that as someone born into modern times that there are dozens of choices to focus your spiritual efforts on, and none of them have any more credibility than the next. There is nothing objective about them. There is nothing undeniable separating Catholicism from Islam from Judaism from Mormonism, etc. ALL of the adherents to these various different religions are forced to have faith that theirs is the one that is actually real while the members of all the others are condemned to hell.\n\nNow the typical thing one of these modern agnostics will say is, why does it make sense that it would be this way? They would say if this earth that we are living on is truly just an ethical obstacle course where we are going to be met with temptations and struggles and relationships and based on how we act during this short 80 year period, that will determine whether where we go for eternity, if that is true: why does it all need to be shrouded in mystery? I mean, God is all-powerful. We don\u2019t NEED to be born with zero conception of what the earth is. For all intents and purposes we could begin life in spiritual form up in the clouds with God playing some sort of bizarre game show where he lays everything out for you. Some bizarre version of Wheel of Fortune where God is the host and he says to you, OK. I exist. Jesus was my son, he died for your sins you should appreciate that, but let\u2019s not talk about that now\u2026it\u2019s all laid out in the book\u2026you can read it once you get down there. But now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way let\u2019s spin this giant wheel and find out what body you\u2019re going to be programmed into: will it be inner city youth? Will it be stock broker? Ferris Wheel repair man? Let\u2019s see what you get!\n\nYou spin the wheel\u2026you get sucked down and get made into a fetus and you are born with knowledge of what this existence TRULY is. These modern people would say\u2026why can\u2019t THAT be the case? Well the fact of the matter is that it\u2019s not the case. So these people use critical thinking again and they would ask, well if God COULD choose to NOT make the most important thing EVER a mystery\u2026your eternal fate hangs in the balance and God CHOOSES to make it a guessing game. He doesn\u2019t NEED to do that by any means, so why does he?\n\nMore importantly they would ask: Why is someone BLINDLY conceding to a religion more valuable to God than someone who is presented by God with a decision and CHOOSES to abide by the moral code laid out in the Bible? These modern agnostics would ask: why does it mean more to God when someone is born into a home where their parents believe in what might be one of the dozens of religions that could send them to hell, given the fact that he could at any point remove all the mystery, why does blind acceptance to a religion mean more to him than reasoned acceptance? If Blaise Pascal came to the door of one of these modern agnostics this is the question he would be faced with. And generally speaking, this is where most of these people sit because they say\u2026well if Christianity is true, none of this stuff makes sense to me, but I\u2019ll tell you what does make sense to me: Humans doing dishonest stuff. Humans leveraging control over other people and marginalizing anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them so that they can maintain power. This is seen all throughout human history. I mean, it totally makes sense that someone that understood the benefits of living an ethical life that was just a little bit smarter than the people around him would write a book laying out, on one hand, a good way to act that benefits society and on the other hand a story about an infinitely powerful being that will punish you if you don\u2019t. This is a very plausible scenario even to Blaise Pascal because in his view, that\u2019s what all of the other religions are: false prophets that lied to harness control over people.\n\nSo Blaise Pascal is presented with a problem with this line of argument. He can\u2019t prove the existence of God with any certainty and there does seem to be a bunch of needless mystery on one end and a rational explanation on the other. But this is how brilliant Pascal was. He manages to find an argument that does an effective job of showing that even if there is mystery, the best choice for the layperson might be to just believe. Blaise Pascal was a mathematician. He often times thinks about life and existence in mathematical terms. He talks about how humans are not God. We, as humans, walking around going about our daily lives, we don\u2019t have complete control over what happens to us. In fact, Pascal says, at best we make calculated risks where the calculations are based on all of our prior experience in that given field. For example, let\u2019s say you want to start a small business as your family\u2019s means of income. There is a very REAL uncertainty as to whether enough money is going to be coming in for you to pay your bills. So in the interest of security, you choose not to start your business and instead you get a job at a big company in the city. Now that is security you can count on. Now, at least you KNOW the paycheck is going to be coming in, right? Well, no that\u2019s not true. At any point that company could downsize or the economy could tank and they would drop you in an instant, but it certainly DOES assume LESS risk than starting your own business. In this way you are hedging your bets. Neither of the two options are absolutely certain, but the outcome of one decision puts you in a favorable position more times out of 100 than the other one, so you choose it.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about another example of this: you want to go on vacation to Hawaii. The only way you\u2019re going to get to Hawaii is on a plane. The odds of you getting to Hawaii in one piece are ENORMOUSLY favorable for you. It is something like a 1 in 10 million chance for you to die in a plane crash and I\u2019m pretty sure that is a worldwide statistic so if it was limited to just the United States and Canada it might be even better. But do you have absolute certainty that you will make it there? No. You are hedging your bets. This decision is ALSO a calculated risk. You are assuming the one in 10 million risk in order to be the type of person that goes on vacation to Hawaii as opposed to the type of person that sits around and types Maui into Google images on a bi-weekly basis like yours truly. Except, for me it is not because I\u2019m scared of flying it\u2019s because it costs thousands of dollars to go.\n\nWe will go into this more on another day, but Pascal talks about how these calculated risks encompass virtually every decision that we make on this planet. Every decision that you make and every belief that you hold is a calculated risk. Your thoughts about God, your eternal fate and the nature of existence should be no different. Keep in mind that when Pascal talks about this he is appealing to an agnostic. There were a lot of these people in France during his lifetime in light of all the scientific progress that was being made. If on one end you had Christians and on the other hand you had Atheists, there were several pockets in the middle of that spectrum and one incredibly large pocket during the time of Pascal was someone who wasn\u2019t completely satisfied by either explanation. So instead of trying to PROVE the existence of God, Blaise Pascal asks these people to hedge their bets like they do with every other belief that they hold. He presents them with what is known as Pascal\u2019s Wager.\n\nHe says that if you don\u2019t believe and God and he doesn\u2019t exist\u2026then you die and nothing happens. You rot in a pine box until the sun explodes in a couple billion years. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t believe in God and he DOES exist, then you made a huge mistake. A mistake that is going to cost you infinitely. You are now banished to a lake of fire, pushing boulders up a hill for all eternity. Things are not too good for you either way.\n\nThe other option is to believe in God. Pascal says if you believe in God and he doesn\u2019t exist\u2026then it\u2019s the same as the first one. You die and nothing happens. But if you believe in God and he DOES exist, then you have an infinite amount to gain. You never have to die! You get to spend eternity talking to people in heaven about how right you were!\n\nThe most common way it is summarized is if you believe in God and he doesn\u2019t exist then you have lost nothing. But if you believe in God and he exists, you have gained everything. Therefore, it is downright irrational to NOT believe in God. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose.\n\nNow, just for the record Pascal would never say that you have NOTHING to lose. How bout every Sunday morning for the rest of your life? How about 10% of your income? How about being an autonomous adult with the ability to choose an ethical system that yields the life you want for yourself and your family? The list goes on.\n\nPascal would\u2019ve never said that you have NOTHING to lose, he would say that what you have to lose is finite. It is all those things I just said and more, but when it comes down to it you are losing something finite and standing to gain something infinite. We can see his logic here and with a slight changing of the wording it becomes a very compelling argument. We\u2019ve probably all heard this argument in some form or another. In my experience the most common variant of it in today\u2019s world is someone asking you, What if you\u2019re wrong about what you believe? Then what? Let\u2019s talk about some of the famous rebuttals to Pascal\u2019s Wager\u2026I asked on Twitter this week for people to send me their favorite ones.\n\nChris Bush (@cbush) on Twitter said that \u201cEither I believe or I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not a matter of choice. Belief has a certain irresistablity about it.\u201d This has to be one of the most common ones and it is very true. Let\u2019s say that everything Pascal said is true and I am an agnostic, even if he shows me how impractical it is to NOT believe in God, can you really make a conscious choice to BELIEVE in something?\n\nWhat if Pascal said you should believe in Santa Claus because you have a stocking full of presents to gain and nothing to lose. Could you just decide to believe in Santa? You can pretend to believe in something. You can tell yourself something over and over again trying to brainwash yourself into believing something. But when you believe something it is beyond choice. You just believe it. Pascal\u2019s Wager doesn\u2019t address any of the things that caused doubt in the agnostics mind in the first place.\n\nJonathan D\u2019Angelo (@future_jonathan) on Twitter said that \u201cHow about the biggest flaw: that it presupposes the selection of the correct god.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this is shining light on a flaw in the argument itself, but it does underscore the fact that Pascal\u2019s Wager could just as easily be used to justify belief in the existence of some other God: Allah, or Zeus or Tom Cruise. The significance of this is that many of these religions are incompatible at the most fundamental level. If you believe in one and another one of them end up being correct, you burn in hell. So the thinking is, Pascal paints this picture as though a belief based on this criteria only might yield infinite gain, when it might also yield infinite loss. This doesn\u2019t destroy Pascal\u2019s Wager, but it is something interesting to think about.\n\nBut let\u2019s talk about the other side and what advocates of Pascal\u2019s Wager would say. The typical place this conversation goes is that they start talking about exactly what is it that you stand to lose by not believing in God and living your life as a non-believer. They\u2019re talking about that one part of Pascal\u2019s Wager that presents a downside to believing in God. He says that if you believe in God and he doesn\u2019t exist, then you\u2019ve lost nothing, or you\u2019ve lost a finite amount. Well, there are a lot of people who say that losing that finite amount is actually losing A LOT! The other side says, \u201cReally? Are you really losing a lot?\u201d They say, what\u2019s the alternative to living a Christian life? You live a hedonistic life where pleasure is the highest good! Being a Christian requires sacrifice, no doubt about that. But by not sacrificing\u2026by eating whatever you want and having sex with whoever you want and living a godless life hellbent on attaining pleasure, is that lifestyle really better? Usually these people end up with terrible relationships and health problems and a lack of priorities. They don\u2019t have a sense of purpose and they\u2019re scared all the time. If that is the FINITE thing that you stand to lose, is it really worth clinging on to?\n\nI have heard this argument probably from 50 different people in my lifetime. It is absolutely fascinating that so many people parrot this line of thinking. They must have success with it or they wouldn\u2019t have said it to me, but I wonder what type of person doesn\u2019t see the obvious fallacy in it. What\u2019s the alternative to living a Christian life? Leading a hedonistic life!\n\nWhy is that necessarily the case? They created a false dichotomy. Why is the ONLY alternative to a belief in the Christian God a life of hedonism where pleasure is the highest good? Hedonism is an ethical doctrine, just like the one laid out in the Bible. Do these people really think that there are two ethical doctrines that exist in the history of man? Hedonism and Christian ethics? No, there are hundreds. And let\u2019s talk for a second about what one of these modern agnostics would say about ethics. Nothing is intrinsically good or bad. A system of what is right and wrong, or good and bad, what we call a system of ethics is only possible if there is an end goal attached to it. There is an ideal life that we want for ourselves and then a system of behaviors to follow that will yield that outcome. Let\u2019s say the ultimate goal of your life was to have the most meaningful, deep, trusting relationships possible. What sort of behaviors yield that outcome? You certainly need to be honest. You certainly need to be temperant. You certainly need to exercise self-control.\n\nWhat one of these modern agnostics would say is that the bible is two things. On one hand a beautiful ethical doctrine that helped usher in an age of egalitarianism in the world\u2026an ethical doctrine that they largely follow whether willingly or not because it yields a life desired by many. On the other hand it is a story that is used to get people to follow that ethical doctrine. The positive benefits afforded by Christians that someone making this argument would contrast with a life of hedonism are a byproduct of following a solid system of behaviors, not a belief in God. They would argue that anyone could follow the system of behaviors laid out in the bible and see extremely positive effects in their life, the difference would be that a believer would see them as a supernatural God reaching his hand down and getting them that job they just applied for, and the other person would see it as the natural byproduct of being a virtuous person. People want to give honest, patient, temperant, courageous people jobs. The only alternative to Christianity is Hedonism? A way of thinking that is WIDELY denounced by almost every philosopher that ever created a system of ethics? Hedonism is a straw man. It\u2019s an easy target when in reality there are hundreds of systems to choose from. So what is at stake for someone arguing the other side? Autonomy. The ability to choose the end goal of their life. And while, inevitably, much of their personal ethical doctrine may overlap with the one laid out in Christianity, the belief in God, to these people really has nothing to do with it.\n\nReal quick some other common arguments against Pascal\u2019s Wager are that he pigeonholes the possibilities that can come after death. For example, couldn\u2019t you be an atheist and still have an afterlife in some spiritual form? There are other possibilities that he leaves out. Uh, another is that the BASIS for the argument is that you are taking the best calculated risk, but because of the thousands of Gods already proposed by man in various civilizations throughout history it actually makes the chances of this single, Christian God minuscule. But it should be said that probability is EQUALLY as minuscule as all the other ones, it\u2019s not like any other religion has it more correct by any means. One other common criticism is that if God is an infinitely perfect and therefore infinitely just being, why would he condemn a person to hell if they follow his system of ethics but cannot bring themselves to believe in him. Why is BELIEVING so important to God? Doesn\u2019t that make him an unjust God? This is a good question in itself, but it doesn\u2019t do anything to Pascal\u2019s argument and is easily explained by most Holy Books.\n\nLook, when it comes down to it, Pascal\u2019s Wager has been heavily commented on over the centuries by great thinkers. There is a lot of firepower up against it at this point. But make no mistake, Blaise Pascal is one of the most astoundingly brilliant figures in the history of philosophy and next week we are going to talk about a famous paradox that I guarantee everybody listening will relate to immensely. Thanks for listening, I will talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_27": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 32 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #032 on Pascal pt. 2 \u2013 +EV your way to success! Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nBlaise Pascal famously said that all of us living\u2026and the condition that we find ourselves living through, this crazy roller coaster that we\u2019re on, he refers to it as the \u201csupreme paradox of creation\u201d. Man is the great paradox of creation. He said that as humans, we constantly live in a state of the highest grandeur and the deepest misery. Simultaneously. But why? What is it about man that could possibly account for that sort of variance? I mean, he is obviously calling us out as a species. He didn\u2019t say living creatures on planet earth are this way\u2026he said Man is the great paradox of creation. Why did he say that? Well to fully understand where he is coming from, we need to set the stage and get a little perspective on what sort of world Pascal was living in and what sort of person Pascal was. We\u2019ll gain that perspective through the show today and near the end of the show, we\u2019ll come back to that famous quote and it will make a lot more sense to us.\n\nSo. Blaise Pascal. He invented the calculator. Not kidding. All the way back in 1642 at the age of only 18 years old his dad was an accountant and for anybody that has done any sort of personal accounting in today\u2019s world or taken a class on this you can relate to it, but there was a TON of monotonous, menial calculations of arithmetic that were incredibly time consuming and Pascal, filled with ingenuity and the mind of a polymath genius created a device in 1642 that could add, subtract, multiply and divide and became not only an object of admiration from the people immediately around him for actually inventing the thing, but he became his father\u2019s favorite son. I mean come on, at that point what does he say to his other kids. I love you guys just as much\u2026just differently. Nope\u2026nobody was buying that garbage anymore, Pascal was the man. But it\u2019s not like his father didn\u2019t see this early representation of his genius coming, he had been facilitating it and trying to nurture it for years. Blaise Pascal lived in a pretty amazing time, obviously, because the show is chronological, it wasn\u2019t that far removed from the time we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now, the scientific revolution. Well, the exact decade that Pascal was born was a time of UNPRECEDENTED change. Change on a scale that no one EVER could have foreseen. If you were someone who wanted to create something or think of some idea that spreads like intellectual contagion and changes the way that people around you view the world, Pascal\u2019s lifetime was the perfect time to be born. Whenever there are HUGE breakthroughs throughout human history, it is always very shortly after those breakthroughs come to pass that some person is born that is seen in retrospect as incredible. This period of time after this huge paradigm shift is a time of HUGE opportunity if you were trying to change the world.\n\nPascal was part of a new age of thinkers. He was 14 years old when Descartes released his Discourse on Method. This text as we talked about before sparked a huge debate and in that sense it was revolutionary. Pascal, was the first generation to benefit from those insights. Kind of makes you wonder about what is possible and what sorts of people are emerging as the first generation able to benefit from something as revolutionary as the internet in today\u2019s world. I mean, imagine if someone as brilliant as Blaise Pascal had access to the internet. What could a polymath genius accomplish if he had the collective knowledge of the history of man available at his fingertips instantly? Probably wouldn\u2019t be Nyann Cat that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Anyway, Pascal\u2019s father was a very intelligent man and he understood the inherent biases in the way that people were being educated back in the 1600\u2019s. During the time of the upbringing of Pascal, the average school of the time was riding the tail end of this wave of Scholasticism, and they were riding it directly into the ground. See, for a long long time if you were learning about something like, the natural sciences in school, you just read Aristotle.\n\nYou studied him. You memorized him. He was the unchallenged authority on that sort of stuff. But now that we\u2019re trying to navigate the dark waters of the post scientific revolution\u2026now that we\u2019re searching for certainty about natural causes, we don\u2019t want to be creating people that just blindly accept whatever came before them as the truth. We want to move forward. So Pascal\u2019s father, with an incredible amount of foresight, decides to keep him out of the school system and educate him at home. Pascal talks about how his father didn\u2019t dive right in to teaching him stuff from the very beginning\u2026no he spent a lot of the time at the beginning just talking to him about the subjects in general. His father would talk to him about what mathematics is in a broad sense and why it is important\u2026and because of this approach it apparently really got Blaise Pascal excited about doing it. His father actually forbid him to study math until the time was right and this cause him to want to do it so bad, the story goes that by the age of something absurdly young like 11 years old he had independently worked out all of the geometrical axioms that Euclid had laid out millennium ago. I wanna try that with my kids when I have them one day\u2026You can play all the video games you want\u2026I\u2019ll buy you all the drugs you want\u2026but one thing that is NOT gonna fly under my roof is Immanuel Kant. That book is forbidden. It is to stay on the shelf at all times.\n\nSo anyway\u2026this extremely novel approach to education coupled with a genius mind and the luxury of being born into incredibly interesting times gave Blaise Pascal a very unique perspective on truth. Truth, as we\u2019ve talked about on several shows, is a very slippery thing. But to Blaise Pascal, being the generation that everyone is looking to to solve this problem of science and truth\u2026people thought it would come out of his generation if it came at all. Blaise Pascal in particular had a very hard time proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that scientific truth was possible at all. In this way, he shared the struggle of one Rene Descartes, but the good news was that it didn\u2019t matter to Pascal anyway. He thought that we COULD arrive at religious truth, but scientific truth was impossible to achieve. The reason why is something very similar to what Montaigne talked about, who Pascal was influenced by tremendously: that is that the scientific truth of today is tomorrow\u2019s punchline. We are constantly, especially in the times of Pascal, PROVING things to be true and then finding out in a couple years that the mechanisms we were using to measure it or collect whatever it is we were trying to prove were flawed from the start. But look, don\u2019t get Pascal wrong here. He isn\u2019t using this as a basis to denounce ALL of science. The reason he is saying this is so that we NEVER STOP LOOKING! So that we never grow complacent. The last thing Pascal wants is for us to arrive at something we determine to be scientific TRUTH and then say ok! dust our hands off and move on to other things. We should NEVER consider anything in science to be absolute truth, that is a dangerous precedent to set.\n\nThis is not only a very central and important point within the thought of Blaise Pascal, but it something all of us can relate to in our own lives and something that is a very special idea to me. Do you know what three words are the most honest words you can ever say? I don\u2019t know. Try it sometime when somebody asks you a question about something important that you SHOULD have thoughts on. There is never a time when I feel more confident about how well I know about a subject than after I just finish reading the first book I\u2019ve ever read on it. I feel like an authority on the subject. I feel like going out and educating all my friends and coworkers, because now I feel like I know everything about it. At least that\u2019s how I used to be the first couple times because what inevitably happens is I read another book on the subject and that confidence dwindles a bit. Suddenly the picture isn\u2019t so clear\u2026now there are all these other things to consider\u2026now my thoughts on it can\u2019t be relegated to a single tag line\u2026it is a couple-three tag lines now. And then I listen to experts talk about the subject and I feel a little less confident\u2026and then I start to seek out the opposing viewpoints of what I believe and I start to realize there are a lot of really intelligent people with great arguments on the other side of this issue too and then I start to see how deep the rabbit hole goes and how which side of the issue is right or wrong really hinges on things that nobody can predict and nobody has control over.\n\nThis process has been my ENTIRE adult life. The first time I ever wanted to educate myself on American Politics, I was looking for a place to be educated about it and the first thing I ran across was conservative talk radio. For like, six months of my life all I listened to was Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin and I can\u2019t imagine how different of a person I would be today if I just assumed these people were right and what I mean by that is that I took the first thing that presented itself to me and accepted it as the gospel truth. It would have been much, much easier for me to never question anything. To grow complacent.\n\nAnd this is what Blaise pascal was worried about when it came to the human race moving forward scientifically. Let\u2019s not, figuratively speaking, listen to a few episodes of Sean Hannity around election time and think that we know everything about the universe. Pascal says, why don\u2019t we never be satisfied? Why not ALWAYS keep looking for more?\n\nSo this is a noble cause and one that I would think most people listening to this agrees with, but it brings up very real implications when it comes to our lives. The most notable of which is probably: If we can\u2019t know anything about this natural world that we exist in for CERTAIN\u2026where does that leave us? I mean, isn\u2019t that a really weird task? How do you navigate a world where you know nothing for certain\u2026\n\nWell, Blaise Pascal and a couple of his mathematician contemporaries were already trying to solve a problem that was much, much more important but dealt with the same kind of thing. Pascal focused on the REAL problems\u2026How can two people\u2026if they are in the middle of a gambling bout\u2026whatever it is and they have to stop the game early\u2026how should these two people divide up the stakes evenly and fairly? Certainly the guy that is ahead at the time they decide to stop it shouldnt just be declared the winner. But then again, is it fair to the players to just split the money based on where the players were when the game was stopped? I mean, what if one person had a statistical advantage to win the game but was on a bad streak?\n\nLeave it to Pascal to find a revolutionary solution to a problem. He laid the foundations for probability theory and expected value. Two things that we can\u2019t imagine not existing today and two things that offer us some insight into how Pascal thought about decision making in our personal lives. Let\u2019s talk about how Pascal solved his friend\u2019s gambling problem; let\u2019s talk about expected value.\n\nLet\u2019s say that I have a die: a six sided cube. 1 through 6 written on the sides and I tell you that for just $1 you can have a chance at winning $10. Here\u2019s how the game works: you pick one of the numbers\u2026let\u2019s say you pick 5 for example\u2026you give me a dollar\u2026I roll the dice and if it comes up on ANYTHING but 5 you lose your dollar, but if it comes up on five you win $10. Should you take that bet?\n\nThe answer should be an immediate and resounding YES. The reason why is because this bet has a positive expected value. Let\u2019s talk about why. You have a 1 in 6 chance of winning ten dollars and a 5 in 6 chance of losing a dollar. For every six tries, you should win ten dollars. How much does it cost you to roll the die six times? Six dollars. For every six dollars that you spend, statistically speaking you should win 10 dollars. You may the first 100 times in a row, but eventually, if you played long enough you would be in the black. By the way, if someone ever actually offers you this bet and you lose the first 100 throws, I would just stop\u2026he is probably scamming you.\n\nThe way Pascal would be explaining it is by assigning values to each potential outcome. In the case of the die, numbers 1,2,3,4 and 6 would have a value of -1, because we paid a dollar to roll the die and we lost that dollar. The number 5 would have a value of 9, not 10 because remember we paid a dollar in to try to win before we rolled it. All you math buffs out there know that there is a mathematical formula to calculate this and for the record it is much better because you can account for things much more complex than a roll of the dice. But for the sake of an audio program, add up all the values. 1,2,3,4, and 6 are -1 so we\u2019re at -5 plus 9 for the value if we rolled a 5 and what do you get? 4. A Positive number. This wager can be said to have what\u2019s known as a positive expected value, or +EV in gambling lingo.\n\nThis is how professional gamblers think about things. You may ask\u2026professional gambler? What skill are they a professional at, pulling the lever of a slot machine? No, it is calculating the expected value of various wagers. Professional gamblers are experts at wagering their money in places that yield a positive expected value. They may lose 100 gambles in a row, but it doesn\u2019t matter to them because as long as they keep \u201cgetting their money in good\u201d as they say or wagering on +EV bets, in the long run, with enough times wagering, they should be profitable.\n\nThe significance of this, the revolutionary thing that Pascal can teach us is that rolling a dice is not as chaotic and random as it might initially seem\u2026as it seemed back in the times of Blaise Pascal. When you graph the probability of certain outcomes, you are left with a bell curve. A high occurrence of certain outcomes that makes up the tall part of the graph and the lower portions of the graph made up of outliers. A SINGLE roll of the dice may be unpredictable, but over time, if we keep rolling the dice thousands and thousands of times and make a graph of the results\u2026that graph is symmetrical. Therefore, Pascal reasoned, the roll of a dice, or some seemingly random and chaotic event is actually quite predictable.\n\nNow knowing the benefits of making +EV gambling decisions over the long term can help us understand Pascal\u2019s Wager better. Now we can see what Pascal was talking about. There are no certainties in this life. Each and every decision and action we make is a risk, to Pascal. His basis for saying that it is impractical not to believe in God is that while in this state of uncertainty and risk, ALL you can do as a wise person is make a +EV play in life and hope for the best. When it comes to the nature of existence, he argued that that included a belief in the Christian God, but I don\u2019t think many of us would argue with his point when it comes to every other decision in life.\n\nHow can we navigate living in a world where we can never arrive at scientific truth? We make +EV decisions. Now it should be said that when it comes to life, calculating +EV decisions becomes ENORMOUSLY harder than calculating it when it comes to the roll of the dice. The reason why is because there are just so many variables. See, in the dice game you are wagering your money, and that\u2019s it. When it comes to life, you are wagering all kinds of stuff, your time, your emotional state, your health\u2026and it comes even more complex when you think in terms of what you are winning by betting. But by and large, these calculated risks that pascal talks about, using the best information you have and trying to yield a positive expected value is what separates people who succeed at creating a good life for themselves and those who fail.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about an example of this. Barrack Obama. President of the United States. Like his politics or not, the guy is pretty tremendous as a human being. He is effective, hardworking and what he has constructed for himself in this life is incredibly impressive. Now every decision that he has made throughout his life can be thought of as a gamble, similar to the dice game we laid out earlier. He could\u2019ve made many BAD decisions that he didn\u2019t. Well, those decisions are kind of like a street hustler coming up to him, telling him about a dice game where he bets 5 dollars for a chance to win 6 dollars. Barrack Obama said no to those games. The decision to drop out of prep school and sit around collecting unemployment playing video games and watching sports wasn\u2019t a +EV decision. So he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nI like to think of Barrack Obama as the physical manifestation of thousands of gambles made with a positive expected value. Barrack Obama is the equivalent of the bulging wad of money that makes up a professional gambler\u2019s bankroll. So at the risk of the secret service storming my condo and taking me away, I\u2019d like to continue this thought experiment a little and imagine if Barrack Obama had a lot of bad things occurring in his life, one after the other after the other. Because after all, betting a dollar to win 10 on that dice game is NO GUARANTEE of success. You could theoretically not roll a five thousands of times in a row. In that same way, you can make great decisions in your life and just get tremendously unlucky over and over and over. Let\u2019s pretend it happened to Obama. Let\u2019s pretend he gets kicked out of office. Michelle leaves him, his kids want nothing to do with him. He loses every penny he\u2019s ever earned. He hands in his resume at 100 businesses and no one gives him an interview. He has no where to stay but on Dick Cheney\u2019s couch and then HE kicks him out. Picture a series of events so unfortunate that the former president of the United States finds himself living under a bridge for a night trying to develop a plan.\n\nWell what would Pascal say? We live in an uncertain world! This was possible all along! There is no guarantee of success\u2026What can we do about it other than continue to make the best calculated decisions we possibly can and hope for the best. I believe that no matter how low someone like Barrack Obama EVER found himself, eventually, with enough rolls of the dice making +EV decisions, he would be immensely successful again.\n\nWhile trying to relate someones life to the probability of success with the roll of a dice is pretty much a lost cause, consider something for a second. What separates someone blindly rolling the dice and somebody that understands the expected value of that dice roll comes down to looking at all of the potential outcomes. The professional gambler thinks about each number that could pop up on the die: He says at some level\u2026OK if it comes up 1 then I lost a dollar. Am I willing to accept that? How likely is that to happen? Where will I be tomorrow if that happens? And so on. He does this with all the numbers 1 \u2013 6. In that same way, Barrack Obama weighs all of the potential outcomes when making +EV decisions in his personal life. Whenever he makes a decision he thinks of all the possible paths he could take to get there. Like numbers on a die. He thinks about the cost associated with each path. He thinks about worst case scenario. Etc.\n\nIf nothing else, it is really interesting to consider the fact that many times what lands people in bad situations is a lack of considering all possible options and what the consequences of each of them are. Like the professional gambler, like Barrack Obama, Pascal would advocate deep thought on major decisions in your life to insure that you make the best calculated risk possible.\n\nAll of this leads to what we talked about at the beginning: what Blaise Pascal refers to as \u201cThe supreme paradox of creation\u201d that man livings in a perpetual state of both the highest grandeur and the biggest misery. See, we as humans are at least a little bit different than all the other animals of the animal kingdom. At least ostensibly. We have the magical power of foresight. We have the ability to weigh the pros and cons of our decisions. We have the ability to imagine an electronic device that will change the lives of millions of people and bring it to market. You know the common reflection on the world that everything around you, every table, every building, every book, everything was at one point just a figment of someone\u2019s imagination. This imagination and this gift of foresight has allowed us to manipulate our environment much more than any other creature. It has allowed us to improve the quality of our lives more than any other creature. It leaves us in the highest state of grandeur in the animal kingdom.\n\nOn the other hand, that same ability also leaves us in a state of the deepest misery. Because it allows us the ability to imagine a life better than what we can ever possibly achieve. Pascal isn\u2019t talking class warfare here, although it certainly applies to people that think they are stuck in whatever economic situation they are in. Pascal is talking about the inevitability of being a human. What is the only certainty in life? Death. Death, pain, suffering\u2026these are things that we ALL experience sporadically, some more often than others. But Pascal points out that our ability to imagine also allows us to imagine a life devoid of death, pain and suffering and because of this we feel poisoned with no possible remedy.\n\nPascal talks alot about the power and detriment of using your imagination. He said it is an incredibly complicated thing to master because it is both right and wrong on occasion, but there is no way for us to know which it is when we are imagining it. He talks about how we use our minds to impose characteristics on people based on incomplete information. He talks about when we see someone dressed in a uniform or dressed importantly, we tend to take their thoughts more seriously than someone dressed like Barrack Obama under the bridge. Pascal asks, what is that really based on? A half-inch thick piece of fabric hung over their skin?\n\nOn the surface this may seem trivial, but the point he is getting at is an important one. This single thing that we call the imagination brought into being every great piece of technology and progress in human history, but simultaneously it serves to misguide us and imagine things that might hurt us. The implications of this are that VERY IMPORTANT THINGS like our sense of what happiness is or what justice is, these things could be as flimsy as our judgment of the guy dressed in rags.\n\n\u201cImagination disposes of everything; it creates beauty, justice, and happiness, which are everything in this world.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_28": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 33 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #033 Spinoza pt. 1. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nFor us to truly understand who Baruch De Spinoza was we need to put ourselves in his shoes. One thing that\u2019s really easy to do as you\u2019re trying to learn stuff about history is to look at these people as though they\u2019re just some guy that you met at the mall on a Saturday. I feel like, we learn things about people, we experience their personality and we judge them. Sometimes, and I was guilty of this for a long time, we don\u2019t fully consider the fact that these people might as well be from another planet than us. What frame of reference do we have when looking at someone like Spinoza? At least when you think of primitive man and what it must have been like to live as a hunter gatherer, at least we can look at modern hunter gatherers\u2026Papau New Guinea, the Kalahari Bushmen, people like that, we coexist with hunter gatherers. There is no where on earth today that really mimics the sort of political or religious uncertainty that pervades this time period were talking about and there aren\u2019t many places that can mimic the sort of ruthless, gruesome acts that are being committed in the name of these competing interests.\n\nAnd it\u2019s entirely complicated because there is SO MUCH change going on in the world at such a rapid pace\u2026there isn\u2019t just one war going on. This time period can\u2019t be characterized by saying two religious views were butting heads\u2026or that faith and reason were butting heads\u2026this intellectual war spread across the entire continent of Europe and there were dozens of battles taking place simultaneously in this sharknado of change.\n\nThis rapid change is what makes this one of the most fascinating points in history and it is impossible to list or describe all the different areas where things were changing\u2026and even if it was I wouldn\u2019t do it\u2026that\u2019s not what this show is about. But what I can do, is talk about one of these scenes that took place during Spinoza\u2019s life that illustrates the sort of world that he found himself living in. This event crushed Spinoza and it can give us some insight into how he was forced to act during his lifetime. How the events of his life shaped his behavior. This is the story of Johan De Witt.\n\nSo one of these battles that were going on in this larger intellectual war zone had to do with government. What is the role of government in a civilized society? How should the government implement its strategy? How coercive is it justified to be when meeting its goals? Lots of questions. And just like in modern times where there are fights going on between special interest groups and one special interest group may hire a lobbyist to try to influence legislation or they might start an organization that is dedicated to pushing forward their agenda, specific \u201cpolitical\u201d special interest groups back in the time of Spinoza organized in a similar way. Not everybody wanted their government to be a republic, which was becoming an increasingly popular thing around there at the time. One of these \u201cspecial interest groups\u201d was called orangism.\n\nNow at first glance orangism\u2026sounds pretty good! I mean, what\u2019s wrong with oranges? Well it had nothing to do with the fruit, they were supporters of what was known as the House of Orange-Nassau at the time, essentially a big group of people that wanted a monarchist form of government whose sole purpose was to oppose the other big political group at the time who was trying to erect a republic. The fanaticism of these people. The idea of a mob of people organizing together and willing to conspire and lie and commit terrible acts of violence against someone who just didn\u2019t agree with them about something.\n\nJohan De Witt was the recently deposed leader of the pro-republic political group at the time and he was seen, by some, as one of the most brilliant political minds in the world and by others as an enormous threat. See there was this wave of change going through Europe, but just like many points in history where there are changes going on of this magnitude, what inevitably happens is that not everybody wants to change. No matter how bad things used to be, there are people that BENEFITTED from the way it used to be and they are going to fight to keep things the same. They\u2019re going to rally people. They\u2019re going to organize. They\u2019re going to do whatever they need to do to return things back to normal.\n\nSo on August 20th 1672, they did what they had to do. Johan De Witt was visiting his brother in prison who was being held on a charge of attempted murder that was almost unanimously considered to be false. There was a mob of people working on behalf of the House of Orange who were waiting for him when he exited the prison with his brother. There are stories of how the ring leader of the mob told the guard who was supposed to be watching the area during the time\u2026that a couple farmers were stealing stuff and that he needed to go check it out, but it was just to give Johan De Witt zero chance of survival. What happened next is one of the most horrific scenes you\u2019ll ever read about:\n\n\u201cevery one of the miscreants, emboldened by his [Johan\u2019s] fall, wanted to fire his gun at him, or strike him with blows of the sledge-hammer, or stab him with a knife or swords, every one wanted to draw a drop of blood from the fallen hero, and tear off a shred from his garments.\n\nAnd after having mangled, and torn, and completely stripped the two brothers, the mob dragged their naked and bloody bodies to an extemporized gibbet, where amateur executioners hung them up by the feet.\n\nThen came the most dastardly scoundrels of all, who not having dared to strike the living flesh, cut the dead in pieces, and then went about the town selling small slices of the bodies of John and Cornelius at ten sous a piece.\u201d\n\nThis mob of people first beat and stabbed them to death, then they stripped them naked, hung their bodies upside down and cut them into pieces and sold them around the town. There are other accounts that they cut out their hearts and either ate them, or put them on display at one of the ring leaders houses\u2026like a souvenir baseball he caught at a baseball game. Let\u2019s keep this in perspective\u2026they did all of this because they didn\u2019t agree with someone.\n\nThis is something that we should talk about when thinking about this time period. There are a lot of people that oversimplify what causes gruesome violence like this to occur. They\u2019ll say stuff like \u201creligion should be abolished because, look at all the terrible atrocities that have been committed in the name of religion!\u201d 9/11, the crusades, all the bloodshed during the reformation\u2026what these people fail to realize is that religion is not the problem. Look at this example that we\u2019re talking about with Johann De Witt. This guy was torn apart and eaten by a mob of people for a political cause. Should we abolish government because of that? Dictators have invaded countries and killed millions of people in the name of some nationalistic sentiment. You know, we did this for the good of America! Just like it is possible to have a country that doesn\u2019t commit genocide in the name of nationalism\u2026it is possible to have a religion that doesn\u2019t subjugate, enslave or kill people in the name of their religion. There is an Indian religion whose origins go WAY back to around the 7th century BC and it\u2019s called Jainism. Now if you\u2019re a follower of Jainism, you live by a strict principle of non-violence towards ALL living creatures. That is the ultimate good. It is just a beautiful religion\u2026the promote complete equality among all living things and they wouldn\u2019t ever THINK of mobbing together and disemboweling someone, let alone fly planes into buildings.\n\nMy point is not to find an exception to a rule and say that people are wrong\u2026my point is that if it is possible to have a religion like Jainism, and many other religions that don\u2019t have violent extremists, if it is possible for those to exist, then maybe there is something that underlies religion that is the real problem. Maybe that thing can ALSO be found in all of these other things, like the Orangists from the story we just told, or people that commit violence in the name of their country. Maybe the real problem is man\u2019s ability to attach themselves to a tribe and marginalize other groups of people that don\u2019t agree with them. And if you are someone that truly wants the violence to stop and not someone that just has an ax to grind with religion, you can see that abolishing religion doesn\u2019t solve the problem, it just delays it.\n\nWe can see this in the example of Johann De Witt.\n\nSpinoza was absolutely devastated when this happened. Leibniz, a contemporary and friend of Spinoza and the third of the great continental rationalists wrote later about Spinoza telling him about the day when the mob attacked them:\n\nI have spent several hours with Spinoza, after dinner. He said to me that, on the day of the massacres of the De Witts, he wanted to go out at night and post a placard near the site of the massacres reading ultimi barbarorum. But his host locked the house to keep him from going out, for he would be exposed to being torn to pieces.\n\nSpinoza was so angry at these people, so mad at them for massacring \u201creason itself\u201d\u2026that he painted what amounted to a big piece of poster board and wanted to post it at the murder site calling the mob the most ruthless of barbarians imaginable. The only reason he didn\u2019t is because his landlord locked him in his house because he didn\u2019t want him to get killed to. That landlord may be the sole reason I am recording this episode right now.\n\nThis story really encapsulates the character of Spinoza throughout his entire life: dedicated to reason. Strong, stood by his beliefs no matter the cost. Living in a world of people who were not his intellectual equal, groups of people willing to commit terrible acts of violence against people that merely disagreed with them, and Spinoza having beliefs that disagreed with almost everybody.\n\nBut more than that, Spinoza embodies what this whole time period was about. I mean, the way he made his living was by grinding lenses for telescopes and microscopes. There is no job that is more \u201cscientific revolution\u201d than that. If you were making a movie about someone from this era and his occupation was lens grinder, the writers would tell you that it was TOO over the top.\n\nSpinoza grew up Jewish. He was a proud, card carrying member of the nation of Israel until the age of 22 when his father died and he didn\u2019t need to keep his opinions quiet anymore for fear of embarrassing him. He was living during the time of the Spanish Inquisition which created a pretty interesting and complex situation for you if you were Jewish or any religious authority in the nation of Israel. Above all else, they wanted to keep Spinoza quiet.\n\nSee, Spinoza had this long upbringing of what we would equate in modern times to catholic school. He talks about it being this long, monotonous slog through the Jewish religious texts and the old testament and what eventually happens is Spinoza thinks the story is childish. He said this God that is portrayed in the Old Testament, how can anyone honestly believe that this is true? And if it is true, is this the God that you want to exist under? No, God is nothing like this, what some guys wrote about in this really old book that you guys are following. He thought that whoever wrote the Torah wasn\u2019t a bad person, they understandably had no idea about science or cosmology, but let\u2019s not pretend like they did. He said that these miracles that are written about most likely were just natural events that were misunderstood by humans and recorded to be supernatural acts to give credence to the set of behaviors that are attached to them. He talks about how God could never be relegated to a human form\u2026God didn\u2019t say \u201clet there be light\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have a hand that he reaches down with and touches you. God is much, much more than that to Spinoza. God is an infinite being that could never be described in these sorts of terms.\n\nNow, we\u2019re going to do a whole episode on Spinoza\u2019s God because it is an incredibly fascinating and useful worldview, but the significance of this right now is that, with views like this, he obviously wasn\u2019t fitting into a world where the nation of Israel has the Spanish Inquisition going on and would love it if he would just keep his mouth shut. The authority at the synagogue would say, \u201cJust\u2026Cmon Spinoza\u2026keep it down a bit alright. Just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t going to keep it down anymore. Spinoza was a man of his convictions. They wanted him to be quiet so badly that\u2026in his twenties\u2026they offered him 1000 florens a month to just NOT make his opinions known about stuff. Just for some perspective, most people were surviving back then on about 2500 florens a YEAR, so 1000 florens a month is similar to being paid a six-figure salary in today\u2019s world just to keep your mouth shut. Spinoza turned it down. No instead, what he decided to do is send the Jewish authorities a comprehensive mathematical structured outline of all of his views, what they were and how they are in his opinion irrefutable because they are as self-evident as the mathematical truth that a triangle has three angles that equal 180 degrees.\n\nHe left them no choice. In July of 1656 they did this ridiculous ritual where they blow the \u201cgreat horn\u201d\u2026they all are holding candles that they put out one by one and then they literally tried to curse him. They read this really cryptically worded scary sounding passage that hereby banished Spinoza from . Nobody is allowed to help him. Nobody is allowed to talk to him. He is a marked person who is not part of their group anymore.\n\nWhat followed for Spinoza was a life of a lot of solitude. Some people say that there were stretches where you wouldn\u2019t see him leave his house for three months at a time. He tells stories about how he would sit alone and collect spiders and watch them fight each other. Or that he would collect flies and put one in a spiders web and just laugh maniacally as it struggled to get away. If he lived today he could just watch animal planet like a normal person\u2026but it is interesting to think about how lonely it must have felt to be so intelligent surrounded by people that mostly can\u2019t relate to you. But he tried his hardest\u2026and he did write a lot of letters throughout his life. One of the most famous and one of the most illuminating of Spinoza and the way that he thought about things is one with an old friend of his named Albert Burgh. Before he was banished from Israel he was really good friends with Albert, but eventually they went their separate ways, Spinoza to a life of solitude and Albert became a Christian.\n\nWell, eventually Albert gets word throug the grapevine of how godless and terrible Spinoza\u2019s views on existence were and he decides to send him a letter, claiming to be doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying to get him to become a Christian. Albert spends a lot of his letter attacking Spinoza\u2019s views and giving the best argument he can for why Christianity is the best choice and why Spinoza should abandon this rootless, selfish existence and join the church of Rome. Now, I\u2019m going to read an excerpt from the letter and just put yourself in Spinoza\u2019s shoes as he is reading this. Just listen to the arrogance. Just imagine getting a letter from what used to be your best friend and they are condemning you and making you feel as though you are inferior to them. Here\u2019s what Albert closes his letter with:\n\n\u201cI have written this letter to you with intentions truly Christian; first, in order to show the love I bear to you, though you are a heathen; secondly, in order to beg you not to persist in converting others.\n\nI therefore will thus conclude: God is willing to snatch your soul from eternal damnation, if you will allow Him. Do not doubt that the Master, who has called you so often through others, is now calling you for the last time through me, who having obtained grace from the ineffable mercy of God Himself, beg the same for you with my whole heart. Do not deny me. For if you do not now give ear to God who calls you, the wrath of the Lord will be kindled against you, and there is a danger of your being abandoned by His infinite mercy, and becoming a wretched victim of the Divine Justice which consumes all things in wrath. Such a fate may Almighty God avert for the greater glory of His name, and for the salvation of your soul, also for a salutary example for the imitation of your most unfortunate and idolatrous followers, through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who with the Eternal Father liveth and reigneth in the Unity of the Holy Spirit, God for all Eternity. Amen.\u201d\n\nSo like I said before, we can all imagine how insulted Spinoza must have felt. Especially if we consider that he sees all of these religions as ultimately the same thing and even the one that was crammed into his head throughout his youth wasn\u2019t good enough for him. Listening to this old friend tell him how lucky he is that God is giving him one last chance to accept the narrative..listening to him end his letter like he\u2019s ending a Sunday Mass\u2026you know God for all eternity..Amen. This must have made him pull his hair out of his head. Spinoza replies and both categorically destroys all of the arguments Albert lays out in his letter and does it while mixing in sarcasm that is still funny 400 years later.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cThat, which I could scarcely believe when told me by others, I learn at last from your own letter; not only have you been made a member of the Romish Church, but you are become a very keen champion of the same, and have already learned wantonly to insult and rail against your opponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you seem to wish to employ reason, and ask me, \u201cHow I know that my philosophy is the best among all that have ever been taught in the world, or are being taught, or ever will be taught?\u201d a question which I might with much greater right ask you; for I do not presume that I have found the best philosophy, I know that I understand the true philosophy. If you ask in what way I know it, I answer: In the same way as you know that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles: that this is sufficient, will be denied by no one whose brain is sound, and who does not go dreaming of evil spirits inspiring us with false ideas like the true. For the truth is the index of itself and of what is false.\n\nBut you; who presume that you have at last found the best religion, or rather the best men, on whom you have pinned your credulity, you, \u201cwho know that they are the best among all who have taught, do now teach, or shall in future teach other religions. Have you examined all religions, ancient as well as modern, taught here and in India and everywhere throughout the world? And, if you have duly examined them, how do you know that you have chosen the best\u201d since you can give no reason for the faith that is in you? But you will say, that you acquiesce in the inward testimony of the Spirit of God, while the rest of mankind are ensnared and deceived by the prince of evil spirits. But all those outside the pale of the Romish Church can with equal right proclaim of their own creed what you proclaim of yours.\u201d\n\nReading this letter from a guy written in the 1600\u2019s is just incredible to me. Spinoza was just an unquestionable genius. You can read this letters in their entirety on the website this week. I will post links to them on the episode page. But just so that we can get a little more insight into the human that was Baruch De Spinoza, lets take a look at one of the arguments that Albert gives him citing the legitimacy of Christianity over the other religions. He says that the reason it has merit is that it spread faster than any other religion and it was spread by a bunch of uneducated Hebrews at that. Now, the point that Albert is making is that the success of something like that cant be just sophistry or word play\u2026it\u2019s not some charismatic priest a little smarter than everyone standing up there and outwitting them. There must be some divine backing to this one. That is Albert\u2019s point.\n\nSpinoza responds to this here:\n\nIf, therefore, you had rightly judged, you would have seen that only your third point tells in favour of the Christians, namely, that unlearned and common men should have been able to convert nearly the whole world to a belief in Christ. But this reason militates not only for the Romish Church, but for all those who profess the name of Christ.\n\nBut assume that all the reasons you bring forward tell in favour solely of the Romish Church. Do you think that you can thereby prove mathematically the authority of that Church? As the case is far otherwise, why do you wish me to believe that my demonstrations are inspired by the prince of evil spirits, while your own are inspired by God, especially as I see, and as your letter clearly shows, that you have been led to become a devotee of this Church not by your love of God, but by your fear of hell, the single cause of superstition? Is this your humility, that you trust nothing to yourself, but everything to others, who are condemned by many of their fellow men?\n\nDo you set it down to pride and arrogance, that I employ reason and acquiesce in this true Word of God, which is in the mind and can never be depraved or corrupted? Cast away this deadly superstition, acknowledge the reason which God has given you, and follow that, unless you would be numbered with the brutes.\u201d\n\nSo if there is something we can take from this episode, aside from diving into the intellect and person that was Spinoza, what we should take from this is that the world Spinoza was living in was both a welcoming place to new ideas and potentially a very dangerous place for new ideas. The fact that holding different opinions could have you ripped limb from limb or cut into pieces and sold around town, that dynamic is ultimately what forced Spinoza to never release his principle work called Ethics. He died in 1677 and that very same year it was released by his friends without his name as the author. Now, you may be wondering, why do I care about some guy from the 1600\u2019s and his interpretation of what God is? Well let me leave you today with a question\u2026if a belief in the Christian or Jewish God justifies a certain set of behaviors\u2026what set of behaviors would Spinoza\u2019s God justify? If we as humans are not all individual unique snowflakes with a God that knows our first name\u2026what are we? And what does that mean about how we should act on this mortal coil? Thank you for listening, I will talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_29": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 34 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #034 Spinoza pt. 2.

This is a good one. This is a poem written about Baruch de Spinoza, let\u2019s hear what this person has to say about him:\n\n\u201cHow much do I love this noble man\n\nMore than I could say with words\n\nI fear though he\u2019ll remain alone\n\nWith a holy halo of his own\u2026\n\nYou think his example would show us\n\nWhat this teaching can give humankind\n\nTrust not the comforting fa\u00e7ade:\n\nOne must be born sublime\u201d\n\nThat poem was written by a guy named Albert Einstein. He was a big fan of Spinoza if you couldn\u2019t tell, most notably he was a fan of Spinoza\u2019s concept of God. He seems to think in that poem that humankind has something substantial to gain from what Spinoza showed us and that we should \u201ctrust not the comforting facade\u201d. What is he talking about here?\n\nWell trust me, it ALL is going to come together by the end of the show today, but like all great things there is a bit of a back story we need to get through first and it starts with one word: substance.\n\nSo, as we\u2019ve been going through the history of philosophy we\u2019ve heard a lot of things. One thing that has come up pretty commonly among thinkers from all kinds of different backgrounds and time periods is the idea of God being an infinite being. Whatever God is to them, there is one thing that must be true and that is that he is an infinite being.\n\nSometimes as I read that statement I like to just sit and nod while I say it so that I\u2019m more likely to agree with it. But is that statement as infallible as it seems? And if it is true, what else needs to be true? I mean, if God is truly an infinite being, then can anything ever be OUTSIDE of God? As many of you know I have an English Bulldog named Charlie who snores and slobbers everywhere and smells terrible. Is my dog Charlie outside of God? Yes? Well if God is infinite how can he be? The fact that he exists and he is NOT God shows that at least in some small capacity god is limited and is therefore NOT infinite. If you say that God\u2019s love exists in everything, how do you account for the physical matter or any other attribute of Charlie that is separate. If God is infinite, then my dog charlie needs to be part of him. But on that same note, if God is infinite, don\u2019t we all need to be a part of him?\n\nThis was a thought that Spinoza might have wished he could go back and prevent himself from ever having it in the first place\u2026it made his life vastly more complicated than it would be had he never thought of it. Let\u2019s talk about where it came from. Spinoza was a continental rationalist. One of the big three: Descartes Spinoza Leibniz. In many ways Spinoza was commenting on and continuing thoughts that Descartes brought up during his lifetime. And as we talked about on the Descartes episodes\u2026 Descartes brought A LOT of new ideas to the region in his lifetime. One idea that Descartes talks about quite a bit in his quest to find a universal mathematical order to the universe is substance. For the record this is something that Aristotle talked about a bit as well and Descartes can really be seen as re purposing and rethinking through the idea of substance that he laid out centuries before. Descartes defined substance: and this is important! That whose existence is not dependent on any other thing. This is a very nicely packaged way of saying it. You have Descartes sounding a lot like Aristotle at certain points of his writing where he talks about wax by a fire. When you melt the wax, everything changes about it. The consistency turns to liquid, the shape changes to the shape of the bowl, the color changes: but no one would argue with you if you said that it was the same wax as before. What exactly are we talking about when we say wax if so much can change about it but we still see it as the same thing?\n\nNow this is the point of the episode where this could easily devolve down into me talking about attributes of things, modes of things, but let\u2019s talk about substance right now. We have to understand that Descartes spent his life trying to refute radical skeptics and find a way to show that what we see in the world is not just a giant illusion. Remember his evil demon that at least COULD be constantly deceiving you? Descartes set out in his philosophy to deliberately prove that what we are experiencing is accurate if we study it hard enough. Spinoza on the other hand said that there was a whole lot more to reality that we couldn\u2019t see directly.\n\nSubstance to Descartes is that whose existence is not dependent on any other thing. Spinoza largely accepts this in his work but he rephrases it a little and says that substance is that in which its existence explains itself. Now lets think about that for a second\u2026lets think of an example. When I pick up an iPhone, does that phone\u2019s existence explain itself?\n\nThe answer is no. Far from it. You can do a lot of fun things with a smart phone\u2026you can access satellites with it and call your friends\u2026.you can surf the internet\u2026you can spend twenty bucks on some bizarre rainbow fruit game. You can do a lot of stuff, but what all these things have in common is that they can\u2019t be understood by themselves, they need to be understood in RELATION to some other concept. In fact, just as a little experiment, could we describe what an iPhone is to someone without using anything but the nature of the phone?\n\nSpinoza thinks the answer is no. After all, how can you describe what a phone is without referencing something else? You\u2019d say something like, oh you use it to talk to your friends! Well, what is talk? What is the concept of communication that you\u2019re talking about? Can\u2019t we break it down into smaller pieces and understand it by itself, not in relation to something else? Alright, uh, it processes data! What is processing? What is data? The phone is not self-explanatory.\n\nSpinoza says: A definition, if it is to be called perfect, must explain the inmost essence of a thing, and must take care not to substitute for this any of its properties. In order to illustrate my meaning, without taking an example which would seem to show a desire to expose other people\u2019s errors, I will choose the case of something abstract, the definition of which is of little moment. Such is a circle. If a circle be defined as a figure, such that all straight lines drawn from the center to the circumference are equal, every one can see that such a definition does not in the least explain the essence of a circle, but solely one of its properties.\n\nThis is similar to what we talked about with some of the Medieval philosophers like Avicenna who talked about the difference between necessary and contingent existents. Contingent existents rely on something else to exist\u2026like I rely on my mom and dad to be born in the first place. 99.9% of things are contingent on something else to exist.\n\nWell this is one of those classic questions from philosophy: is there anything out there that exists necessarily. Let\u2019s just think about that for a second. Now if you\u2019re a Christian or a believer in some God the answer of this question is going to be easy for you, but if you\u2019re not just try to think of something for a second, see if you come up with what Spinoza comes up with. That for existence to be a possibility it must exist. Spinoza is what is known as a substance monist. If you remember back to the pre-socratics\u2026Thales was a monist because he believed that everything in the cosmos was made of one substance: in his case water in it\u2019s varying forms.\n\nSo Spinoza, as a substance monist believes that there is only one true substance. Spinoza sat down one day and started thinking about Descartes definition of substance: something that\u2019s existence is self-explanatory. And after thinking about it for a long time what he realized is that if that is the definition of substance then there is really only one thing that falls into that category, and that is EVERYTHING. Not every, single thing\u2026EVERYTHING as a whole! The Entirety of it all. The Totality of all existence. Don\u2019t think about you, or your city, or the earth, or the milky way galaxy or even the universe\u2026EVERYTHING as one whole. See all of those smaller pieces are explainable only in relation to something else, but the entire thing, this entire, glowing giant mass of existence, WHEREEVER it ends, if it even does, it is in it\u2019s nature to exist.\n\nNow we come back to what we were touching on before: If God is truly infinite, then how can anything not be a part of him? I mean really, if you are taking up space, and God is infinite, how can you not be a very very small fraction of God? Spinoza says that that totality of existence, everything that is, he calls that God. The really important part is that he ALSO calls that totality nature. Now that\u2019s not something I think a lot of people would disagree with now is it?\n\nI mean, it\u2019s tough doing this show sometimes because when I say that Spinoza calls the totality of all existence \u201cGod\u201d I get resistance from both popular ways that people think in this time period. Religious people think he is an idiot because he doesn\u2019t see God as this man that sees you when your sleeping and knows when your awake\u2026and then on the other end \u2026needlessly hostile atheist people just hear the word God and are just like *scoff* Good old Aesop Spinoza\u2026weaving his fairy tales again.\n\nSo let\u2019s not even use the word God\u2026let\u2019s use the other word that Spinoza thought was synonymous with the totality of everything: Nature. Now, we\u2019re talking right? I mean, think about it: for our whole lives we\u2019ve been told that science is great at identifying patterns of nature\u2026we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that gravity exists, but we can\u2019t ever know WHY gravity exists. We can prove beyond a reasonable doubt how and when life began, but we can never objectively prove WHY life exists at all\u2026or why there is some software programmed into life to evolve and adapt in very calculated ways to the environment.\n\nYou know\u2026if a devoutly religious person and a militant atheist went on a walk through the woods together talking\u2026they would both look around them and marvel at nature. They might disagree on what brought those forces of nature into existence, but they wouldn\u2019t disagree that there is this self-sufficient framework to the universe that is seemingly-ordered. But although in modern times we think of \u201cnature\u201d as what we see when we go camping\u2026does nature really end where the trees end? No, the forces of nature are ubiquitous. They\u2019re everywhere! You grow a plant on your windowsill\u2026does it grow based on a different set of laws than if it grew in the woods? We\u2019ve worked really hard to create these cities that make us feel exterior to nature, but Spinoza has news for you. You\u2019re still part of it. Our Solar System is part of it\u2026the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies are part of it. To Spinoza, each and every thing\u2026including each and every one of us listening to this podcast right now are part of one giant totality. We are all a very small piece of that totality. We are all aspects of God, or Nature.\n\nNow if this is true\u2026if we are all individual facets of God\u2026and God is the totality of all existence\u2026what are the implications of that? Well, one major one is that if God is nature, then God cannot by definition be super-natural. Anything that he does, although it seems like magic to us, is just a part of the natural way of things.\n\nSpinoza said: As regards miracles, I am of opinion that the revelation of God can only be established by the wisdom of the doctrine, not by miracles, or in other words by ignorance.\n\nAnother one is that if God IS nature, and we and everything around us are just a part of God, then God cannot be this transcendent being that sits on a throne and judges who won the ethical obstacle course. He is not a transcendent being\u2026he is an eminent being. He is around us all the time. We are part of him. Keep in mind the only reason I am saying \u201chim\u201d is because it is familiar to people to refer to God this way, but this being is far from having male genitalia or an affinity for sports.\n\nSpinoza talks about how humans have learned to project their characteristics on God, and how it really is only natural. He says that if a triangle could talk\u2026he thinks it would say that God is obviously a triangle.\n\nHe said:\n\nWhen you say that if I deny, that the operations of seeing, hearing, attending, wishing, &c., can be ascribed to God, or that they exist in him in any eminent fashion, you do not know what sort of God mine is ; I suspect that you believe there is no greater perfection than such as can be explained by the aforesaid attributes. I am not astonished ; for I believe that, if a triangle could speak, it would say, in like manner, that God is eminently triangular, while a circle would say that the divine nature is eminently circular. Thus each would ascribe to God its own attributes, would assume itself to be like God, and look on everything else as ill-shaped.\n\nNow it\u2019s important to think about this as we consider God to be the totality of all existence. This is important to consider when we think about the fact that Spinoza considers God to be the cause of everything. Now when I say this, im not just talking about God creating everything\u2026at this point, when philosophy refers to the \u201ccause\u201d of something, they\u2019re usually referring to Aristotle\u2019s four causes. The cause of something is more than just the final cause of something. To Spinoza, this totality of existence, or nature causes everything: It provides the material that it is made out of, it provides through some intricate software that we don\u2019t understand it\u2019s shape and size, it has a purpose for the thing within it\u2019s framework, although we may not understand ours. You know, I was watching a video months ago with Joe Rogan and he said that we, as a species, may need to be willing to accept that the Earth is an orange and that humans are like mold and our job is to eat the orange.\n\nNow there is a lot to disagree with there, but one thing is is effectively talking about is an overarching purpose of the human species, or of life as a whole. You know, if the world is not an ethical proving ground where a supernatural God assesses how nice you are to other humans, what are we exactly? And if you think that humans and the ability to be self-aware is an evolutionary accident, what is the purpose of life as a whole? Well, one of Aristotle\u2019s four causes asks what is the purpose of the thing? And in Spinoza\u2019s philosophical system, Nature explains ours.\n\nThe most important part of all this is that God causes everything to Spinoza. Now if all the things that happen in the world are just one stepping stone in a giant causal chain set in motion by Nature, or God\u2026that changes a lot about the way we have to view the world. One of the most interesting and relevant to us is how it affects the idea of free will.\n\nSee, to Spinoza, our actions are caused by nature. Free-will, to Spinoza is a complete illusion. When someone chooses to go down to the store and buy some Doritos\u2026When someone thinks they are making a spontaneous action completely free of any outside influence, they really are just ignorant of the true causes of their actions.\n\nLike, have you ever been driving down the road or just doing anything in your life and had the same reaction in the same place two days in a row? A reaction that was almost sub-conscious? It\u2019s hard to think of a good example of this\u2026I guess the one that comes to mind is up here in Seattle there is a radio station called \u201cthe rock of seattle\u201d and I drove past a billboard that said \u201cI love the Rock!\u201d and the picture was someone smiling and holding a picture of some pitcher of beer or some alcoholic drink because that\u2019s part of what their demographic is apparently\u2026and I saw this billboard and I just started singing \u201cI love rock and roll\u201d like I was a severely drunk Joan Jett singing her hit song. Look you guys think I like this example? How do you think it feels to be me trapped in this body?\n\nWell the important part of this wonderful story is that I drove past that billboard 2 weeks later\u2026I didn\u2019t even think about it and I saw the same billboard and sung the exact same song\u2026the exact same way. After I did it, I realized wow, my brain is like a really terrible computer program. I get a certain input, the billboard. I filter that input through all of the experiences I\u2019ve had in my life: all of the times I\u2019ve heard drunk people singing, all of the things that relate to the words I Love Rock, and after filtering it through all that stuff I react with the drunken rendition of Joan Jett\u2019s hit song.\n\nThis is what Spinoza is talking about. Do we truly have free-will simply because we feel like we could have made a different decision? Or, are we just ignorant. Like, based on all of our conditioning, all of our life experiences, we really had no choice. We were always going to conclude that the one we chose was the most reasonable based on the software that being a part of Nature affords us.\n\nNow some of you may be saying\u2026what if I decide to just pull my shirt over my head, spin around in a circle and sing stairway to heaven backwards? Surely, THAT is free will because nature could never know that I would make that random decision\u2026well what if all of your life experiences insured that you would be the type of person to contemplate free-will and therefore be the type of person who is more likely to do some super random act like that to prove that you have autonomy.\n\nThere is no escaping it, to Spinoza. If we truly had free-will, we would be causes of ourselves and therefore substances. But there is only one substance. That thing that we are all individual ripples of, God.\n\nHe says: In the Mind there is no absolute, or free, will, but the Mind is determined to will this or that by a cause which is also determined by another, and this again by another, and so to infinity.\n\nJust as we, as physical beings are aspects of this whole of existence and we can be understood by this GIANT causal chain. You know\u2026your mom and dad created you, their mom and dad created them and so on\u2026Just like our physical bodies can be understood based on what caused them, our emotions are the exact same way. The way we feel or are inclined to act is based on some thought that was caused by some other thought and so on and so forth. Again, we can understand things best by understanding the causes of it, and God causes everything.\n\nSpinoza talks about navigating the world and how our actions are either caused by passive or active emotions. Passive emotions are things like anger or frustration. You can see how he may have seen these things as passive\u2026they are very reactionary. If we get cut off in traffic and get angry at the person, we are passively going throughout life and being enslaved by these other things that we allow to affect us. On the other hand there are active emotions. What defines an active emotion is not that it is a good feeling\u2026on the contrary\u2026anger could be an active emotion as well. What separates something from being a passive or active emotion comes down to whether we understand the true cause of the emotion or not.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cAn emotion which is a passion, ceases to be a passion, as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea of it.\u201d\n\nHe says: \u201cI say that we are active when something takes place within us or out of us, of which we are the adequate cause, ie when from our nature something follows either within us or out of us, which can be clearly understood by that nature alone. On the other hand I say that we are passive when something takes place in us or follows from our nature, of which we are only the partial cause.\u201d\n\nHe talks a lot about how we feel like we are at the mercy of this hurricane of complex emotions and decision making, but really, all of these emotions that we think are driving us can be distilled down to a tendency to increase power. That\u2019s what we seem to be programmed to do\u2026that\u2019s what we are all searching for. When we feel joy or good feelings, that\u2019s just the feeling of an increase of power. When we feel sadness, that is merely a decrease of power.\n\nWhen we love something or hate something, we think that we are making some free decision based on our personal tastes\u2026to Spinoza, in reality, it comes down to this striving for power. There\u2019s more to talk about with Spinoza and his ethics but maybe the most powerful notion that we can extract from it this week is this: If we are all aspects of God, then we are parts of one being. Just like it would be ludicrous for your left foot to try to hurt or go to war with your right foot, because their existence depends on each other and really they are both parts of the same being, All humans should see themselves this way too.\n\nBecause of this there is no reason to ever hurt or cause suffering, because by doing so, you are simultaneously causing damage to yourself as well. Thank you for listening, Talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_30": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 35 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #035 on John Locke pt. 1 \u2013 From Sea to Shining Sea. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nI want to begin the show today by asking you all a question that you probably have never asked yourselves before. Are you ready? Here it goes. Who owns your body? I mean, you as a spiritual being, or as a mind that operates this bag of chemicals that you walk around in\u2026who owns that bag of chemicals? Do you think you own it? Why? You just live in it\u2026why does that necessarily mean that you own it? When I was little we got evicted from the apartment complex I was living in and we just continued to live in the apartment. That apartment wasn\u2019t OURS simply because we were still living in it, and this was underscored when a few weeks later the police came in and kicked us out. But no one can really kick you out of your body can they? So who do you pay rent to as a spirit or mind occupying this body? Do you set up some sort of rent to own program?\n\nThis question is pretty ridiculous..and as interesting as it is to think about it really is just trying to get you to say that your body is a part of who you are. When you are born, your body and you for that matter, are self-owned. Figuratively speaking, there is a deed to your body that is signed over to you and you exist in this role of self-ownership. You are entitled to your body at birth, but is it the ONLY thing you are entitled to? What else are you entitled to simply by virtue of being born?\n\nNow that is a question that is interesting to think about for a while. By the way, as these thought experiments get more and more relevant and the questions become increasingly modern and relatable, maybe the best way to listen to this show is when I ask a question, to pause and think about it a little bit.\n\nBut all that said\u2026even if you own your body\u2026do you have control over it? After all, there are things that we own that we don\u2019t have COMPLETE control over\u2026an 80 year old lady with a sticky gas pedal isn\u2019t entitled to the right to drive her car through a 7-11. And now that we\u2019ve asked all these questions, let me tell you something\u2026listeners of the Philosophize This! program\u2026you are NOT entitled to complete control over your body! I mean, we all know\u2026its common knowledge that 6000 years ago when the lord in his eternal grace put the very first human on planet earth, Adam, he gave him dominion over all of the fish and fowl!\n\nGod said:\n\n\u201cBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\u201d\n\nGod gave this guy Adam a pretty daunting task\u2026he essentially gave him dominion over every living thing that moves on the earth. Well part of all of those living things is\u2026 you. Part of all those living things were Adam\u2019s kids. And let\u2019s not forget the 5th commandment: Honor thy father and mother! We are not born free, we are born as subjects of our father, who we are beholden to. The first and most natural form of government if you are a human being living under the God of the Old Testament in this natural world\u2026is a monarchy. This is the most natural form of government\u2026it is the system of government that God initially laid out\u2026it is the one that we are used to. We are born unfree and we should stay that way.\n\nThis was the basic position of a 17th century political theorist named Sir Robert Filmer\u2026if you couldn\u2019t tell he was a huge supporter of a monarchy:\n\n\u201cThe first government in the world was monarchical in the father of all flesh, Adam being commanded to people and multiply the earth, and to subdue it, and having dominion given him over all creatures, was thereby the monarch of the whole world: none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing, but by his grant or permission, or by succession from him: The earth, saith the Psalmist, hath he given to the children of men, which shew the title comes from fatherhood.\u201d\n\nThis position was known as Patriarchalism. The King or Monarch of a particular government serves the role of the father, and we as people should be subservient to him like his children. Well as we\u2019ve talked about, this time period was filled with all sorts of intellectual battles. The one that was probably the most important in retrospect was this battle of what political system is the most appropriate. One of the guys that was putting his life on the line, constantly running and fighting against monarch rule was John Locke. Now if you live in the United States, or most modern nations for that matter, you are very familiar with the political philosophy of John Locke; it was what the founding fathers used as a framework when building the constitution, along with Montesquieu.\n\nThe important part is that each and every day you wake up and go to your job in the 21st century\u2026you are still feeling the effects of this battle we\u2019re about to talk about fought all the way back in the 1600\u2019s. We think of a battlefield\u2026we have all seen huge explosions before and they are incredibly dramatic and scary, but are few bombs in history that still affect people centuries after they were initially dropped. And this bomb of political theory set off by John Locke who spent most of his life on the run and scared just to be able to\u2026we are living in the shockwave of this bomb.\n\nSo the ideas themselves we are going to be familiar with\u2026and it is easy to just write them off and say \u201cOh, I\u2019ve already heard about that, so I already know about it\u2026i can just tune out\u201d But context is everything\u2026and if we understand how John Locke arrived at these ideas and where shone his lantern of reason to develop this system, it can give us some very nice insights into the modern world we\u2019re living in. When John Locke wrote his two treatises on government, his second one being the huge influence on the founding fathers, he was responding to Sir Robert Filmer and his defense of Patriarchalism. His second treatise on government was a direct counter-attack in this intellectual war zone.\nTo put it lightly, Locke thought that the idea that we were born unfree children under the dominion of a father figure was complete trash. He attacks the argument of Filmer on two different fronts\u2026one: Filmer\u2019s interpretation of God pronouncing Adam the monarch steward over every living thing on planet earth\u2026was a pathetic distortion of reality. Locke says when God said to fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth\u2026if you read the Bible it is glaringly obvious he wasn\u2019t talking to Adam in particular\u2026he was talking to all of mankind! God pronounced the HUMAN SPECIES as stewards over the land, not a single guy named Adam who we are perpetually in service of. Locke argues that after all, the commandment goes \u201cHonor thy father AND mother\u201d There is no Patriarch. And \u201chonoring\u201d your parents is much different than being born a piece of their property.\n\nWell what about the fact that we are born helpless? We need our parents to take care of us or we die\u2026are we really born free if that is the case? Locke says yes, we are. We just aren\u2019t able to exercise it yet. Similar to our ability to reason. As humans we possess an innate faculty of an ability to reason, but as infants we have no way of exercising it yet. Would you say that we are born irrational creatures by nature? Or would you say we are rational creatures without the ability to express it yet?\n\nHe uses this example to make the case for why we obviously are not born unfree:\n\n\u201cThus we are born free, as we are born rational; not that we have actually the exercise of either: age, that brings one, brings with it the other too. And thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to parents may consist together, and are both founded on the same principle.\u201d\n\nThe implications of this are huge. So if we are not born into a world instantly under the control of some other person, then we are in a sense, created equal. We are self-owned machines. So on one end Locke destroys Filmer\u2019s argument by claiming that he drastically misinterpreted the Bible\u2026You were completely wrong in the way that you interpreted this passage but EVEN IF YOU DIDN\u2019T misinterpret the Bible so badly, you were in the wrong from the start because\u2026we shouldn\u2019t look to things like the Bible to determine what system of government we have. The Bible is great for some things, but not for this. Reason, used correctly, is a much better way to arrive at a good system of government.\nLocke talks about how so many of these things from the Bible that theologians claim is divine revelation that reason could never arrive at\u2026he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Uh, he has this really great section where he uses the example we were talking about earlier\u2026that God made a declaration that we, as the human species are hereby kings over all of the animals of the earth and that we should eat them\u2026.John Locke goes, why do you even need God to say that to arrive at that conclusion? I mean, if you believe that God created us, then you believe he created all of the processes in our body, and the fact that we have such a strong desire to live, the fact that we get hungry and want to eat those other creatures of the earth, that alone should show you that eating those animals is a behavior that God endorses.\n\nAnd the significance of this is that you can use reason and our place in the natural world to determine what is correct behavior and you don\u2019t need to worry about misinterpreting some obscure tweet that God sent out thousands of years ago. He is very clear about this he talks about the different ways God COULD have created the world, but didn\u2019t. This world is a deliberate construct of this creator. So, if people like Descartes can measure things in the natural world and find these mathematical constants and try to arrive at a universal system\u2026If we can study substances in the natural world and how they react to each other and arrive at a system of chemistry\u2026if we can study events in the natural world and come up with a system of meteorology\u2026Is it really THAT CRAZY to think that we could study our place within the natural world and come up with a system of ethics? or a political system for that matter?\n\nYou know, people are typically given a system of ethics in modern times. All kinds of examples of this\u2026They\u2019re told that God chose this system of behaviors for them to follow and they better do it, or else. They watch TV and watch how other people treat each other and try to emulate it in their life, so that maybe their life becomes more like this guy on TV and his life. But for a long time thinkers wondered, what do we base our system of ethics on? Just imagine TV and the Bible didn\u2019t exist for a second\u2026where would you start if you were forced to try to build an ethical system? What behaviors would matter to you? Certain things we know we feel\u2026like we hate it when someone steals from us, but what would you use as a basis for making the claim that \u201cstealing is wrong\u201d.\n\nWell lucky for us, we\u2019ve already talked about SEVERAL examples of this. The Epicureans in the Hellenistic age looked at the default human behavior. If you remember they said that from the very moment we are born we seem to avoid pain and seek out pleasure. I mean, if you pinch the skin of the new born baby it pulls it\u2019s hand away out of instinct. From that, they decided that pleasure is the ultimate good and from there it\u2019s just a matter of truly knowing what brings you pleasure in the long term as opposed to what you just THINK brings you pleasure. Again, they asked what does it mean to be a human living in this natural world, an aversion to pain, let\u2019s develop an ethical system around it.\nBut this is just one example of MANY. Back in the seventeenth century, there were several thinkers including Thomas Hobbes who we\u2019ve already talked about and John Locke who thought that by using reason to analyze human nature and our place in the natural world, certain universal truths can be deduced from it. This system is what is known as Natural Law. Now, the rest of the episode will focus on what this natural law is, but lets put this umbrella of justification over all of the rest of this: Just like a law can exist on the books in today\u2019s world, and it doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest if the police aren\u2019t enforcing it\u2026this system of natural law can exist and it means absolutely nothing if there is no one there to enforce it.\n\n\u201cPOLITICAL POWER, then, I take to be a RIGHT of making laws with penalties of death, and consequently all less penalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of employing the force of the community, in the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign injury; and all this only for the public good.\u201d\n\nWhen put the most broadly\u2026this is the role of government to John Locke: to preserve the rights afforded to us by natural law\u2026all of them. This is much different than the other political theorist we talked about: Thomas Hobbes. Remember Hobbes thought the role of government was to maintain stability\u2026to prevent chaos\u2026and as individuals we didn\u2019t have any unalienable rights, just a will to survive. Many of the rights that we DID have in a state of nature were handed over to the Leviathan in the interest of self-preservation. The government\u2019s job to John Locke is to protect our natural rights. Now, the important part for us is\u2026what are those rights? Put the most broadly, Life, Liberty and Property. You ever wonder why those rights are touted as being so unalienable? It\u2019s because the foundation of them is based on what is seen as a universal truth derived from nature.\n\nSo we started out the show today by asking who owns your body. Who owns you? Now I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that most of us said that we feel as though we are self-owned. We own ourselves and with it a sense of Autonomy. Autonomy is referring to our ability to make decisions for ourselves, not coerced by some other individual or group. So we have the life we were given, the liberty to control that life\u2026but John Locke things we are entitled to one more thing. Property.\n\nNow, he isn\u2019t saying that you are entitled to a house when you are born, or to a yacht when you\u2019re 16 years old. When you use your life to exercise your liberty to provide for yourself, and you labor hard and create something that improves your lot in life, John Locke thinks you are entitled to the fruits of your labor. Now this is an interesting point, one that has caused a lot of backlash over the years. Living in a modern, capitalistic society modeled after the philosophy of John Locke, we might not THINK about it\u2026but why are you necessarily entitled to what you create? Why is that YOURS now?\nMaybe the best way to understand why John Locke feels this way is to consider the alternatives. I mean, look around you\u2026everything you own\u2026everything you consider to be the fruits of your labor was at one point a natural resource harvested from the earth in some way. Books are made out of paper which comes from trees\u2026your cellphone is made from the tears of some factory worker in a third world country. We live in a world where using that natural right of liberty when trying to provide for ourselves forces us to use the natural resources of the world. We have no choice\u2026if we don\u2019t want to starve to death, we need to use what is around us to survive. Just because you look around you and none of this stuff LOOKS like it came from nature\u2026none of this stuff just magically appeared. It is some natural resource doctored and processed down to provide some purpose.\n\nSo if we\u2019re FORCED to use the resources of the world\u2026it begs the question.. who owns those resources? I mean, what good is your life and liberty if you were born into a world where there are no resources to use. The more relevant question is not who OWNS these resources, but who controls them. Well there are actually a lot of possible answers to this question\u2026and it is fun to brainstorm and try to think of a method that we could use that would be fair to everyone and allows some level of control over them. But for the sake of this show, let\u2019s just talk about a few of the common ideas.\n\nSo one possibility is that we assign a group of people to be the overseers of the resources. As difficult or impractical as it sounds, they would essentially catalog all of the resources that people could provide for themselves with\u2026all of the trees, the rocks, the sand, the dirt, coal-mines, gold mines EVERYTHING. and then they would be assigned the task to perfectly and equally distribute one part to each and every person. That way, nobody goes without the tools they need to be able to exercise their liberty to provide for themselves.\n\nThe common argument against this one is that it is horrendously ineffective in practice. You could find 100 reasons\u2026but how bout that all men are created equal\u2026but not all natural resources are created equal. There\u2019s going to be some people that just get a field full of dirt and trash and other people that get a mine full of gold and silver. Even if it COULD be implemented in real life, let\u2019s not forget about the idea that in this model we are handing over complete control over the resources of the world to a small handful of people. We\u2019ve seen how that pans out.\n\nAnother common recommendation of dealing with this resource problem is: why does there even need to be a controller at all? Why can\u2019t we all just take whatever we want, whenever we want when we need it? Well, aside from the environmental catastrophes that could occur if we allowed for the unrestricted extraction of whatever resource you want whenever you want it, the biggest attack on this method of managing it is that it just isn\u2019t consistent with human nature and reality. People that think this way usually are really compassionate, farsighted people that are content with what they have. The problem is, Hitler didn\u2019t invade Czechoslovakia because of scarcity. He didn\u2019t continue into Poland and France because his people were incapable of surviving on what resources they had. His goal was conquest and glory.\n\nLets not project how WE would act in a given situation onto the totality of the human race. There are selfish, greedy, bad people in the world. I mean, even with an over-crowded prison population there are enough people willing to infringe upon your property that you have a car alarm. You have locks on your doors. People willing to do terrible things in the name of their own self interests exist, whether we like that reality or not. Making every resource on earth uncontrolled doesn\u2019t force people to go along with the system. And it also doesn\u2019t give your neighbor much of an incentive to remain productive if he can just come over and use your pots and pans whenever he wants because technically they aren\u2019t yours. This issue of productivity is a big one to people of Locke\u2019s time\u2026we need to keep these resources productive. We don\u2019t want somebody hoarding a bunch of resources and doing nothing with them\u2026saving them for a rainy day. This is the basis for a lot of modern advocates of taxing private property. This is usually aligned with the democrat party nowadays where if you own a piece of land, you pay tax on that piece of land on a regular basis and the thinking is that by having to pay that amount you will be forced to try to use that piece of land to make money and pay those taxes, as opposed to you being able to just own it and do whatever you want with it, if you want to have your land be a vacant lot, that\u2019s your right! Tough issue with tons of debate and it stems from this question.\nAnyway, Locke proposes a different solution to the problem. His idea is that we have the natural right to our life and liberty to move around as we please and work to provide for ourselves\u2026his idea was that you have a natural right to the fruits of your labor. The thinking was that this motivates people to work hard if they want a lot of stuff and allows for people that just want to get by, to just get by. It doesn\u2019t put complete control over how productive the resources are being in the hands of a small group of people\u2026in fact if somebody wants to put the resources to use, they can. The only thing stopping them is their will, to get up and do the work.\n\nA later political theorist named Claude Frederic Bastiat summed the next part of this up really well he said:\n\n\u201cLife, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.\u201d\nSo here\u2019s what Locke and Bastiat are getting at. We now have a basis for why\u2026 just by virtue of being born, to John Locke, we are entitled to three things: Life, Liberty and the fruits of our labor\u2026 however hard we choose to work, that\u2019s what we get. But if these are natural rights afforded to use by using reason to look at our place within nature, then like we talked about before, that natural law is pointless if there isn\u2019t a police officer to enforce the law.\n\nThere are bad people out there\u2026people that would take the fruits of your labor in a heartbeat if there was nothing protecting you. And you can say, well I got somthin fer those boys. I got me some fire arms. Dem boys be plum stupider than a jackrabbit they come takin my fruits of labor.\nWell what if these bad people start a gang and group together. You can handle a few of them with your defensive advantage\u2026but can you take a 30-40 person gang by yourself? What if they\u2019re highly trained because this is how they get everything. Could you single handedly defeat ISIS? Really, the only solution to this problem is to be protected by a more highly-trained, well-equipped gang of people to protect your natural rights: your life, your liberty to not be handcuffed to a drain pipe somewhere and your property. The fruits of your labor and the manifestation of your liberty to provide for yourself.\n\nThis is why government exists to John Locke. To protect your natural rights of Life, Liberty and Property. You know early in his life, John Locke was actually an advocate of a Monarchy, but you read his works as his life progresses and he gets more and more radical in this direction that we\u2019ve been talking about. And make no mistake, these were radical ideas at the time. We\u2019re going to talk a lot about his life on the run from these people next episode, but rest assured in knowing that he was running for a reason. This gradual movement throughout his entire life came to a head near the end of his life when he advocated a position that at his time what downright revolutionary. See, Thomas Hobbes said that we are in a state of nature where we don\u2019t have any restrictions, but we don\u2019t have \u201cunalienable rights\u201d so to speak. Someone can kill you in the state of nature and it can\u2019t really be considered \u201cwrong\u201d because there is no system of laws in place that deems it bad. The ultimate goal is survival\u2026you can do anything you want if it means you are going to survive. Like we talked about you can steal all your neighbors stuff and this isn\u2019t wrong in the state of nature. Hobbes says that we forfeit most of the rights that we have in the state of nature to the Sovereign whose sole just is to maintain order. John Locke on the other hand says that the role of government is to protect the natural rights of it\u2019s citizens\u2026so this makes him conclude that if the government is NOT serving the people as it should, that the citizens underneath it have every right to change it to something else..or even overthrow it completely.\nFind out what happens on the next episode of Philosophize This! I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\n\nOn this episode of the podcast, we begin learning about John Locke. First, we ask ourselves whether or not we own our bodies and what other things we are entitled to simply by virtue of being born. Next, we consider whether its possible to develop a system of ethics by studying the world around us, just as we develop systems of science and mathematics. Finally, we discuss the three unalienable rights Locke believes humans have (they\u2019ll sound a bit familiar!), and why he thinks its the government\u2019s job to uphold those rights. All this and more on the latest episode of Philosophize This!\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_31": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 36 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #036 on John Locke pt. 2. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nWhen most people think back to the most revolutionary moments in history, when they think about the moments when things changed the most\u2026they\u2019re usually thinking of pictures of war and destruction, you know\u2026images of soldiers goose stepping down the streets of a town they just conquered. When most people think about conquering entire populations of people or overthrowing kingdoms, they see images of Ghengis Khan siening Baghdad, they think about great Caliphates from over the centuries. But just think about the power of ideas.\n\nHow many kingdoms over the years were brought to their knees simply because of ideas? Ideas that were planted in the heads of their population and made into a reality? It\u2019s very easy to think of the most critical shifts in history as being connected to one of these bloody conflicts\u2026but Ghengis Khan could never dream of overthrowing as many kingdoms as the ideas of John Locke. But this is far from a secret. In fact, the Monarchies KNEW how powerful these radical ideas could be. And just like any organism that is built for survival, these monarchies were fighting for their lives.\n\nJohn Locke was born in 1632 and went to school at the Westminster School in London before he went on to attend Oxford. One of the most interesting things about John Locke is just how much his thoughts transformed over the course of his life. I mean, you read some of his writing from when he was younger, like when he went to Oxford and it is almost indistinguishable from stuff that you could read from late in his life. Like I said last time, when John Locke is in his early twenties, he is actually a huge proponent of a Monarchy\u2026and it\u2019s not until AFTER his formal education when he continues talking to influential people about the role of government that he arrives at his ideas that would change the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s impressive to me is that he didn\u2019t need to do any of this. I feel like something happens with most people right around the time they graduate high school or college where, there\u2019s this feeling that they\u2019ve already gone through their education and now they got the world pretty much figured out. Like, as babies, we come into the world with nothing. I mean, you just look into the eyes of a baby and you can see that it is soaking everything up around it. You know\u2026the common thing that people say is that the brain of a baby is like sponge. They\u2019re CONSTANTLY learning about the world around them. And then they have their first day of school and they go to first grade and then second grade and the learn more about being a human. Then they graduate high school and if they\u2019re lucky they get to go to college and learn some more and then something happens with most people. Learning, isn\u2019t as much of a priority to them. They\u2019ve gleaned this lens that they view the world through, their life is going well and they feel like they pretty much have it all figured out. Life becomes about using what you\u2019ve already learned as opposed to remaining a student of the game.\n\nAnd it\u2019s funny because if you asked 99% of these people, do you think you know everything do you think you got it all figured out? They would say, of course not. They realize it should be a priority to learn\u2026but there\u2019s a difference between common knowledge and common practice. And John Locke was someone that never stopped learning and adapting. But just imagine if he did! Just imagine if John Locke grew complacent with his political thoughts\u2026imagine if he still thought the same politically as he did in college. Where would the world be today? It\u2019s kind of inspiring\u2026one of you people out there listening to this that love to think and remain a student of the world\u2026one of you guys or gals might come up with an idea like John Locke\u2019s.\n\nMaybe another interesting element of John Locke is that his decisions to continue learning really complicated his life a lot. These monarchies were like giant octopi with slimy tentacles, they were these organisms feeling around for anything trying to threaten their existence\u2026and when they located one, they just SLURP wrapped around it and held on and wouldn\u2019t let it go until it stopped moving. To understand the feat John Locke must have felt we kinda gotta put ourselves in his shoes, so let\u2019s talk about what he would\u2019ve expected to be done to him if he was caught daring to oppose the monarchy.\n\nIn the 1680\u2019s there was a conspiracy and attempt by a couple different groups to overthrow King James II who was the monarch of England at the time\u2026this whole situation came to a climax at what is now known as the Battle of Sedgemoor when the rebellion got absolutely demolished by James II\u2019s army and after words they imprisoned over 1000 of these rebels to stand trial for questioning the crown. This is how serious it was\u2026just the RETALIATION from the monarchy has a name in the annals of history. The methods they used to show people what would happen if you dare cross the monarchy are remembered by their own title. The trials of these rebels would eventually become known as the Bloody Assizes.\n\nThey sentenced an elderly woman to be burned at the stake\u2026but don\u2019t worry\u2026they downgraded her sentence to a mere public beheading. Several hundred of them were forcefully taken to the West Indies and enslaved but most of them died of Typhus along the way. But the most powerful message that was sent during this particular fiasco was when they took around 150 of these lucky rebels\u2026they were hung, drawn and quartered\u2026and then pieces of their bodies were hung around the entire kingdom to serve as a constant, bloody reminder to anyone thinking of causing trouble of what happens when you act out against the king. I mean, just put yourself in the shoes of the average person\u2026how terrifying would it have been to have these bodies hung around everywhere? You definitely wouldn\u2019t want to question the people in charge, no matter how unjust things may seem. There are accounts from people living at the time that even the great-grandchildren of these people who witnessed it\u2026even 150 years later people still wouldn\u2019t go around where they hung these bodies.\n\nWhats the importance of all this when understanding John Locke? There is something to be said for the sort of hardship he had to endure throughout his life just to hold these radical opinions. I mean\u2026in today\u2019s world you can hold radical opinions and it doesn\u2019t really need to affect your life that much. There are tons of people that hold radical positions\u2026you know they\u2019ll say that reptilian shape shifters are the puppet masters of our planet and that they\u2019ve infiltrated all the top governments of the world and they are directing our species the way they want it to be\u2026That\u2019s some pretty radical stuff, but all they gotta do is start a YouTube channel. John Locke put everything on the line.\n\nImagine holding a position that forced you into exile. Imagine being forced to move away from your home. John Locke not only had to move to Amsterdam, but he had to live and work under a false name so that no one could find him. Once the English government knew about how dangerous his thoughts were\u2026the kept him under constant surveillance\u2026spies following him around asking people about him trying to catch him doing something wrong. There are letters you can read from John Locke where it looks like he is writing a letter that is completely benign about childcare, but in reality he was writing in code plotting strategy for a revolution. You know, the kid represents the revolution and the bad nanny that he refers to represents the King of England\u2026the whole thing was in code.\n\nNow if I caught you on the street, if I asked you the question who were the three continental rationalists\u2026how many of you would know? I hope everybody: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz\u2026well the thinkers they were competing against were Locke, Berkeley and Hume, the first one of those three being John Locke. Locke is known as a British empiricist.\n\nSo, if we have these two groups that are in competition with each other and the differences in their views are what separates them from each other, then that kind of implies that at least some of the time there are issues that these two groups hold opposite opinions on. And that\u2019s true, though it should be said that the true relationship between the two groups isn\u2019t as cut and dry as it might initially seem, but historians of philosophy like separating them into these two groups cause it keeps things nice and organized.\n\nThat said, if we were looking for one of these issues that the two groups fundamentally disagreed on, one pretty good place to start would be the question of: What is the contents of our brain the moment we are born? Are we born with a personality and certain curiosities and interests? Are we born with certain innate pieces of knowledge? And when you think about this question enough it eventually turns into the common modern day discussion of Nature vs Nurture.\n\nSo it might help before we begin talking about this for us each to think about what our views on the subject are. The two ways that people typically think about this question in modern times are: well there is one type of person that thinks that we are born\u2026empty. Our cells communicate with each other to make things happen at a biological level, but our brains are computers that are sitting on the DOS screen\u2026with that blinking white line just waiting for us to put stuff in. There\u2019s nothing on the hard drive, just drivers in place poised ready to help the brain process the information coming in into something that is useful to it. The thinking behind this is that we are evolutionary beings that needed to be able to survive in DRASTICALLY different climates throughout history. I mean just think about it. There are tribes of humans that have survived and lived in the Amazon Jungle with all sorts of threats to their survival with Jaguars and Snakes all around them\u2026and at the exact same time that that was happening, there are humans living in Siberia where they have to adapt to a -30 temperature everyday. Now consider the fact that while both of THOSE things are going on\u2026humans are ALSO having to adapt to living in New York City. The software that was programmed into our heads has one goal: survival. That software doesn\u2019t know what sort of climate or living conditions or culture we\u2019re going to be born into, so one group of people today think that we are born with almost nothing in the nurture department, and that from the very moment we are born we start soaking in all of this information and learning how to survive in THIS PARTICULAR environment.\n\nBy the way, this idea also is present in the womb. There are studies of babies who were in their mother\u2019s belly during WW2 during the siege of Leningrad. Leningrad is this Russian city that was surrounded and the people inside had no way of getting food or supplies, so they essentially just sat around starving for months. There are studies on the kids that were in the womb during that period of time and they have all sorts of different features that they picked up from that conditioning\u2026Some of them metabolize calories ultra-efficiently, some of them have serious health defects.\n\nSo this represents ONE side of the modern day argument, the other side has a little more variance to it. On one hand we have people like Descartes who just say that humans are born with little bits of innate knowledge\u2026for example he said we are born with an innate understanding of God as being an infinite being and he went on to use this as part of his proof of Gods existence. But then there are people that go even further. The person who probably went the furthest in this field is someone we\u2019ve already talked about: Plato. If any of you guys remember the Plato episode, well you are probably a genius. It was a long time ago. Go out and buy yourselves some fro-yo as a reward. But I\u2019d imagine most of you have a faint recollection of what we talked about: Plato believed in the idea of innate knowledge. More specifically, that total knowledge of everything in the universe is inside of us, but because we die and our souls enter new bodies, we forget all of it when we are born. Plato thought the process of learning, wasn\u2019t the process of building connections in someone\u2019s head\u2026connecting one schema to another\u2026learning was the process of remembering this total knowledge bit by bit.\n\nAnd if you remember he tells that great story with Socrates in it teaching the slave boy how to do geometry. Slavery, reincarnation\u2026everybody was having a great time back then. But the important part to take from this is that rationalists throughout the years since Plato and during the time of John Locke, said that we ARE born with certain innate ideas that allow us to arrive at further knowledge through the use of reason alone. Just as an artist paints a painting and leaves a little signature at the bottom\u2026you know\u2026makes his mark in his work\u2026rationalists believed that we, being created by something that they called God, had a little mark on each of us\u2026and that mark came in the form of innate knowledge at birth. These innate ideas, coupled with our ability to reason can at least in theory lead us to certain knowledge about the world around us.\n\nLocke, and the British Empiricists\u2026didn\u2019t exactly agree with that. When John Locke was at Oxford he met a guy named Robert Boyle. Robert Boyle we would know today as one of the godfathers of modern chemistry, but to John Locke he was just an interesting dude. What Boyle told Locke about the makeup of the world around us would shape the way Locke viewed how we gather knowledge for the rest of his life. Boyle told him that the world is made up of tiny, little subatomic things known as corpuscles. Now this worldview shaped the way that he viewed the world in MANY areas, but the important thing is that John Locke doesn\u2019t know why there is any intelligible reason to even entertain the idea that we are born with any sort of knowledge at birth. Where is the evidence for this?\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026he attacks the notion and wonders how anyone can actually believe this. He says that these people say we have innate ideas at birth, but in order for something to be an idea\u2026it has to be present in someone\u2019s mind. That\u2019s kind of the DEFINITION of an idea. But if that\u2019s true, and these ideas are ACUTALLY innate and not just something that SEEMS innate\u2026how is it possible that these ideas are present before the infants are even born? There is a big difference between something feeling intuitive and us just not knowing or remembering where we received that intuition\u2026and something magically being present in something before that thing even exists.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cit seems to me near a contradiction to say, that there are truths imprinted on the soul which it perceives or understands not; imprinting, if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making certain truths to be perceived. For to imprint anything on the mind without the mind\u2019s perceiving it, seems to me hardly intelligible. If therefore children and idiots have souls, have minds, with those impressions upon them, they must unavoidably perceive them, and necessarily know and assent to these truths; Which, since they do not, it is evident that there are no such impressions.\u201d\n\nJohn Locke goes on to use critical thinking. He wonders\u2026if human beings truly have ideas that are innate\u2026concepts already loaded into the hard drive at birth\u2026what sort of effects would that have on the world? He makes the argument\u2026look, if we really had a collection of ideas that were innate to all human beings, regardless of where they were born or who their parents were, then it stands to reason that we would see at least SOME similarities across ALL cultures in the world throughout all of history, right? John Locke points out that we DONT see those similarities, especially when it comes to the notion of God who, if the rationalist position was true, would be the guy leaving his signature at the bottom of the painting.\n\nSo in the argument of Nature vs Nurture\u2026it is safe to say that John Locke falls strongly on the side of Nurture. He writes here one of his most famous passages:\n\n\u201cLet us then suppose the Mind to be, as we say, white Paper, void of all Characters, without any Ideas; How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless Fancy of Man has painted on it, with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of Reason and Knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, From Experience: In that, all our Knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives it self.\u201d\n\nJohn Locke believes that the human mind at birth is a Tabula Rasa. or blank tablet\u2026or blank slate. whatever you want to call it. We\u2019re born with no knowledge of the outside world, or of the self, or of God or anything for that matter. The processes of reason and abstraction are innate\u2026the method the mind uses to PROCESS input is innate\u2026but the IDEAS that that mind is processing comes from the outside world. Back to our computer analogy. The hardware and drivers are innate, but they are useless without a hard drive and information for them to process. John Locke says that that information comes from experience\u2026sense perceptions from the outside world.\n\nYou know\u2026if there was a contest where someone asked me to think of a way to bore thousands of people and get them to shut off a podcast, I would probably start explaining a 17th century version of how the brain processes information. And as interesting as it is to me, it\u2019s understandable. I mean, who cares? Oh that\u2019s cute he thought your brain was made out of cheese. But just real quick, I want to describe a small piece of the process because it has huge implications. So Locke thinks that there are multiple different types of ideas and multiple different steps to get to them, respectively. The critical first step to arriving any sort of idea is stimulation of our sense organs\u2026either through seeing something\u2026hearing something\u2026etc. We take this very raw perception and the mind processes it and produces what Locke calls simple ideas. An example of a simple idea is that that lawnmower outside is very loud and is ruining the podcast. Then those simple ideas become the ingredients that we have\u2026and the brain processes them and reasons and makes connections between them, arriving at complex ideas.\n\nNow the awesome part about this is that Locke concedes to the point that reason is a very important part of arriving at ideas, but his OVERALL point is that ALL of it would be IMPOSSIBLE, the mind would have nothing to use it\u2019s reason to process if it wasn\u2019t for that first crucial step\u2026the senses perceiving something.\n\nSo John Locke thinks that the mind is a blank slate at birth and that who we are and the ideas that we possess come from the sum total of all the experiences we\u2019ve had since birth. Now, if you believe something like that, then you also must believe that really annoying person at work is just the sum total of a set of experiences that might not be as reasonable as yours. And if you believe that, then how about considering how this should affect this giant institution that we\u2019ve constructed as a society that you pay lots of tax dollars into that cultivates experiences for people. I\u2019m talking about the public school system.\n\nJohn Locke, being someone who believes we are shaped by our experiences, its no surprise he had a LOT of thoughts about education and how crucial it is for people.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201ci think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education\u2026\u201d\n\nHe thinks that 9 parts out of 10 of what makes someone who they are is derived from the nature of their education. He has all sorts of really interesting ideas that were incredible revolutionary for his time period\u2026.they\u2019re still weird for OUR time period\u2026ideas to improve the education of the people we are creating.\n\nSo if John Locke was the Superintendent of your school when you were a kid, he has all sorts of seemingly bizarre things to add to the everyday curriculum\u2026but he has a good reason for all of them. One of the first things he thinks we should teach people as soon as they are able to walk? Dancing.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about channeling your inner spirit \u2026this may seem a little crazy at first but his reasoning is far from it. He says that when you dance\u2026you have to stand up straight, keep good posture, and move in a directed manner, accurately and with purpose. Locke thought that if you teach kids to move and stand and act in this manner, that they would naturally be able to bring those skills over to their personal life. They would stand up straight and do things with purpose. Now maybe you disagree with him on this one point, but one great point he is raising is endorsing activities that build skills that aren\u2019t necessarily on the surface of the lesson.\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve heard TONS of people talk about how the biggest lessons they learned from high school they learned in organized sports. The teamwork, the discipline, the comradery, the long-term gratification, the feeling of doing something small that sets the stage for someone else to step in and make something huge happen\u2026these are all lessons that kids take from these sports programs when on the surface, they just appear to be playing basketball. Locke talks about several of these different skills to teach that have benefits beyond the obvious\u2026he advocates teaching French to young people because it will allow them to have more opportunities in business later on in life and allow them to understand French politics which would turn them into better voters for England. But my favorite insight that Locke gives into his vision of proper education is this:\n\n\u201cgreat care is to be taken, that it be never made as a business to him, nor he look on it as a task. We naturally, as I said, even from our cradles, love liberty, and have therefore an aversion to many things for no other reason but because they are enjoin\u2019d us. I have always had a fancy that learning might be made a play and recreation to children: and that they might be brought to desire to be taught, if it were proposed to them as a thing of honour, credit, delight, and recreation, or as a reward for doing something else; and if they were never chid or corrected for the neglect of it. \u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is that the task of education is incredibly important when it comes to creating the type of people we want to. Yet, more often than not education is crammed down these kids\u2019 throats. They are FORCED to learn about stuff they don\u2019t care about. Locke says, look its not that they don\u2019t WANT to learn. We have a natural predisposition to learn stuff from birth\u2026the difference is we learn about stuff we are interested in. Let\u2019s not make education boring\u2026a much more effective way of doing it is to make it entertaining or fun or honorable. When we force feed people stuff they aren\u2019t interested in, they don\u2019t learn very well\u2026funny how that works. Thank you for listening\u2026ill talk to you guys soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_32": {"date": "2014-10-2", "text": "Posted on October 2, 2014\nEpisode 37 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #037 on Gottfried Leibniz pt. 1 \u2013 A Million Points of Light. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nThe central theme\u2026the pivot point from which the three continental rationalists began their philosophy\u2026was the question of substance. We\u2019ve talked about it a couple times before. Descartes defined substance as that which its existence explains itself and from this he arrives at the conclusion that the universe has three substances: Mind, Matter and God. Spinoza then picks up where Descartes left off and disagrees with him he says no, there is only ONE true substance, and that is EVERYTHING THAT IS. God, nature, this totality that we are all a part of\u2026that is the only that that\u2019s existence explains itself. Leibniz takes a different approach though he can be seen as similar to them in some ways\u2026Leibniz says that there is only one true substance, but that one substance was something called a Monad which everything is made up of.\n\nNow just for a second think of how different he is from Spinoza. I mean, Spinoza thinks that there is one substance\u2026and that one substance is EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE. Leibniz goes the other direction\u2026one substance that is so small it can\u2019t even be said to exist in physical form. Let me explain that for a second by talking about the problem that these people were trying to solve.\nLet\u2019s take the iPhone example from a little earlier. Let\u2019s say you have an iPhone and you want to dissect it and know everything there is to know about it. Where would you start? Can you know everything about it by just looking at it? By just rubbing your fingers all over it? Do you understand the essence of that iPhone by just playing Angry Birds on it? Of course not. You break it open and see all this green stuff and all these transistors\u2026do you understand all there is to understand about that iPhone simply by looking inside of it? No, but you are getting closer\u2026right? I mean, you\u2019re taking something incredibly complex and you\u2019re starting to break it down into smaller pieces and understand the function of each one of those pieces. Maybe through enough observation you find out that this little green chip controls the camera and that this little green chip over here controls the headphone jack.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t understand the nature of the iPhone do we? I mean, where did all this green stuff come from? Don\u2019t we need to understand all that stuff before we can truly say we know what an iPhone is? I mean, isn\u2019t the fact that these materials were mined out of a cave somewhere or coalesced together out of dirt\u2026isn\u2019t that an important element of what an iPhone is? Well, just how we are taking this incredibly complex thing and breaking it down into simpler and simpler parts to try to understand it better, this is the same tactic philosophers used when trying to glean an understanding of our place in the natural world. I mean, if you think an iPhone is difficult to break down and understand\u2026these guys had to do it with the universe.\n\nAnd look, we do this ALL THE TIME in modern times and don\u2019t even realize it because we\u2019ve been doing it every day of our lives. We look at the sky and we see what\u2026what is the sky\u2026air, clouds and sunshine\u2026right? But what sort of grasp do we have on the sky? Now if you said that and someone asked you to explain it better, you might say\u2026well it\u2019s made up of oxygen molecules and nitrogen molecules and hydrogen and carbon and not many people would argue with the fact that you are doing a better job of describing the sky than just saying its a bunch of clouds, air and exhaust from pick up trucks.\n\nWhen something is complex, to understand it fully, one really promising method is to break it down into the simplest parts possible because typically this gives us some insight into how the more complex things work. This is why substance is so important to this philosophers. What is some thing that we can look at as a starting point. What material or what thing is so simple that it can be understood on its own without having to refer to something else.\n\nWell people have been talking about this since the ancient Greeks! Some of you will remember Zeno\u2019s famous paradox of Achilles running the race and how he can never actually reach the finish line because before he gets there he will have to had run halfway there first. So even when he gets to the very end of the race\u2026he will just stand by the finish line, in theory, having to go halfway to the end and halfway to the end and so on into infinity! The important question here is\u2026can things be infinitely divisible? Can you cut a piece of paper in half a billion times, if you had the proper microscope, tools and the steady hand of Hawkeye Pierce? Could you cut it in half into infinity?\nNow in philosophy we would say that as long as something possesses the quality of extension, or it takes up space in the physical world, Descartes defined it a little further, but for the sake of right now, if something takes up space in any regard, no matter HOW SMALL IT IS, it has some sort of length, breadth and depth. Now if something has length, breadth and depth, that length can be bisected. The depth can be bisected. And to Leibniz, if something can be cut down into increasingly smaller and therefore simpler pieces, then that original thing you are cutting in half CANNOT BE THE MOST SIMPLE THING THERE IS. It cannot be substance, a thing that\u2019s existence explains itself, because the fact that you can cut it in half proves that it has AT LEAST two parts that interact with each other and need each other for the original thing to exist.\n\nThis is why the Monad of Leibniz is nothing like the atom of the ancient Greeks or the atom of today\u2019s world. The atom is a particle\u2026it takes up space in the physical world\u2026it possesses the quality of extension. The Monad is a spiritual entity. Some translations call each Monad a soul. But each Monad is not what you think a soul is if you get your idea of a soul from the movies. When George Bush accepted his parties nomination for president\u2026H.W\u2026president senior\u2026back in 1988 he referred to the people and vision of America as a thousand points of light. Well I kind of plagiarize him and when I picture the vision of Leibniz I think of a million points of light. Sometimes I say ten-thousand if I am a little less sanctimonious that day\u2026but in reality we are talking about a vision of the universe of a near infinite number of these souls\u2026these non-physical, metaphysical points of light that all seem to work together but none actually interact with each other.\n\nMaybe I am sacrificing too much to give that visual of the points of light that are all interconnected\u2026because in reality these Monads are nothing like light at all. They are entirely non-physical so think of one Monad as one unit that makes up everything. One unit of existence\u2026or one unit of reality. Now for anyone that knows the whole story\u2026there are a lot of holes to fill in here for us to completely understand what a Monad is and how it explains phenomena in the natural world. We\u2019re going to spend the rest of our time here today filling in those gaps\u2026but first I want to talk about something that I know at least a few of you are thinking right now\u2026who cares about this stuff at all? What does any of this have to do with anything?\n\nI mean this is similar to last week when you talked about John Locke and his 17th century theory of how the senses perceive knowledge\u2026that ended up completely wrong and is essentially filibustering my life\u2026forcing me to spend my time listening to a failed hypothesis. Why do you do this to me Stephen West.\n\nWell, you\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong in different ways. Yes, ultimately Leibniz and his theory of Monads is widely denounced by science today\u2026although it should be said that they haven\u2019t really refuted it..in the same way they haven\u2019t refuted that the Easter bunny exists. I mean really they could discover than under the fabric of reality that we think exists right now there is a non-physical realm like this that dictates the physical world, but let\u2019s go out on a limb and say that his theory is complete garbage\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean that every detail I tell you about these Monads is completely useless. Make no mistake\u2026there ARE a lot of things I could tell you about his theory of monads that would be a waste of your time\u2026I could talk about it for three hours all the ins and outs of his vision. But certain things about these Monads, when viewed in the full context of his metaphysical system, have deep implications in philosophy.\n\nSo let\u2019s not wax on about the minutiae\u2026let\u2019s talk about these little Monads and what they are exactly. Maybe the best place to start is that all Monads are not created equal. In fact, they vary considerably from one Monad to another. He talks about just how there are no two beings that are perfectly alike\u2026there are no two Monads that are perfectly alike\u2026after all that\u2019s how we perceive things at all, by spotting differences between things. Leibniz points out that because of these differences these Monads can be arranged in terms of a hierarchy. There is a hierarchy of Monads. Some are more important than others, some Monads have more abilities than other Monads\u2026and this hierarchy can be broken down into a simple three tiered system: created monads, monads with perception or memory and monads resembling what we would know as a rational soul. The human mind is a Monad that has a body that corresponds with it. But as complex beings that can be broken down into simpler parts, like the iPhone we were talking about before, we are the sum total of the endless number of monads that make us up and the script that is programmed inside of them. Now this can be kind of difficult to get a hold of\u2026but the vision that he describes of the true nature of the universe\u2026it begins to sound very fractal..much like what SEEMS to be the case in modern physics.\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201ceach portion of matter can be conceived as like a garden full of plants, or like a pond full of fish. But each branch of a plant, each organ of an animal, each drop of its bodily fluids is also a similar garden or a similar pond\u201d\n\nLeibniz famously talks about these Monads as not having any windows\u2026meaning that nothing can come in or go out of these monads. This may be the most important part: These Monads already contain everything that they are using\u2026There is no direct interaction between these monads. There is no, what philosophers would call secondary causation where a monad runs into another monad and something happens or it senses something around it and adapts to it. Just think of how beautiful this concept is:\n\nEach and every thing in the universe has a certain distinctness about it\u2026as an aspect of the universe\u2026it has a certain completely unique concept that it is\u2026and inside of itself\u2026it contains everything that it ever has been, is now or will be at any point in the future. These monads have in them, programmed by God, to Leibniz, a Broadway script. Every beat that they\u2019re going to hit for the duration of the universe. Tomorrow you\u2019re going to be at stage right, dancing around singing Oklahoma! The next day you\u2019re going to be dressed up in a Flamingo costume. But think of this sort of rudimentary script applied to the most fundamental of substances and the sort of assignments they would get.\n\nNow bear with me and think of the implications of this. Let\u2019s say you were one of these spiritual monads\u2026if you are given a Broadway script\u2026part of knowing where on stage you need to be and what lines you need to read and everything like that is knowing where you are going to be in relation to everything else that is going to be onstage. The last thing you want to do in your Flamingo costume is trip over somebody else and face plant off the stage. So even though these monads don\u2019t directly interact with each other, they don\u2019t need to. By knowing their place in this giant cosmic Broadway script, they know exactly where all the other monads are going to be. Each and every monad at each and every point in time understands it\u2019s relationship to everything else in the universe.\n\nThe point of all this is that God, to Leibniz, by writing into these monads a complete script of the past, present and future of the universe created the universe in a state of pre-established harmony.\n\u201cif we could understand the order of the universe well enough, we would find that it surpasses all the wishes of the wisest people, and that it is impossible to make it better than it is \u2014 not merely in respect of the whole in general, but also in respect of ourselves in particular\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve probably all heard the famous quote attributed to Leibniz where he says that we are living in the best of all possible worlds. There\u2019s another quote I forget who it\u2019s by but it goes that Optimists believe we are living in the best of all possible worlds\u2026Pessimists believe it may be true.\n\nNow God\u2019s pre-established harmony, the best of all possible worlds\u2026what this means about free-will and determinism and the problem of evil\u2026this is all going to be ironed out on next week\u2019s episode, and if the concept of these Monads is still a little confusing, don\u2019t worry about it\u2026these abstract systems can be kind of hard to fully understand when there aren\u2019t any examples of things that happen in the real world as a result of them. Next week, we\u2019re going to have plenty of them. But right now I want to talk about what this interconnectedness of the universe and this pre-programmed script of the past, present and future has to do with the way we arrive at knowledge as humans.\n\nBecause the human mind is a monad\u2026and because every monad has in it a complete explanation of itself and how that relates to everything else in the universe\u2026Leibniz believes that at least, in theory, we can use reason to analyze the relationships between all of these aspects of the universe and arrive at a complete and total web of knowledge.\n\nTo use a very crude example, because when it comes to the universe we are talking about many more moving parts\u2026but if you could understand exactly how you related to the concept of cancer\u2026and you could understand how it was connected to every other monad in existence\u2026then you would have a lot of information about it\u2026you would be able to determine it\u2019s cause and ultimately how to destroy it. But practically speaking, even to Leibniz, this is virtually impossible. I mean just think of the number of calculations you would have to do just to make the most simple of connections. There is a varitable infinity of monads just making up your body, how could you ever be able to do the calculations necessary to fully understand how each one interacts with all the others in the universe in the past present and future? For us existing in the world that we live in, it is much more efficient to just run experiments using our senses and through pattern recognition try to arrive at a conclusion about what causes or heals cancer based on way less trials.\n\nBut the theoretical concept that it is possible is a powerful one. See when we arrive at truth, as humans, Leibniz thinks it is important that we make the distinction between what he calls the kinds of truth. This is one of the most important parts of his philosophy and it is going to have very real implications on next week\u2019s show. Leibniz says that whenever something is true it is either a truth of reasoning or a truth of fact.\n\nYou may feel familiar with what were talking about here if you think back to the episode on Avicenna when we talked about necessary existents vs contingent existents\u2026well truths of reasoning are necessary truths and truths of fact are contingent truths. Let me explain:\n\nA necessary truth is a truth that NEEDS to be true. There is no way it CANT be true because to suggest anything otherwise would be a contradiction based on the definition of the thing. For example, If I say pentagons have five sides\u2026that is a necessary truth. there are no four or six sided pentagons, because if they DID have four or six sides they wouldn\u2019t be a pentagon anymore. Pentagons by definition have 5 sides. My favorite one that I\u2019ve heard is that all bachelors are unmarried. This is a really good one because it illustrates how this can apply in the real world. You can\u2019t be a bachelor and be married\u2026if you were married\u2026you would lose your membership to the bachelor club\u2026there is no reason for us to run all around the world and make sure that all bachelors are definitely married because if they were married\u2026they wouldn\u2019t be a bachelor anymore. This is an example of a truth of reason. Truth can be arrived at through rational reflection alone.\n\nA contingent truth is one that may be true right now, but stating the opposite of it would not be a contradiction. The opposite could ALSO be true. For example, the light is on in the other room. Sure, I could get up, walk into the other room and see that the light is on\u2026and it certainly is a true statement. But it could NOT be true some other time. Now if you were going to try to arrive at knowledge about our place in the natural world, which kind of truth would you want in an ideal scenario. I mean, just imagine living in a single room in a giant sprawling mansion on the countryside\u2026one of these homes with over a hundred bedrooms. And you\u2019ve only lived in that room your entire life and one day you decide you are going to move outside your room and try to understand more about this mansion that you live in. Now imagine that in every room surrounding you, some really inconsiderate person that stayed there before left the lights on but in every other room the lights were off.\n\nYou might do your scientific experiments and conclude that you exist in a mansion where every single room in the mansion has the lights on. Now what if a janitor comes around and turns the lights off one day. How confused will you be? How much time have you wasted in the process? But is the time truly wasted? Thank you for sticking with me today, I look forward to continuing this conversation with you about Leibniz on next weeks episode. Talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\n1 Comment"}, "episode_33": {"date": "2014-11-4", "text": "Posted on November 4, 2014\nEpisode 41 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #041 on Belief. Check out the episode page HERE.\nThe best episodes of this show, for me at least, are the ones that correspond with events that go on in my everyday life. Part of my research for the show goes beyond just reading through dry philosophy\u2026I usually read what I need to\u2026mull it over for a while\u2026go on a few walks thinking about it\u2026and then arrive at a few core questions that I want to address in the show that week and what I usually do, because I am a tremendously annoying person, is I subject everyone around me that seems remotely interested to those questions\u2026 my wife and closest friends absolutely love me for this quality of myself\u2026and The main question for this week that cause some distress was how do you justify what you believe?\nNow you can imagine the kind of reception I get asking people this stuff\u2026why do people get so uncomfortable when you ask them to explain what they believe\u2026and for a long time I didn\u2019t know why\u2026its not like I\u2019m aggressive in these conversations\u2026I go out of my way to coddle people in these conversations. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel bad\u2026my goal in every conversation that I have is to have the person leave a little bit more joyful than they came into it\u2026but then I realized\u2026I\u2019m fighting a losing battle. When it comes to what people believe about stuff\u2026in today\u2019s modern American society\u2026we\u2019re not supposed to ask those kind of questions. We\u2019re not supposed to press people about WHY they believe certain things they believe\u2026there is a HUGE double standard\u2026we\u2019re supposed to ridicule some types of beliefs but have unquestionable reverence for others that are very similar. This is why people feel uncomfortable when they\u2019re asked to justify their beliefs\u2026social conventions keep them in this protective cocoon! Well just for this episode of the show\u2026let\u2019s break out of that cocoon and try to understand our beliefs better\u2026and then you can go back inside.\nNow earlier in the week I was having a perfect conversation for this very topic\u2026I was talking to some guy that believes in ghosts. Now I want to come back to this guy, but first lets do a little digging on the concept of belief, because what I think we\u2019ll all realize soon, something that Voltaire would\u2019ve DEFINITELY agreed with\u2026is that this strange condition that we\u2019re born into\u2026this crazy carnival ride that we\u2019re on that we call life, when it comes to belief\u2026it all begins to look like a really sick joke that someone is playing on us. Let me explain why.\nWhen we are born into the world\u2026we are born into a very strange condition. When it comes to arriving at beliefs about stuff\u2026there are two GIANT things about this condition that we find ourselves in that make believing in anything very complicated. The first thing\u2026a very important thing\u2026is that certainty\u2026for all intents and purposes is impossible. In fact, we can\u2019t even be certain about the fact that certainty is impossible\u2026but if certainty IS possible\u2026finding it through all the the various handicaps that humans have seems to be a wild goose chase. Voltaire had a famous quote that said, \u201cDoubt is an unpleasant condition, but certainty is absurd\u201d\nNow what Voltaire and many of the enlightenment thinkers are getting at here is that you don\u2019t KNOW anything for CERTAIN. You can have very strong beliefs\u2026backed by very strong evidence that is constantly reinforced by your experience and still not know something for CERTAIN. Take one of the most seemingly obviously existing I can think of\u2026the physical world. I look around me everywhere and it SEEMS like other people exist\u2026it seems like trees and cars and everything else exists\u2026it seems like there is a physical matter underneath this map of the world that I see that is creating this reality\u2026but do I know for certain that it exists? I could just be talking to myself into empty space hallucinating all of this. In fact, can I even be certain that I exist at all? Can I be certain that I am a thinking thing as Descartes famously said?\nWell many people would argue\u2026no. People cite the Cartesian circle\u2026His so called clear and distinct ideas are based on thoughts which could have been deceptive from the very beginning. He isn\u2019t certain of anything. So what does all of this mean? What are the implications of this?\nHere it is: To believe in anything, to claim to know anything no matter the amount of empirical evidence or reasoning\u2026is a leap of faith. Even something that is imminently in front of us at all times like the physical world with an endless amount of evidence\u2026if you claim to KNOW that it exists\u2026sit down and have a Starbucks with an idealist philosopher for 10 minutes and they will show you how many assumptions you are making. To believe in ANYTHING is a leap of faith\u2026but hold on\u2026.one of the biggest mistakes in thinking that people make here\u2026that that therefore makes all leaps of faith and all beliefs the exact same thing.\nWe may all be making leaps of faith all the time, but all leaps of faith are not created equal. And this brings me to the next very strange thing about this condition that we\u2019re born into as human beings\u2026We can believe, literally\u2026ANYTHING that we want to believe. What I mean by that is that what you believe has absolutely NOTHING to do with how true it is. And if you doubt this at any level\u2026just consider the fact that there are millions of examples of beliefs that people hold that are mutually exclusive.\nConsider the fact that some people believe in ghosts\u2026that\u2019s what this guy was talking about earlier this week\u2026he was telling me about the most recent installment into the horror genre\u2026Annabelle\u2026that movie about the doll that is possessed by a demon. And for future listeners I\u2019m sorry if this dates the show or if the reference doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, but it is the same generic story about an attractive young couple getting some new material possession that becomes unfortunately claimed by Satan\u2019s henchmen. I\u2019m sure there is some future movie that is still appealing to these fears that people have so just replace Annabelle with whatever is prevalent during your time. But what this guy was doing was he was reading me a story about how the doll of the movie Annabelle is based on actual events\u2026that there was a couple that got a doll and they would come home from the supermarket and the doll had changed places and changed positions and one night their door creaked open and the doll was standing there and it came into the room and tried to strangle the husband.\nWell in fairness to me I thought he was joking\u2026and I started poking fun at holes in the story or just generally talking about the whole situation\u2026just that there exists an underworld where demons are holding human souls captive\u2026and one of the lords of the underworld decides to take a liking to these people\u2019s baby\u2026he wants her soul\u2026so his best plan is to take control of a creepy looking doll and mess with them for weeks\u2026you know\u2026flicking lights on and off\u2026moving the curtains\u2026putting the doll in random places\u2026opening doors when no ones around\u2026this is what the demon spends his time doing. And really I\u2019m completely open to the idea of all this stuff existing\u2026I\u2019m an agnostic when it comes to ghosts, demons and evil spirits at this point in my life\u2026it certainly would make the world an interesting place\u2026but I try to make people laugh and when I pointed this stuff out the guy that was reading me the story goes, \u201cWait\u2026you don\u2019t believe this happened?\u201d\nNow although I am an agnostic on the issue\u2026I have met people throughout the course of my life who feel the exact opposite of this guy\u2026they say that ghosts do not exist. They\u2019ll say\u2026Why haven\u2019t we captured them on video if everyone has a smart phone? This is nothing more than superstitious people with a confirmation bias. They are told that they have a soul or a spirit their whole life by different people\u2026maybe their mother tells them a story about seeing her mom at the foot of her bed when she was younger\u2026so when they are told about demons existing or ghosts haunting a designated property line\u2026it isn\u2019t THAT outside what they\u2019ve been told is acceptable to believe so they believe it. If you told these people there were goblins in the trees that were always watching you\u2026they wouldn\u2019t believe it because it isn\u2019t similar to what they were told was reasonable when they were growing up\u2026but in reality these people say\u2026goblins and ghosts are equally as unfounded and ridiculous.\nSome people vehemently believe in ghosts some people vehemently believe ghosts do not exist. But who is right? They can\u2019t both be right. The two viewpoints directly contradict each other\u2026one of them or neither of them has to be right. Yet both sides are devout believers of their side of the equation.\nThe point of this, aside from setting up this extended example of ghosts is to illustrate that someone believing in something has nothing to do with how true it is. We can believe in ANYTHING we want. And it\u2019s funny because if you asked 100 people why they hold the beliefs they do\u202699 of that hundred would say that they believe things because it is the truth. Maybe complete certainty about things is impossible, but what I believe is the closest facsimile of truth possible. We all believe the things we believe because we think they are the closest thing to truth we have come across.\nWell, like most things in philosophy\u2026I wish it was this simple. Press those 99 out of 100 people hard enough on explaining WHY they believe what they believe and what you will find is that they believe things for a lot of reasons\u2026not many of them having anything to do with truth necessarily in the slightest bit. I\u2019m not just making this up\u2026the dozens of different justifications for a belief in something is an entire field of study in philosophy today. There are so many ways people distort reality to convince themselves that something is true that you could truly spend the rest of your life reading about the work that has been done in this small segment. People believe things because they are convenient to believe in, they believe things because it useful to them on a personal level, they believe in things out of laziness\u2026it is very difficult to accept reality on reality\u2019s terms\u2026so leave it to us to come up with tons of creative ways to believe in something and create the reality that we want to exist.\nNow it should be said that false beliefs that are useful are not necessarily bad things. The longer I live on this planet the more I realize how powerful of a tool belief is. There are tons of examples\u2026simply believing that you can\u2019t do something can make you incapable of accomplishing it. Just Believing that you live in a world where people are keeping you down can cause you to believe that any bad thing that happens to you is the byproduct of these people that are oppressing you. So we shouldn\u2019t look down on false beliefs because they can be extremely useful.\nCertainty is impossible and there are no limits to what you can believe. This is one of the biggest messages of the podcast right here and it is one that was very dear to Voltaire and the rest of the enlightenment thinkers. If you\u2019re a person who claims that the basis for why you believe the things you do is because you think they are true and not because they serve some useful purpose to you then you are instantly assuming a life long responsibility. A life long responsibility of putting your beliefs under a microscope. A life long responsibility of looking at them through an extremely critical lens. Of taking every piece of new information you get and weighing your beliefs against it. If you are TRULY concerned with your beliefs being true, you should never arrive at a belief and say that it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says to me, it doesn\u2019t matter which new facts are presented to me, I will never falter from this belief. You can\u2019t say that.\nNo one said this was going to be easy. The easy way is deciding you are going to plug your ears and say \u201cla la la\u201d whenever someone tells you something that doesn\u2019t correspond with your worldview. You\u2019re not a bad person if you do this, but the enlightenment thinkers would at least want you to be honest that your beliefs are out of convenience, not out of a desire for truth. Not everybody is cut out for this kind of life. Some people have a hard time committing to getting a puppy because\u2026think of the responsibility! For the next 10 years or more I have to take care of this thing\u2026Well this is a LIFE LONG commitment.\nAnd I have more news for you\u2026this whole process is going to be an uphill battle because there are way more ways you can be wrong about what you believe than right. Plato talks at the end of the Theatetus about the idea of what knowledge is\u2026it\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about on the show before I\u2019m pretty sure\u2026the idea that knowledge is only knowledge when it is a justified, true, belief in something. Now, it should be said that this isn\u2019t a knockdown explanation of what knowledge is\u2026people have found exceptions to this rule, but it works really well when talking about any shaky beliefs that we might be holding on to.\nPicture a Venn Diagram where one circle is truth and the other circle is belief. In each of these circles is everything that is true and everything that you believe. Now, lets assume you have some beliefs that correspond with reality on realities terms\u2026or truth\u2026the two circles of your beliefs and truth would overlap in the middle\u2026but Plato thinks that this overlapped area is not knowledge yet, because your true beliefs need to be properly justified.\nI HATE describing visuals on this show\u2026let me give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about and the point of this is to consider ALL THE wonderful DIFFERENT WAYS you could be wrong about something and how much scrutiny it takes to have a justified, true, belief. You could be a commoner living in the 1400\u2019s in Europe and listen to the stories of the sea faring gentlemen telling their tales about the ends of the earth. The point when you\u2019ve sailed so far out into the ocean that you fall off the edge\u2026you believe the earth is flat in other words. Well that would be an example of something that ONLY falls in the belief column. You believe the world is flat\u2026that is a belief of yours, but when it comes to it being true or justified\u2026in retrospect, now we know that that belief isn\u2019t true and it certainly isn\u2019t justified simply because you heard someone talk about it in the 1400\u2019s.\nLet\u2019s take another example\u2026let\u2019s say you\u2019re still living in the 1400\u2019s and you believed that the earth was a sphere because you also believe that all the planets in the universe are just marbles in a massive celestial game of marbles. Well, that\u2019s a great example of a belief\u2026that happens to be true, but it isn\u2019t properly justified so it wouldn\u2019t be considered knowledge to Plato.\nThis is when the tapestry of our beliefs starts to unravel. Consider all the different ways you could be wrong about any one thing you believe, or all the different justifications you could be covertly using as a basis for believing something out of convenience alone. Consider the fact that you live in a world where it is very unnatural to question people about these justifications.\nNow, Consider the very few ways you can be right. And if you\u2019re having a hard time taking a step back and looking at your beliefs through this objective lens\u2026you know identifying the possible ways you could be inappropriately justifying your beliefs, take yourself out of this equation and try to think about the way you are critical of the beliefs of others that you don\u2019t agree with.\nLet\u2019s all think back to a time when we had a friend that we fundamentally disagreed with about something. Maybe you agreed with this person the majority of the time, but on this one issue\u2026they were dead wrong. You were right. You could clearly see all the mistakes they were making\u2026all the ways they were believing this thing that they believed in out of convenience to them\u2026 rather than because they thought it was the truth. You guys had to \u201cagree to disagree\u201d. Well at this point\u2026if somebody showed you a list of faulty justifications\u2026you could easily point out which ones they were guilty of in that case, so make no mistake \u2026 you are already good at holding beliefs under a microscope.\nLet\u2019s consider an example that we can all be familiar with and it was one that was very important to the enlightenment thinkers, especially when it comes to religious toleration. Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m a Christian. There are a LOT of people that disagree with me throughout human history and across the world living today that I have to contend with. We\u2019ll talk about several of them\u2026but let\u2019s start with the growing vocal minority\u2026the Atheists.\nThese people DON\u2019T believe in the Christian God\u2026.I do believe in the Christian God. Well, like we talked about with ghosts before\u2026one thing\u2019s for certain, we can\u2019t BOTH be right. The Christian god can\u2019t both exist AND not exist simultaneously. So if their belief that there is no God is not in the truth circle on our Venn Diagram\u2026then we should be able to find some sort of faulty justification for believing what they believe. There are no shortage of these if you look for them\u2026one of the most common ones leveraged is that Atheists are nothing more than rebellious teenagers. That they lack humility. They\u2019re blaring emo music in their room and refusing to acknowledge the tremendous gift that the Christian God has given them because then they would have to follow his rules\u2026these people are selfish and don\u2019t want to\u2026 and they will pay with eternal torment.\nNow on the other hand, Atheists commonly say the same thing about Christians. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard it\u2026that it\u2019s in fact the Christians that lack humility. That it is difficult to think of something more arrogant or self-important than the idea that the ENTIRE UNIVERSE was put here so that you could talk to other humans nicely. Now let\u2019s look at this..right here, the Atheist is attacking the Christian\u2019s justification for believing what they do\u2026 and the Christian commonly says back that their justification has nothing to do with truth or convenience\u2026they just chose to believe. They just\u2026believe\u2026based on faith. God has already said what he is going to say, Yes he sits behind the scenes working tirelessly to conceal himself from everyone all the time, but the good news is.. if you just have faith and believe in him\u2026then his existence will become self-evident\u2026you will look around you and it will be obvious that he exists.\nBut there\u2019s a whole other side to this isn\u2019t there? The Christians have another enemy that they march into battle against every day\u2026and their name is: the tens of billions of people who have lived throughout history and the billions of people that are currently living who believe in a different God than the Christian God. If you are a Christian\u2026you disagree with the majority of humans that have ever lived. You think they have chosen to believe in the wrong God. Billions upon billions of people that devoutly believe in, claim to have personal relationships with, direct communication to, or more-so throughout history, obvious interaction with their God. Billions of people that have the same transcendent experiences that Christians have and strong connection to their God, are wrong. And they did it all from the exact same mental starting point as any Christian living beyond the first century AD when these miracles perpetrated by God could have been witnessed.\nNow these people, to the Christian\u2026are NOT rebellious teenager\u2026in fact many of them subject themselves to a more restrictive code of behaviors than the Christians do. So what is the justification for their beliefs? All of these people used the exact same justification for their beliefs that the Christian did, the difference between them is that the Christian believes either that they happened to be born into the right home or had some sort of insight that gave them confidence they were right, and the vast majority of humans who have ever lived are burning in hell for picking incorrectly.\nNow, the two ways Christians typically respond to this in modern times, at least by my experience is by shaking their heads and saying \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m confused by that too, the lord works in mysterious ways.\u201d Or by saying that they just don\u2019t believe God would do that. That the majestic God presented in the Bible is Good and Just and they just can\u2019t believe that God would sentence all of these people to eternal torture for not believing in Christianity.\nThe common thing I usually hear back from Islamic Scholars or Rabbis or just a general Agnostic is, well you\u2019re directly flying in the face of thousands of years of Christianity by saying that and how convenient for you to cherry pick scripture and ignore other scripture to create a new modern, more tolerant version of God that doesn\u2019t send anyone to hell for believing the wrong thing.\nThe point of this is not to attack one set of beliefs\u2026it is to illustrate the responsibility we have if we want our beliefs to be based on truth, rather than what we want truth to be. If you don\u2019t believe things based on convenience, you need to be subjecting your beliefs to this level of scrutiny constantly\u2026every belief. And This scrutiny that we can hold things to on a personal level is what the thinkers in the enlightenment did hundreds of years ago when it comes to the collective knowledge of humanity. We can see this period known as the enlightenment as the human species going through this process for the first time. The only question is, will you have your own personal enlightenment?\nWhen I talked to this guy earlier this week about why he believes in ghosts\u2026when he asked me why I didn\u2019t believe the story in the news about the doll that was possessed by a demon and tried to strangle the woman\u2019s husband, I tried to get to the bottom of where his personal line in the sand is. He must not believe EVERY story that he reads\u2026.I pointed out that there are tons of examples of stories that he doesn\u2019t believe are true\u2026the stories about ships falling off of the earth because they reached the edge\u2026the particularly far fetched stories of people getting abducted by aliens\u2026etc. I asked him where he draws the line when it comes to believing in the testimony of others, because he MUST have one.\nSome people believe testimony because, why would it benefit someone to openly come out with the information that they were kidnapped by lizard people and anally probed? What possible benefit could they get from telling the rest of society about that\u2026they must be telling the truth! Well there ARE motivations in every example if you look hard enough, not the least of which might be mental illness, but my point is that motivations or lack of motivations don\u2019t necessarily make things true or untrue.\nEventually where we got in the conversation is him saying that he believes in ghosts because it augments his living experience. When he goes to the movies and watches a story about a demon haunting a house, he doesn\u2019t just appreciate things like , whoa that was a nice special effect there, or wow what a great acting performance\u2026he watches it thinking that it actually happened and that at any point it could happen to him. He also said that he really likes the idea of believing in a spirit world beyond this planet because he is terrified of the idea of dying and believing there is somewhere for him to go after living makes him feel comforted because now he will never have to actually fade into blackness.\nWell after listening to this episode, I don\u2019t have to tell any of YOU guys why that is a faulty justification for believing in something. But what I will tell you is how Voltaire, Newton Locke and many other thinkers agreed with and embraced the task presented to humanity that we talked about in this episode. Real quickly though, the point of this episode is that every belief you hold is a leap of faith\u2026but not all leaps of faith are created equal. If I could give you one piece of advice: QUESTION YOUR FAITH CONSTANTLY. This may seem abrasive, but it\u2019s not\u2026if I asked you to question your faith about whether heroine was a good idea\u2026if I asked you to question your faith about whether eradicating minorities was a good idea\u2026if I asked you to question your faith about whether the world is a dark dangerous place that isn\u2019t worth living in\u2026you would be thanking me. Remember, if certainty is all but impossible and we can believe LITERALLY ANYTHING we want, if we truly want our beliefs to be as close to the truth as possible, we have a life long responsibility to look at our beliefs under a microscope.\nThere was a really fun question being asked about human history during the lifetime of Voltaire\u2026who is the greatest of ALL the human heroes? Was it Alexander the Great? For uniting Greece and spreading Hellenism? What it Julius Caesar? For bringing Rome to unprecedented greatness? Voltaire had a very different answer to this question\u2026he believed that the greatest human hero was Sir Isaac Newton\u2026because while Caesar and Alexander and many others had brought change by way of the sword that lasted maybe a couple centuries, Sir Isaac Newton FOREVER revolutionized the way that humans look at the world they live in.\nBefore Newton, people like Descartes talked about how knowledge should be arrived at through an almost mathematical process. That we begin with clear and distinct ideas\u2026things that are either innate in our minds or self-evident\u2026and from there we use reason to DEDUCE what the truth is. Well, Voltaire\u2019s views on the matter were derived from Locke\u2026who strongly disagreed.\nAristotle said that \u201chumans by nature desire to know\u201d. One of the most depressing things you can ever hear is that you have reached your full potential at something. That, no matter how hard you work or try from here on out, you will never be ANY better than you are at this moment right now. In that same way, how sad is it to hear that we have found the absolute truth\u2026that everything else you will ever say will be readdressing some earlier point or commentary on what we already know.\nVoltaire and Locke are not filled with the same kind of desperation as others who are willing to create vast metaphysical explanations of the universe that really have no basis other than flawed reasoning just so they can say that they KNOW things. Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Plotinus\u2019s theory of the One, Leibniz\u2019s Monadology, all rationalist metaphysical systems aimed at taking what they claim to be self evident knowledge and speculating the rest based on their own human brains.\nVoltaire and Locke are more interested in looking at how things seem to interact with each other in a measurable way than with creating some story to explain to holes that we haven\u2019t filled in yet. Now don\u2019t get them wrong\u2026This kind of philosophical speculation is still an important tool, but it shouldn\u2019t be what we base truth upon. Philosophy will always be useful\u2026because in this way, philosophy is the great engine of hypothesis\u2026\nThink about science for a second\u2026what makes a great scientist? a great scientist is someone who can take some falsifiable hypothesis and come up with an experiment where at the end of the experiment, the only possible outcome is that the hypothesis is proven correct, or incorrect\u2026and they do this in as unbiased and humble of a way as possible. But there\u2019s another half to that\u2026where do we get the outside the box hypotheses that lead to progress? Both the philosopher and the scientist are brilliant, but in different ways\u2026it takes a different kind of brilliance to come up with new theories or to recognize assumptions we might be making in science currently. Plato\u2026Plotinus..Leibniz\u2026all of these metaphysical systems can be seen as hypotheses for scientists to test\u2026and yes ultimately most of them wont hold up to scrutiny, but one of them might be another Newton. Philosophy is the great engine of hypothesis.\nVoltaire would\u2019ve agreed that these systems are educated guesses\u2026but their validity ends there. He thought that for whatever reason\u2026if God existed\u2026us knowing FOR CERTAIN that he exists isn\u2019t that important to him\u2026so instead of speculating about the \u201cnature\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d of things or creating elaborate systems explaining scientific holes\u2026we should study what we actually were given. The natural world. Ourselves\u2026etc.\nVoltaire thought that maybe science will NEVER be able to answer these questions fully..but when he was in doubt he really liked a quote that was popular by Newton at the time, \u201cWhen I don\u2019t know something\u2026I will not feign a hypothesis.\u201d He was fine with the condition he was in: \u201cDoubt is an unpleasant condition\u2026but certainty is absurd.\u201d\nAlright so last time when I chose a winner for the $20 Amazon gift card I ended up rambling for almost 25 minutes about it\u2026got a few complaints\u2026want to make sure I keep it short this time since the episode is already running late as is.

That said, the one this week is from Chris Ruby he writes,\n\u201cJust made another large order through your amazon banner and I thought you might do me a favor and suggest a book or two on tape for the 16hr drive I\u2019m making to Colorado\u2026 Yea, downloaded audible through you a while back. Art of racing in the rain was my free download, and I recommend it highly.\u201d\nWell thank you Chris\u2026I would love to weigh in on this\u2026and thank you for participating and listening to the show. One book that I always recommend to people\u2026it is one of my favorite books is called Socrates Meets Jesus\u2026The premise of the book is that Socrates inexplicably is manifested in modern times and is taking a course on the history of Christianity. The other students in the class represent some typical stereotypical viewpoints in today\u2019s world on certain issues\u2026and the whole book has Socrates constantly doing what he did best\u2026Socratic Dialogue..questioning and trying to get to the bottom of contemporary society and Christianity. Most people that hate on the book are hating on the ending because Socrates converts to Christianity and they see it as a cheap religiously fueled cop out\u2026but I don\u2019t care. The book is full of awesome discussion\u2026it\u2019s actually been made into a full length play that you can watch on YouTube.\nThe other book I\u2019d recommend is \u201cZen and the art of motorcycle maintenance\u201d. Its cheap, relatively short and one of the greatest books ever. It is about a father and son that take a motorcycle road trip over the summer and their discussions lead to extremely powerful conclusions when it comes to tolerance and how to live life. Can\u2019t recommend this book enough.\nThat does it for the show\u2026send it your questions over Facebook, twitter, or email and enter for your chance to win a $20 Amazon gift card\u2026talk to you soon.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_34": {"date": "2014-11-5", "text": "Posted on November 5, 2014\nEpisode 40 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #040 on Superstition. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe theme of today\u2019s episode is superstition. What is superstition? You know, when we think of superstitious people in modern times what do we think about\u2026we usually think about really extreme, silly forms of superstition. People say and think stuff like\u2026this terrible thing happened to me today\u2026today is Friday the thirteenth\u2026the reason this bad thing happened is because Friday the thirteenth is an unlucky day. Unlucky things just happen on Friday the 13th. People will say things like, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. The reason why I haven\u2019t had to go to the doctor for a while is because I have been eating my daily apple every single day. That\u2019s the reason why. But lets dissect that thinking a little bit, because superstition doesn\u2019t need to be this ridiculous.\nLet\u2019s just think about what superstition is. The dictionary defines superstition as: falsely attributing some cause to some effect. For example, it\u2019s the APPLE that is preventing me from ever having to go to the doctor. But when you start to think about superstition in these terms, and you think about it for a while, you start to realize that being superstitious is not something reserved just for pirates from the 1800\u2019s\u2013most people, wake up every morning and live their lives with an incredibly superstitious outlook on the world that they\u2019re trying to navigate. This isn\u2019t because they are bad people or stupid people, they are just mistaken about the causes of things.\nNow what am I talking about here? Well, I could point out the avid sports fan that watches the game every Sunday and has a very deliberate ritual that he executes completely convinced that at some level, the type of beer that he drinks is going to affect the outcome of the game. But obviously that is just a much more modern and accepted version of how the Atlantic Pirates were thinking in the 1800\u2019s\u2026but what about the superstitions we hold when it comes to something like happiness? If superstition is the act of someone mistaking a cause with an effect, then don\u2019t many of us walk around with incredibly superstitious beliefs all the time?\nWell just to illustrate what I am talking about\u2026let\u2019s talk about happiness for a second. Most people come into the world and they realize pretty quickly that they want to be happy. So what do they do? They look around them and try to find people that seem happy and then try to emulate them. Unfortunately, they usually start at the wrong places. They find some rich people living on the water with a house\u2026a white picket fence\u2026two cars and a big screen TV and they superstitiously conclude that the cause of their happiness has to be all of these material things that they have. After all, what is the most obvious difference between them and me? Has to be the jet skis.\nSo this person goes on a while thinking this way and if they don\u2019t just throw their hands in the air and resign themselves from the pursuit of understanding things, their thoughts on happiness evolve because they eventually realize that there are plenty of rich people, or people that have lots of stuff that are absolutely miserable. There must be something else, it must not be the material stuff that is making these people happy. Maybe this person reads a little Socrates..they hear happy is he who is content with the least\u2026.and he concludes that happiness REALLY lies in low expectations.\nAfter all, it seems clear that I get mad when I have some expectation that is not being met, so if I make an effort to only expect the bare minimum\u2026enough food to get through the day, clothes on my back and a roof over my head, then anything else that comes my way is going to be a pleasant surprise. So this person goes on for a while and they superstitiously conclude that happiness must lie in low expectations.\nOne day, maybe they are thinking about stuff and they ask the question, well, what if even my most basic needs weren\u2019t met. would I NEED to be unhappy? no, even if you don\u2019t collect enough food to feed yourself for the day, you can still choose to be accepting of that and therefore be content. So, this person would conclude perhaps superstitiously that happiness lies in acceptance.\nBut then what is acceptance? I mean, if you think about it, isn\u2019t acceptance a two part thing? On one hand it is accepting everything that\u2019s happened in your past\u2026including everything that you have, both the contents of your mind and the contents of your storage unit with all your stuff in it. But on the other hand its about accepting everything that will happen in your future\u2026any future adversity or trials that you could possibly go through. So if acceptance is just accepting the past and the future, is happiness really just being fully present in this moment? Is this the reason why we try to make money in the first place? To get to a place where we don\u2019t need to worry about any future adversity because we have a surplus? Or is this yet another superstitious conclusion?\nThe point of this is that superstition is something that were all guilty of on an every day basis, and I\u2019m not just talking about happiness. This is a really effective exercise\u2026try asking yourself what things you might be superstitiously concluding\u2026mistaking a particular cause for a particular effect? But then again, this is kind of paradoxical\u2026if you knew what things you were being superstitious about, you wouldn\u2019t be mistaking them in the first place. Well the two thinkers we\u2019re going to talk about today both attacked this monster named superstition in different ways. Superstition was a huge enemy during this period we\u2019re heading into known as the enlightenment.\nNow in the context of history the enlightenment is a very short period of time\u2026the vast majority of it is made up by three generations of people that all have revolutionary ideas on the backs of each other. To me this is absolutely incredible\u2026and it just goes to show you the rate of progress that was going on during this time period. I mean a period that we call \u201cTHE enlightenment\u201d? and it took place over the course of this short period of time? Pretty incredible.\nThere\u2019s many different ways people try to describe the enlightenment, but lets not get too crazy\u2026there is far from a consensus on the matter. Let\u2019s talk about a few of them though. Some historians think the enlightenment can be seen as the ultimate awakening of mankind\u2026the moment when science and these new political institutions finally allowed for dogma and tradition and faith based thinking to get completely tossed out of the way of progress. They think this is the time period when the snowball of reason finally started rolling downhill. But then there are other people who think that this snowball of reason had been rolling since the beginning of the middle ages.\nThey say that once religion and Aristotle established their monopoly on human thought, reason started chipping away and slowly but surely they eventually brought it down. The enlightenment is just the culmination of over a thousand years of effort by brilliant thinkers. There are other people that think the enlightenment was fueled by the counter-reformation in the church\u2026there are people that think the enlightenment was a myth and that these thinkers were just being propped up to add legitimacy to the new ways of thinking.\nRegardless of what the truth is about the enlightenment, it was a massively transformative period of time that is distinguished from others by the attempt by great thinkers to abolish superstition in all areas of thought. Now one person that was attempting to abolish a very specific type of superstition was the guy we ended the show with last week\u2026his name was Bishop Berkeley.\nNow Berkeley can be seen as someone who is aiming to abolish superstition when it comes to us perceiving things with our senses in the natural world. After all, isn\u2019t the veil of perception a possible superstition? As we talked extensively about last time, philosophers from the dawn of empiricism have realized that what we perceive with our senses is not reality as it truly is\u2026there is some deeper reality underneath and what we perceive is the crude outline of that reality that our sense organs create. Perfectly useful to us when it comes to survival, but far from actual reality. This is known as the veil of perception. The only thing we really have access to is an IDEA of reality created inside our minds. Well Berkeley asked the question, why do we even need to assume that there is some fundamental reality underneath that is causing these ideas. After all, the only thing we truly interact with is this idea of reality\u2026how can we be sure that our ideas of reality are not the only things that exist?\nIn other words, let\u2019s end this potential superstition that the cause of our senses perceiving the world in the way they do is some different, more real reality underneath. Berkeley was what is known as an immaterialist idealist. Contrary to people like Descartes and other people that lived around this time who believed the universe was comprised of mind and matter, he was a monist and he believed that that one substance that the universe is made of is mind. He didn\u2019t believe in material substances as philosophers typically accepted were there. After all, Berkeley was an empiricist\u2026all knowledge is derived from sense experience\u2026but we never actually experience this supposed more real world out there.\nHave you ever had someone ask you the really generic question\u2026if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to watch it fall to the ground, does it actually fall? Berkeley would say that in theory if there was nobody no thing around to perceive it, it wouldn\u2019t exist, but that doesn\u2019t really matter because he believed that there is one entity that is perpetually aware of everything in the universe and that entity is known as, you guessed it\u2026capital G o d. God.\nShazam. Drops the mic. No further questions your honor. Now look, we could spend a lot of time fleshing out his full system, true reality is comprised of spirits, both God and many little finite spirits, but I thought about it and ultimately I think the real contribution that Berkeley made to philosophy is by being the FIRST in what would become a very important line of thinking. Most of the meat of his view of the universe is trying to preserve the idea of God\u2026trying to make God not only the creator of the universe but the all powerful entity that endlessly provides us with our perceptions and is intimately involved with everything in the universe. In other words\u2026don\u2019t even THINK about saying that God isn\u2019t necessary. In this way, he may have run into the same mistake Leibniz made with his Monadology. I don\u2019t think it is worth your time talking about his individual system, I think we need to see him as having a really unique insight about the assumptions we make when we perceive the world, and that really unique insight gave rise to a tradition known as Idealism. Trust me on this, there are far more fascinating people that we can use to delve deep into the area of thought known as Idealism\u2026and I\u2019m just going to be honest\u2026it\u2019s going to be Immanuel Kant. Let\u2019s wait to understand all of the ins and outs of Idealism in relation to Kant.\nBut one other really noteworthy thing about Berkeley is for us to understand why he arrived at this line of reasoning in the first place. I mean, why question the physical world that supposedly exists underneath this outline of the world that our senses draw? This is really interesting\u2026he may have arrived at a place where he WANTED that underlying reality to exist because he was trying to preserve the idea of God. Remember, Descartes and Locke and others believed that the universe was made up of multiple substances\u2026one of those substances was matter. The really interesting thing to consider is what Berkeley was worried was going to happen. What are the implications of saying that matter is a substance? Well what he was worried about happening is that once you declare that matter is a substance, and it\u2019s existence explains itself\u2026what is to stop the scientific community and the world for that matter from removing God from the equation? I mean\u2026who is to say if matter is a substance that God didn\u2019t just create the world and leave it to work itself out on its own? What Berkeley wanted to make sure of was that whatever worldview he presented it was not only going to have God at the center of it, but God was going to be central to maintaining it. Then once he started thinking about it he said..hmm why do we need to assume this physical stuff exists at all?\nSo, ironically, Berkeley fought on this battle front to end superstition when it comes to the way we perceive the world\u2026and fighting on a completely separate battle-front\u2026one that was attempting to cut the legs out from underneath the religion that Berkeley subscribed to\u2026was a guy who went by the name of Voltaire. To sum up his views mildly, Voltaire wasn\u2019t a big fan of the religion of his day.\n\nIn one of Voltaire\u2019s books called Philosophical Dictionary, he is having a conversation with a spirit or ghost, its eluded to that it is Jesus, \u201cTell me if there have been peoples other than the Christians and the Jews in whom zeal and religion wretchedly transformed into fanaticism, have inspired so many horrible cruelties.\u201d The spirit replies \u201cYes, the Mohammedans were sullied with the same inhumanities, but rarely; and when one asked Amman, pity, of them, and offered them tribute, they pardoned. As for the other nations there has not been one right from the existence of the world which has ever made a purely religious war.\u201d\nLike many of the thinkers living during times when the church had considerable power, there is room for interpretation when it comes to Voltaire\u2019s precise religious views\u2026but if you read all of his work it is pretty clear his thoughts changed throughout his life. At first he was a dieist\u2026then he started considering himself a theist\u2026and it is clear that he believed in a necessary, eternal, spiritual being\u2026the god of the Cosmological argument\u2026but he took his belief in God too seriously to relegate it to a single religious viewpoint\u2026especially with all the nonsense that he thought was going on at an operational level. Some people that interpret Voltaire think that he wasn\u2019t that far away from being a christian himself and that he just needed to talk to the right people\u2026some people point to passages like this one out of a letter he wrote to Frederick II and say uh no he made it quite clear:\n\u201c[Christianity] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. \u2026 My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out..\u201d\nNow these soft caring words weren\u2019t reserved solely for Christianity\u2026he said things about Islam that if I repeat them on this show will probably get someone killed in an Embassy somewhere in the world. Just to illustrate how deep he is entrenched in all this\u2026it was very common during his time to be antisemitic. Voltaire was antisemitic, but for very different reasons than everyone else. Most people hated the Jews because they were the ones to kill Jesus. How dare they do something like that. Voltaire on the other hand hated the Jews because they made Christianity possible. That is like Inception. That is antisemitism inside of antisemitism.\nWhy is Voltaire so resistant against the religion of his time? You gotta understand, the Christianity, Judaism and Islam of his day is much different than what they are in 2014. During his lifetime\u2026they were the powerful, well-funded, enormously popular embodiment of his two biggest enemies: superstition and intolerance. He thought that God was much more than anything that these religions had ever laid out\u2026he even goes so far sometimes as to refer to them as collections of fairy tales. Now, next episode we\u2019re going to be talking more about Voltaire, but I want to talk about one of his works in particular titled, Letters Concerning the English Nation.\nLet\u2019s talk for a second about why Voltaire was writing this book. Voltaire was French. France was sitting on the sidelines watching nation after nation get wind of this new political theory by people like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau\u2026and then they would one by one fall into civil war and reform themselves into what was becoming known as a more modern structure of government\u2026one where the individual has rights and the government\u2019s role is to serve them in various ways. France hadn\u2019t had a revolution yet. England had already\u2026remember when we talked about Thomas Hobbes he was living smack dab in the middle of all the drama with the three English civil wars.\nVoltaire saw the writing on the wall. The people of France knew revolution was coming\u2026the question was when. Voltaire saw the model that England had erected and loved several elements of it\u2026after all, with their new system, England was churning out polymath geniuses one right after another\u2026John Locke, Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton\u2026etc. Why can\u2019t France have a couple of polymath geniuses? This is the question Voltaire must have been asking himself when he decided to write the book Letters Concerning the English Nation.\nHe actually writes in the beginning of the book as sort of an advertisement to the reader that these letters about the English nation are far from a tourist manual. Don\u2019t expect to read this book and find me talking about Stonehenge or any of the other sightseeing excursions that you would visit if you went there. He wasn\u2019t there to go sightseeing. He was there to understand elements of their culture and how they differ from France. And although he would never say it explicitly, in fact he wrote this book as though he was someone else, he was finding and recording the great things about the English Nation to give the revolutionaries in France a sort of framework to work from when they were designing what the country would look like after revolution. Let\u2019s create a society that is going to produce more lockes, bacons, newtons, hobbes and others.\nReally, if you think about it, if you were going to read a book about travel\u2026this is the best one you could get your hands on. This is the wisdom that comes with traveling! We\u2019ve all heard people say that if you want to become more cultured or have an eye-opening, life-changing experience\u2026you should travel the world and see other cultures. We\u2019ve all seen someone come out the other side of a World Tour and look like a changed person. But in reality\u2026it is just as easy for someone to travel from one tourist destination to the next\u2026not appreciating anything, not paying attention to the other cultures\u2026just trying to find the nearest gift shop so they can prove to their friends they went there\u2026and that person could come out on the other side of World Travel having not learned a single thing. The sort of information Voltaire is traveling to England to record is the kind of stuff that makes you a less naive, more cultured person on the other side of the trip.\nOne of the things that Voltaire notices right away\u2026and it seems like we\u2019re running out of time so I will have to pick this up next time, but he notices how incredible their system of religious toleration is. There is a section of one of the letters where he talks about an experience he had in a marketplace where crowds of people that come from completely different backgrounds and religious views are all peacefully shopping and doing business with each other. He marvels at how well everyone gets along when they are doing business with each other and then they all, at the end of the work day, go home to their respective beliefs and live their lives as they see best. And it\u2019s from here that Voltaire makes a very interesting point about religious toleration in government\u2026he asks himself why these people get along so well. He attributes it to the fact that there are so many options. He says if there was only one religion allowed, the government would be arbitrary\u2026why do we even need it at that point\u2026it either becomes unnecessary or it becomes the system of government itself.\nIf there were only two religions allowed\u2026then he says they would cut each other\u2019s throats\u2026which kind of reminds me of the always delightful stalemate between republicans vs democrats in our world\u2026but Voltaire says that because there are so many religions coexisting\u2026 that everyone gets along and no one ever feels that threatened. Religious toleration may ultimately be a way to attain peace between them.\n\nAlright so this is the end of the episode proper, and if you want to turn it off now, I fully understand. But I need to announce the winner of the Amazon Gift card this week\u2026lots of awesome entries and I am saving several of them as back ups for future weeks, in case if they are very relevant to some individual episode that we are doing. That said, I want to thank everyone who asked me questions this week and I would like to beg you to keep sending them. I read every single one and if I don\u2019t immediately respond I am considering it for the show. You know I don\u2019t want to give the answer online AND on the show. Anyway\u2026please keep asking them\u2026I implore you\u2026Have your entries in for this week before Monday evening and I look forward to hearing from you.\nAll that said\u2026the winner this week is @JessicaMMore \u2026 she asked over Twitter \u201ciamstephewest could you assess bill oreillys proof of gods existence using the tides. My husb and I love your show!\u201d\nWell of course I can! and thank you\u2026you really love my show? I would be happy to talk about Bill o reillys tide goes in tide goes out theory\u2026in fact I often times wish that I had a YouTube channel\u2026I feel like if there is something that I am really good at is identifying fallacies and weaknesses in arguments and it would be awesome to do something where I could take people\u2019s videos and give some sort of ruthless commentary on them\u2026kind of like bill oreilly. so I would love to assess his \u201cproof of gods existence\u201d even though I\u2019m pretty sure it is more of a defense of a belief in God\u2026but for anyone who hasn\u2019t heard of it before\u2026let me find the video and play it really quick\u2026he says it in multiple different interviews, but there is one with Richard Dawkins that will do just fine.\n\nThe reason bill oreilly\u2019s argument is so ridiculous is because it pretends to prove the existence of the CHRISTIAN god. He doesn\u2019t actually ever even come close to presenting a case for why it\u2019s reasonable to assume the existence of the CHRISTIAN GOD, he just gives some pathetic, fallacy ridden, hackneyed abortion of the cosmological argument proving the existence of a different God. And this is why if someone says to you that any of these modern day people\u2026if someone tells you that bill oreilly is a philosopher\u2026roll up a newspaper, smack them on the nose with it and say no! no! Philosophers in the 5th century BC were thinking clearer about these issues than he does, but as we\u2019ll find out\u2026bill oreilly isn\u2019t paid to be a philosopher\u2026he doesn\u2019t care if his argument actually holds water\u2026hes paid to keep people\u2019s eyeballs on the television screen.\nyou know I like bill oreilly. I think he is widely misunderstood because people see him take one or two ridiculous positions or stretch the truth to make his point and they disagree with him and therefore don\u2019t like him on a personal level\u2026but I love what he does. When you watch him for longer than two weeks or so you start to realize that often times he plays devils advocate for the sake of starting a conversation. He will hold some really unpopular opinion and argue it against a supposed expert for the sake of getting the discussion started. And if you think of him as someone that is starting discourse, I really like what he is doing. After all, if he never made the horrendous arguments about the tides that he did, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to rail against and point out the flaws in.\nNow that I\u2019m done saying what I like about him personally\u2026lets completely take the personal element out of it and focus on his argument itself\u2026after all I was asked by a listener to refute his tides go in tides go out proof of gods existence. I personally would consider myself an agnostic and I am not trying to be disrespectful here and I am not trying to attack the beliefs of Christians\u2026especially ones intelligent enough to listen to this show\u2026I am doing what I was asked to do\u2026attacking the argument of Bill O reilly.\n\n\u201cI just think we couldn\u2019t have lucked out to have the tides go in, tides go out, sun goes up, sun goes down. Don\u2019t think it could have happened!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith that it just happened.\u201d\nSo here if you wanted to identify the fallacies that he makes in this two sentence block they would be the appeal to probability\u2026that because something seems like it probably would be the case\u2026it therefore IS the case. And of course one of my favorite fallacies to talk about\u2026the always delightful fallacy of false equivalence where he looks at two things that have a few qualities that are the same and pretends as though they are identical things.\nSo, if you look on YouTube and you try to find these religion vs science debates\u2026you know the four horsemen of the Atheist Apocalypse\u2026this distorted argument is one of the most common things you are going to hear. What Bill O reilly is doing here is creating one of the most obvious false dichotomies I\u2019ve ever seen by an functioning adult.\n\nBill oreilly as a self-proclaimed catholic believes in the Christian God\u2026and what he\u2019s saying to Richard Dawkins is that as a self-proclaimed Atheist, the only thing that he can claim to believe in is the alternative viewpoint\u2026that something came from nothing. He looks at things in nature that seem to be perfectly ordered for humans to live in\u2026things like tide goes in tide goes out\u2026and he says I just don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve gotten that lucky! Why does this why does this seemingly ordered framework exist? Now in this case the words nature and the universe are completely interchangeable. For bill oreilly to ask why an ordered nature exists, which is what DOES exist, he is asking why does the universe exist?\nHe points out that it takes a much LARGER leap of faith to believe that it just happened\u2026that it just erupted out of nothingness one day than to believe that SOMETHING created it. Something created it. now I\u2019m going to come back to that, but id like to point out right now, that the real warped part about the way that he is arguing here is that he\u2019s using this I think SOMETHING created the universe to justify EVERY SINGLE OTHER thing he says throughout the remainder of the video. This is supposed to add legitimacy to the God that Bill oreilly defends and speaks on behalf of for the rest of the conversation.\nWell let\u2019s talk about this very intelligent and interesting question about the beginning of the universe\u2026was it created or did it arise spontaneously\u2026When we ask the question why is the universe here? Or what caused the universe come into existence in the first place\u2026 You can believe in many things and there is far from a consensus on this in philosophy or science, but there are two positions that are extremely popular in today\u2019s world that will leave you intellectually respectable\u2026One of those positions, as David Hume and others would point out is to ask the question\u2026why does the universe need a cause in the first place? Yes, that is a counter-intuitive notion, but if we completely discount that as a possibility\u2026aren\u2019t we projecting our humanity onto the universe if we claim that something NEEDS a cause to come into existence? After all we are half a chromosome away from the chimpanzee..can we really expect that we come with the hardware to fathom the origins of the universe? Let\u2019s suspend judgement on that.\nThe other way of thinking is that there was some creative force that brought the universe into existence. The thinking behind this one has to do with causality. I needed a cause to come into existence\u2026my parents had me a long time ago\u2026you needed a cause\u2026that rock needed a cause and we can go all the way back to the beginning and think that it stands to reason that because everything inside of the universe needs a cause in order to be brought into existence, why should the universe as a totality be any different? There must be some creative force behind the why the universe began.\nNow as humans, that makes total sense to us. This seems to be the point bill oreilly is arguing for\u2026that SOMETHING created the universe\u2026.But this is far from proving the existence of the God Bill O reilly has in mind isn\u2019t it? There is a massive distinction between making a case for some creative force behind the origin of the universe\u2026some metaphysical, faceless blob that brought all of this into existence\u2026there is a big difference between proving that SOMETHING created the universe, and calling that thing God as Plato and many other philosophers did\u2026and proving that that SOMETHING is also a monotheistic god, that knows you by your first name\u2026that has a plan for you\u2026that intervenes and changes the course of history\u2026that has a set of behaviors that he wants you to follow\u2026that has hands and a voice like a homo sapien\u2026that created this entire universe as some sort of elaborate moral proving ground and depending on how well you navigate the adversity and temptations he throws your way, that determines whether you get into the VIP Box in the sky or whether you perpetually burn in hell like a Ham and Cheese hot pocket.\nSo what Bill o Reilly is doing here is camouflaging himself. He is pretending that the argument hes having with Richard Dawkins is the old, intellectually respectable argument of well I believe the universe was created and YOU believe it just appeared out of nowhere\u2026and I am the crazy one huh? Well, no Bill. You aren\u2019t crazy, but you are misleading\u2026and by the way you just used the appeal to probability fallacy to try to prove your point. You aren\u2019t proving the existence of the CHRISTIAN GOD which is the one you spend the rest of the interview defending and speaking on behalf of\u2026he\u2019s pretending that by making a case for why its plausible that the universe was created\u2026he therefore PROVES the existence of all the rest of that stuff. This is the fallacy of false equivalence and there is obviously much more for bill oreilly to prove on his side than what he is pretending there is. And make no mistake\u2026Bill Oreilly is COUNTING on you to not catch this fallacy. He needs you to not catch it. Let\u2019s move on.\n\u201cJesus! see Jesus was a real guy, i could see him. I know what he did. I\u2019m not positive Jesus is god but I\u2019m throwing in with Jesus, rather than throwing in with you guys\u2026because you guys cant tell me how it all got here. You guys don\u2019t know!\u201d\nNow, if I was on the debate team and my job was to identify EXACTLY which fallacy is in this statement\u2026it\u2019s very easy. It is a very common fallacy that you see in arguments, especially by people with double digit IQs and the exact type of logical fallacy is called the argument from ignorance. The idea that because something hasn\u2019t yet been proven false that it somehow in some twisted way adds legitimacy to your beliefs no matter what they are. To take a page out of Dawkin\u2019s book, you haven\u2019t proven to me that the Easter Bunny doesn\u2019t exist, that doesn\u2019t mean that a giant rabbit hops around from house to house in April. But if you just look at what Bill is saying here:\nBill oreilly is absolutely right\u2026scientists do not know why the universe is here. but here\u2019s the kicker\u2026neither does bill. The ridiculous notion that because you don\u2019t know something that thereby gives you cart Blanche to fabricate some grandiose story to explain it, and then hold it over everyone\u2019s heads to try to get them to act a certain way is absolutely absurd.\nBy the way, this is such a bizarre way of looking at the world\u2026\u201dKnowing\u201d is just so important to him\u2026not just having enough of a working knowledge to navigate the world\u2026but TOTAL KNOWLEDGE. Otherwise he feels REALLY insecure. He\u2019s so terrified of NOT knowing something\u2026that he is willing to just pick something and choose to believe it. The sad thing is, this is exactly what people do with their political beliefs and really their beliefs about most th"}, "episode_35": {"date": "2014-11-5", "text": "Posted on November 5, 2014\nEpisode 39 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #039 on Empiricism. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nMaybe the best place to start the show today is to talk about this confusing, moment in time that we have been talking about for about the last 7 or 8 episodes. All of these thinkers that are living around the same time as each other, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz\u2026these philosophers and all the humans that were in the know at the time were living in a very weird place. At this time, there was a giant change in the way that these thinkers viewed themselves as humans in the natural world that created a level of weirdness that was unprecedented. Now this weirdness was largely driven by a couple of different inventions that hadn\u2019t existed before. One was the telescope.\nWith the telescope, for the first time in history we were looking out deep into the vast expanses of space. The more that we looked out there and the more sophisticated these telescopes got, the more information we got and that information categorically reinforced that fact that Earth was very, very small. A speck of dust. And it was far from the center of the universe. As we used these telescopes to gaze deeper and deeper into space, slowly realizing the absolute enormity of it all, we started realizing that this tiny little blue speck that we call Earth might not be as significant as we initially thought.\nNow on the other hand we had the microscope looking at things. This planet may be a tiny little speck in the grand scheme of things, but let\u2019s magnify what we have and see if we can get some insight into what reality is made out of. What these thinkers were finding as they put this stuff under a microscope is that entire worlds existed underneath what we could see with the naked eye. The deeper and deeper that they went and the more of these micro worlds that they found, the more they started to realize just how strange this reality was that that we had no idea existed before our very eyes.\nBut as we\u2019ll find out over the course of this episode\u2026that really is the problem isn\u2019t it. Our eyes. I kind of have mixed feeling about eyes. By the way, I\u2019m not going on a rampage against eyes here. I feel like I need to say a few good things about eyes to balance out the rest of the episode. I want to give equal time. On one hand, eyes are pretty amazing things\u2026they are these completely unique, jelly filled spheres that absorb the light around you and send signals to your brain that creates a map of the world around you so that you can walk around in it safely. Absolutely incredible. I mean, why do we have eyes if not for this reason. And they do that thankless job pretty darn well. You can see perfectly well enough to do anything that you need to do to survive on this planet. You can see well enough to know whether this is a poisonous mushroom or a harmless one, you can see well enough to not get trampled by a buffalo, you can see well enough to determine whether member of your species are attractive or not. This is what eyes were designed for and they do it well.\nOn the other hand, that\u2019s not the only thing we use eyes for now is it. For example, if we wanted to, say, understand the nature of matter itself or gain certainty about the fabric of reality, now the eyes aren\u2019t so incredible anymore. In fact, if you think about it, they are absolute garbage. These very real limitations of our senses plagued these 17th century philosophers tremendously. Before we go deeper into that I want to ask a question that will set the stage. This is a big question. What is reality?\nWhen you ask people this question they usually look at you like they\u2019re confused pretty fast. One common theory would be\u2026Well, reality is what is real. Its what\u2019s right in front of me! It\u2019s what I can see and smell and touch\u2026after all when I think of something that is not reality, or some fantasy world that is less REAL than what I call reality I think of things I think of someone day dreaming, or I think of video games or movies\u2026maybe someone that took a hallucinogenic drug of some sort, to these people these experiences are not reality. Reality is what they interact with consistently. For example, my arm. My arm is not fleeting, coming and going out of my awareness. I see it right there, I can touch it. Therefore, my arm is real.\nBut you see the glaring problem here, right? You are perceiving reality through your eyes. Eyes that were designed to create a map of the world accurate enough for you to eat, sleep, reproduce and survive as long as possible. These eyes weren\u2019t designed to see what reality truly is. This is something we\u2019re all familiar with. We know that the world is made up of trillions of tiny little particles called atoms that are constantly moving\u2026but when you look at a table or a tree or even your arm\u2026you don\u2019t see those atoms moving. Why should you? What is going on at an atomic level is just not that important to you. Being able to see those atoms moving is not going to make you more capable of eating, sleeping, reproducing or surviving, so why would your eyes be designed to see that? But then again, in reality they ARE moving.\nJust to illustrate how extreme this can get, each of those atoms that are constantly moving around are made up of 99.9% empty space. Just consider for a second that the world you are walking around in that your eyes are telling you is made of stationary, completely solid objects is actually made up at a micro level of 99.9% empty space and that .1% is constantly moving. Again the point is: human eyes create a map of the world that is accurate enough, but far from actual reality.\nWe use special tools and instruments, like a microscope and a telescope to augment our sense experiences to be able to get a more accurate view of that actual reality. But what is actual reality? Do our flawed senses prevent us from ever truly experiencing it? This is the weird place that these thinkers like Descartes, Locke and Leibniz found themselves in. Just think about the task these guys had ahead of them. Before their time period we used something very different to arrive at certainty about what caused things to happen in the natural world. We thought we had it all figured out. We grew complacent. Turns out Aristotle may not have known everything. Turns out some dude in a sand dune channeling God wasn\u2019t the best way to arrive at absolute certainty. So when these thinkers were faced with the task of finding a science that could arrive at understanding about causes in the natural world, they really took the task seriously.\nThey didn\u2019t want to end up where we were before. They didn\u2019t know if it was possible, but they wanted to try to find some system that we could use to arrive at ABSOLUTE certainty about things. One of the biggest problems they were running into is that no matter how flawless the system was, it still was ultimately going to be implemented by humans. Humans that are biased and make mistakes, but more importantly humans that are looking at the results of the experiments through flawed senses from the get go.\nIts funny, if you think about the modern religion vs science debate as a play then one commonly recurring character is the person that says where\u2019s the evidence? There are a lot of people in modern times that highly value empirical data. When someone gives one of these transcendent religious experiences\u2026you know someone says that they were sitting in their front room and Jesus came down through the ceiling and told them he is the son of God and that he needs to stop being so mean to his neighbors and that he needs to start going to church. They hook this guy up to an MRI machine and see that he truly believes what he is saying\u2026There\u2019s a certain type of evidence based thinker in modern times that would say\u2026no I don\u2019t think that happened. His eyes were messing up\u2026he drank some pine sol right before that happened his senses were playing tricks on him. And that same person you could ask them why they don\u2019t believe in God and they would say\u2026well, where is he? I\u2019ve never seen the guy with my eyes! I\u2019ve never heard the guy speak to me! If only I could have that experience then I would know for sure that he exists.\nLet\u2019s have some respect for the task that these thinkers put themselves through. These people weren\u2019t satisfied with the way that science was being done and in many ways they wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with the way science is done today. After all, science isn\u2019t perfect right? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not railing against science, it may be better than blindly believing something that seems to be reasonable to you, but science is far from perfect if you are trying to be absolutely certain. Now we\u2019re going to talk about some of the inherent flaws with what we call science, but I want to be sure we understand the fact that these thinkers didn\u2019t know whether it was possible, didn\u2019t know whether they would ever arrive at certainty, but they were trying to access TRUE reality, whatever matter or physical reality is on the other side of this crude map of the world that our eyes create. It obviously was very different in reality than how we perceive it and they wanted to access it. This problem is commonly referred to in philosophy as the veil of perception.\nNow we\u2019re going to come back to that, but let\u2019s talk about some of the inherent problems that these thinkers were addressing when trying to use science to arrive at certainty.\nThink back to the earliest of humans. They found themselves existing within this natural world. They looked around them and they saw stuff happening. Lightning comes down from the clouds, your female counterpart spontaneously has a baby, you eat old meat and you feel terrible for a few weeks\u2026stuff is happening all the time and understanding what causes those things to happen can give you a real edge when it comes to survival. Go back far enough and humans were almost entirely ignorant to what caused things to happen in the natural world, and they wanted to find some way to organize this stuff with some level of confidence that they were correct. When we do science, this is what we\u2019re trying to do, we\u2019re just much further along than earlier humans were. We\u2019re ultimately trying to arrive at certain truth to make sense of this natural world.\nLet\u2019s talk about two different ways of trying to arrive at the truth, or at least to convince some entity that something is true or not. Let\u2019s talk about induction vs deduction.\nDeduction is the process of starting with something that you think is true, then you apply that truth to some specific individual case. That individual case reinforces it and something is deemed to be true. For example, a police officer shows up at a traffic accident and sees certain things. He sees glass on the ground over here, he sees the positioning of the cars, he sees skid marks leading to this section of the road, etc. From this scene of the accident and certain \u201ctruths\u201d that he holds after his long career of seeing accident scenes\u2026he deduces what happened. This may be an effective way of finding out what happened at an intersection but it runs into problems when trying to arrive at certainty.\nThe other way of doing this is Induction. Induction is the way that we use in modern science. Induction is inferring a general truth based on individual experiments or cases or previously established general truths. For example, if you wanted to arrive at the truth about the moisture present in dogs noses, Do all dogs have wet noses? how would we go about finding that out? Well, I could start with one experiment\u2026I turn and look at my dog Charlie and touch his nose and see that it is wet. So far, all dogs have wet noses. I could spend years of my life going door to door, conducting thousands of experiments checking to see if every dog in the city of Seattle has a wet nose. Let\u2019s say they all do, can we conclude for certain that all dogs have wet noses? Now, no one has the time or the patience to go around and check every single dog in the world to see if it has a wet nose, but even if we did could we use induction and say now that all dogs have wet noses? In modern science, we would. I mean, for all intents and purposes we\u2019re pretty sure all dogs have wet noses, but are we certain of that? How do we know the same laws of nature apply on mars or Jupiter or some other distant planet where dogs don\u2019t have wet noses, how can we be sure the next dog that is born on this planet wont be the exception to the rule and throw a monkey wrench in everything?\nTo us this may not be a big deal. There is a lot of useful stuff you can do with the conclusion that all dogs have wet noses and barring that super unlikely chance it is proven wrong one day, we can. But to someone trying to develop a system to arrive at certainty, this is a huge problem. The way we do science now can never be trusted to arrive at certainty, because we are limited to the things we have on this planet to experiment on. These thinkers weren\u2019t doubting whether this way of doing things might eventually lead us to things that were true, they didn\u2019t doubt whether this way is better than any other way we\u2019ve done it in the past, but it is far from certainty about things and that was what they were aiming for.\nThe way that I like to think about this age of empiricism is that no matter how good a system is we are ultimately limited to it being executed by a human existing on planet earth. Those are huge handicaps when it comes to arriving at truth, again the eyes and ears and nose are great at doing what they were designed to do, but they\u2019re absolutely terrible tools if you\u2019re trying to understand the nature of reality with certainty. They just aren\u2019t the right tools for the job. If you are given a wrench and someone wants you to tighten up some bolts, it is going to work perfectly, but if they ask you to use the wrench to saw through a piece of wood, it\u2019s gonna get ugly real fast. You might still be able to do it eventually, but it is going to be a longer, less clean process than if you had a saw.\nThe limitations caused by our senses when it comes to arriving at certainty was something that deeply concerned these thinkers in the 17th century. This is why Leibniz and his ideas about Truths of necessity vs Truths of fact were so awesome. Science helps us arrive at truths of fact, but they are far from certain. Is certainty possible when we talk about truths of necessity? where the terms themselves make specific qualities certain? Remember, all bachelors are unmarried\u2026can that be said to be something we know for certain?\nThese thinkers were all really interested in these problems and they all came up with different approaches to try to address them. One of these approaches that became very important in philosophy was by Mr. John Locke. He was an absolute genius if you haven\u2019t already thought that yourself\u2026laid the foundations for the constitution, his whole Tabula Rasa or Blank Slate theory, but also something we touched on very briefly before was his idea of Primary vs Secondary qualities of things.\nWhat he is trying to address here is what lies beyond the veil of perception. Whenever we use these flawed senses to look out into the world and see something or smell something or hear something, whatever that thing is that we\u2019re looking at, Locke says that it has primary and secondary qualities. Let me give an example.\nI am sitting here at a desk and I see my wife\u2019s phone sitting on the desk right in front of me. It has a green phone case on it.\n\nWhen I look at that iPhone sitting on the table there are certain things I can think I know about it based on what my senses are telling me. There seems to be one iPhone\u2026not two or three\u2026uh it seems to be sitting still\u2026it seems to be smooth\u2026not rough like concrete or something\u2026it seems to be about the thickness and size of a checkbook\u2026it seems to be rectangular. Now, all of these things to John Locke can be considered Primary qualities of the iPhone. Me looking at the iPhone and saying that it is green, or me picking it up and smelling it or me hearing it ring or, hopefully not, me eating the phone and describing to you guys what it tastes like, these can be seen as secondary qualities.\nThis is a really good question to ask yourself. When you see something like a green iPhone, what is that green-ness? Does that green-ness exist inside of the matter that makes up the iPhone is there something in it that is green? or is it the way your eye draws the world when you perceive some interaction between light and some specific arrangement of what that matter is underneath the veil of perception?\nAs we talked about before, Locke was a huge proponent of Boyle and his idea that the real fabric of reality are these tiny colorless, tasteless, soundless, odorless corpuscles of matter. The arrangement of these explain the primary qualities of something. I see the iPhone as rectangular because there is some rectangular arrangement of these corpuscles. On the other hand, when I experience it being green, this isn\u2019t because the corpuscles themselves are green, its because of some arrangement of them interacting with light and my eyes.\nBecause all of these secondary qualities that Locke talks about are explainable only by referring to primary qualities, secondary qualities cant be said to be part of that reality behind the veil of perception. He gives an example where he talks about a knife made out of steel. If someone comes up to you and stabs you with a knife and you feel pain, you wouldn\u2019t say that it was \u201cpain\u201d that was cooped up inside of the knife that caused you pain. No, it was the steel that the knife is made out of interacting with your senses.\nWell, this all brings us to question Berkeley famously offered a solution to. Berkeley was very similar to Leibniz in that he was a religious guy\u2026in fact he was made into a bishop so he is sometimes referred to as bishop Berkeley\u2026and he is faced with the problem of reconciling the new mechanistic way of viewing the universe with the notion of god. This whole situation really is like a large corporation hired a team of corporate downsizers that come in and look at how everything operates and how everyone does their job and they check to see who is important and look for people to eliminate to cut costs. and it\u2019s like Berkeley and Leibniz are people that are trying to convince these people that God really is important around the office.\nBerkeley really wants god to be required in his view of the universe. So he starts from this premise and he arrives at an idea that would spark a chain of ideas that would change the philosophical world. This idea may not seem revolutionary at first, but trust me it really shook things up and since we\u2019ve spent the entire show today talking about empiricism and the problems that come up when trying to arrive at certainty, you guys more than most people that study philosophy are going to understand why Berkeley suggests what he does.\nThe extended explanation of this is going to have to wait until next episode, but let me give you the basic idea so that you have something awesome to think about this week. If we have this pesky veil of perception that we have to deal with\u2026if there is this \u201cworld as it truly is\u201d underneath this flawed map of reality\u2026this idea in our minds of what reality is created by our senses, then we never directly experience that true reality underneath. All we ever experience is that IDEA of reality. So instead of trying to explain and get a hold of what lies beneath those ideas, why do we even assume that something exists underneath the ideas we perceive. Isn\u2019t it more reasonable to conclude that only the ideas themselves exist? Or that to be\u2026is to be perceived. Look forward to getting deep into this next time on Philosophize This!\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_36": {"date": "2014-11-10", "text": "Posted on November 10, 2014\nEpisode 42 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #042 on Optimism. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nLet\u2019s all start the show today by asking ourselves a very revealing question: Am I an optimist? No\u2026not me. I\u2019m not asking you guys if I\u2019m an optimist. Let\u2019s think about ourselves for a second. When you go about your life and things happen to you good or bad\u2026do you think about the future optimistically or pessimistically?\nThere\u2019s kind of a bizarre stigma attached to being a pessimist\u2026do you guys know what I\u2019m talking about? Like, being a pessimist\u2026when you\u2019re running in certain circles you just are NOT supposed to be a pessimist\u2026it\u2019s one of the worst things you could ever be. Heaven forbid someone puts a glass of water on the table in front of you\u2026\u201dWhat do you mean it\u2019s half empty! You have water! It\u2019s the miracle substance of life!\u201d\nMaybe the best way to get to the bottom of pessimism is just to look at what most of the time causes people to be pessimists. And there\u2019s a surprising amount of work done on this subject. I mean, you\u2019d think there is just some arbitrary thing that happens throughout our childhood\u2026some conditioning that causes you to expect that everything is going to work out for the best, or to expect that these potential bad things will probably come to fruition\u2026but people have dug a little deeper.\nThere\u2019s a lot of different ways that people validate their pessimism\u2026.it seems very clear there is a strong contingency of people that claim that they are pessimistic because they just have way too much life experience and knowledge to ever expect things to work out for the best. These people don\u2019t even want to call themselves pessimists\u2026they say I\u2019m a REALIST. Look, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t WANT things to work out for the best\u2026it\u2019s that I\u2019ve been around the block a couple times and I\u2019m not going to fill my head with starry eyed fantasies about things working out for the best. Bad things happen, and if you don\u2019t expect them you are just setting yourself up for failure after failure after failure.\nMany of these people are cynics\u2026they knock on optimists for being these naive children with delusions of grandeur\u2026saying that through their blind optimism they are setting themselves up for a lifetime of dealing with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\u2026What\u2019s really interesting to consider is that many of the pessimists end up falling into this same trap\u2026they become so cynical and so negative about how the world is going to treat them that they end up growing apathetic\u2026they end up just throwing their hands up in the air\u2026and whenever they hear about any sort of bad thing happening in the world they kind of scoff and say what else is new?\nBut there isn\u2019t just one type of pessimist\u2026lets not only focus on these people. There are many ways that people justify their pessimism. There\u2019s one type of pessimist\u2026I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all met one of these fine, absolutely toxic people really pessimistic attitude about the future for some underlying, self-congratulatory psychological game that their playing with themselves. You know they\u2019ll surround themselves with optimists and when good things happen to them\u2026well they got lucky this time\u2026and when bad things happen\u2026you should\u2019ve listened to me\u2026I told ya so.\nOne of the more interesting theories I\u2019ve read about why people are pessimistic when it comes to their personal views of the world is that we may have all evolved to be pessimists. The idea behind this one is that if two hunter gatherers are walking through the Serengeti and they come across some high grass\u2026one of them says \u201coh there\u2019s probably not a lion in there!\u201d and the other one says \u201cno. I\u2019m staying out here. I think there will be one\u2026\u201d Well, the hunter-gatherers with a predisposition for pessimism didn\u2019t get disemboweled by a lion as frequently\u2026so they lived on to reproduce and fill the gene pool that we come from.\nThere\u2019s this really strange way of thinking that I find is pretty common among your average person that says that the longer you live on this planet\u2026and the more you know about the world around you\u2026the more pessimistic and miserable you have to be as a result of that knowledge. You know they hear the quote ignorance is bliss and in my opinion they mistakenly jump to the conclusion that the only path to bliss is through ignorance and that the more you know the more tortured you are by that knowledge.\nOne thing I\u2019d like to point out as we talk about optimism when it comes to our personal lives is that the only thing you are doing by being an optimist or a pessimist is choosing the lens that you are going to view the world through. What I mean by this is that being an optimist or pessimist doesn\u2019t necessarily change what happens to you in the world. It changes how you perceive it\u2026it might change the number of mental barriers you set up for yourself and that might in turn change how you react to what happens in your life\u2026but being a pessimist doesn\u2019t change how much control you have over the adversity or fortune that is thrown your way living your everyday life.\nYou have zero control over that stuff. As the stoics would say\u2026all of these things are external to you\u2026the only thing YOU have control over is how your mind reacts to these things. Let me give an example\u2026when a company is doing well and hiring a bunch of people and selling tons of product and then the economy tanks\u2026let\u2019s say to stay in business they need to lay off 100 people. Now that 100 people is not made up of one type of person\u2026there are both optimists and pessimists in that group of people. The point is\u2026the people who were pessimistic out of that hundred didn\u2019t prevent this bad thing from happening to them by dwelling on how unfair and volatile the world is for months ahead of time.\nBeing an optimist or a pessimist doesn\u2019t control the future, it just controls how you see the future. Now you could say, well the pessimist in that case EXPECTED to get laid off and therefore probably has other jobs lined up when the optimist is blindsided\u2026.and that is true. But what about the hundred other cases where their pessimism could be destructive? What if the economy was terrible and they just COULDN\u2019T get another job lined up. Their pessimism might ALSO lead them to collect unemployment and wallow in their own filth on the couch for 9 months watching Maury Povich saying, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll EVER get a job\u2026why even try.\nWinston Churchill said, \u201cFor myself I am an optimist \u2013 it does not seem to be much use to be anything else.\u201d\nNow were all faced with the decision everyday to make the choice of whether to be an optimist or a pessimist in our personal lives. You may have been born or conditioned to have a predisposition in one direction or another, but you aren\u2019t sentenced to a lifetime of being either one of them. You can train your brain to perceive the world differently\u2026and what Winston Churchill is alluding to here is that being an Optimist is a USEFUL thing. Not just a nice pipe dream for us to delude ourselves with\u2026not just what stupid people do\u2026no quite the opposite..being an optimist is the ONLY useful proposition to Winston Churchill.\nNow why do you think he said this? Well you could say\u2026whether you think good is going to come or bad is going to come\u2026it doesn\u2019t change what is eventually going to happen, so why put yourself through all the needless duress of focusing on all the potentially negative outcomes? But I think the \u201cusefulness\u201d that Churchill is talking about here actually runs much deeper.\nThere are all kinds of studies that unanimously talk about all of the various benefits there are to being an optimist as opposed to a pessimist. Optimists live longer\u2026they have better immune systems than pessimists\u2026they have lower levels of stress and anxiety. A study that took place over a long period of time found that optimists were 23% less likely to die from heart disease and 55% less likely to succumb to all forms of premature death.\nOptimists make more money across the board\u2026$30,000 more per year than their pessimistic equals. Optimists are significantly happier than pessimists, some studies say that optimists are luckier than pessimists\u2026some say that they are significantly more likely to be in long term, fulfilling relationships.\nWhat im saying is\u2026when it comes to which lens is more useful on a personal level\u2026it seems pretty clear being an optimist has a lot of use outside of just deluding yourself in the short term. Another philosopher that talks about optimism a lot is Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2026he said \u201cWrite it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.\u201d\nThis is the opposite of a quote in the movie Office Space where someone goes hey how are you today? and the guy goes, \u201cEvery single day in my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every day you see me\u2026you see me on the worst day of my life.\u201d\nThink about the opposite of that\u2026if you write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year\u2026then every single day you live on this planet is the greatest day of your life. It is an upward staircase. You seek out every good thing that happens to you as reinforcement of that fact, rather than descending down this dark downward staircase. I mean just think about it\u2026even when a long string of good things happens to a pessimist, they usually spend all their time not appreciating how good they currently have it, but thinking about how all of these good things in their life are just going to inevitably leave them or be destroyed. It\u2019s almost like they never had them in the first place.\nMarcus Aurelius said in his meditations to \u201cDwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.\u201d Now this is coming from Marcus Aurelius! He was a Stoic! The stoics are one of the most famous advocates of premeditated pessimism in the world\u2026you know you should wake up and tell yourself I will be met with idiots and inconsiderate people\u2026I will get cut off in traffic today\u2026that guys WILL steal my parking spot at work\u2026Even someone who strongly advises to hold low expectations about the world has a very clear focus on the beauty and positivity in the world rather than things that would be needlessly destructive.\nWell there was another philosopher that had a famous quote about optimism\u2026his name was Voltaire and it went: Optimism is the madness of insisting all is well when we are miserable.\nWhat are you talking about Voltaire? The glass is half full! No\u2026we shouldn\u2019t get down on Voltaire here\u2026and we should all be very mindful not to disagree with something we don\u2019t fully understand yet. Because the optimism Voltaire is talking about\u2026the optimism that he is railing against in this quote is in a very different context than what we\u2019ve been talking about so far in this episode. By exploring the difference between these two uses of optimism\u2026by exploring Voltaire\u2019s famous rebuttal to Leibniz called the Candide, I think by the end of the episode we are all going to look at the world a little differently.\nLet\u2019s consider something for a second\u2026do you guys think there is one correct way for all humans to look at the world at all times? What I mean by that is you may think that being an optimist is the only useful, or logical way to go about things in your personal life living in the 21st century in modern America, but does that apply to every situation any entity might find itself in? For example, what if you\u2019re a company in an extremely competitive market where dozens of businesses are trying to steal your market share and out innovate you and drive you out of business\u2026is thinking \u201ceverything works out for the best\u201d the best attitude?\nThe bigger question here is: When you look at the U.S. government\u2026or the government of whatever country you come from\u2026do you vote for the government to act based on the same set of behaviors that you live your personal life by? For example, in your personal life you may be a fiscal conservative\u2026you don\u2019t take out a bunch of credit cards to make the down payment on a Ferrari that you cant afford the maintenance on\u2026and have no idea how you\u2019re going to pay for it\u2026but you may think it is INHUMAN for the government to not use taxpayer funded subsidies to promote a giant unfunded future taxpayer liability that we have no way of paying for yet.\nNow I\u2019m not making an argument for fiscal conservatism here, but what I want to point out is that often times the set of behaviors we live our personal lives by is very different than the set of behaviors we want the government to use when acting on our behalf. And what I\u2019d like to ask all of you right now is: Do you want your government to be optimistic about the possibility of terrorist attacks? Do you want your government to be optimistic about the future of the economy\u2026ah one of these days we\u2019ll find a way!\u201d Do you want the human species to be optimistic about climate change?\nBut it\u2019s funny\u2026if we looked at those three things when it comes to our personal life\u2026why shouldn\u2019t you be optimistic? What you want to run around in fear of being attacked by terrorists? The point here is to explore the idea that optimism may be excellent in certain contexts\u2026IE our personal lives\u2026and not the best way of doing things in other contexts.\nWhen Voltaire said the words that optimism is the madness of insisting that all is well when we are miserable\u2026he was talking about philosophical optimism. He was talking about optimism on a species wide scale.\nHe was responding to Leibniz. remember, Leibniz famously said that we exist in the best of all possible worlds. That god didn\u2019t sit up in the heavens and decide to create the second best of all possible worlds\u2026or the third best\u2026no he created the BEST of all possible worlds. So because of that, Leibniz argued, everything thing that happens is for the best. Terrorist attacks\u2026economic collapses\u2026the greenhouse effect\u2026all of these things are God\u2019s will\u2026and while we may not understand WHY they happen at the time with our feeble human intellects\u2026we can rest assured that they are probably damage control or necessary for future evils to not occur. No matter how bad things may SEEM\u2026relax guys\u2026God maintains this as the best of all possible worlds.\nVoltaire was in a pretty dark place in the year 1755. The love of his life had just died. The people he detested the most were in their ascendancy. And to top it off one of the most catastrophic earthquakes in human history hit Lisbon in the kingdom of Portugal\u2026to history it would become known as the great Lisbon earthquake. The death, horror and destruction witnessed by people on the ground and cataloged by Voltaire was beyond justification. This was long before any sort of earthquake construction code had been enacted and the death and cleanup that came with a natural event like this would\u2019ve been appalling to even the most seasoned of warriors back then.\nVoltaire writes a poem that aims to serve a few different purposes, but two of the major ones was to convey to people living far away the destruction that took place, but also to attack what he thought was the tremendously naive view that all is well! we are living in the best of all possible worlds! After all, how could anyone think that could be the case when things like this are happening? The world is better off when these horrific events occur? Here is an excerpt from the poem:\n\nUnlucky mortals! O deplorable earth!\np.242\n\nHe says in another section:\n\n\u2018If it be true,\u2019 they said, \u2018that whatever is, is right, it follows that human nature is not fallen.\nIf the order of things requires that everything should be as it is, then human nature has not been corrupted, and consequently as no need for a Redeemer.\nif the miseries of individuals are merely the by-product of this general and necessary order,\nthen we are nothing more than cogs which serve to keep the great machine in motion; we are no more precious in the eyes of God than the animals by which we are devoured.\u2019\n\nWell, Voltaire ruffles a lot of feathers with this poem and it gains him a considerable amount of notoriety. There are a lot of people that respond, but historians of philosophy all agree that the most notable of all of these was from a guy we will be covering in detail soon on the podcast, Jean Jacques Rousseau. His argument basically goes like this\u2026The reason such horror can be inflicted by an earthquake that God allows to exist on the planet is because we aren\u2019t following God\u2019s intentions. God never intended for anyone to live in cities\u2026crammed together like sardines! In fact, cities exemplify all the vice and excess that goes against God! God wanted people to live in the countryside! When there\u2019s an earthquake in the country, no one dies! He compares Voltaire to someone that built his home at the bottom of the ocean and then yells at God for allowing him to drown! We DO live in the best of all possible worlds.\nWhat may have otherwise been left to a stinging poem by Voltaire was magnified by this response. Rousseau set Voltaire into a frenzy. What he wrote in response was one of, if not his most influential work\u2026the Candide. Voltaire decides to destroy this foolish optimism that was originally laid out by Leibniz\u2026and there are so many different interpretations of what was happening\u2026there are even people that think Voltaire wasn\u2019t responding to Leibniz at all but really the authority of the church at the time\u2026regardless it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026this work known as the Candide was a ruthless rebuttal to the idea that we live in the best of all possible worlds.\nThe title Candide comes from the main character. The book starts out with Candide being a student to a respected scholar named Pangloss\u2026who believes that we live in the best of all possible worlds. He teaches him all about it and Candide obliges him. Candide starts getting some feelings\u2026he is caught kissing the Baron\u2019s daughter and he is expelled. Along his travels he comes across terribly bloody battles and all kinds of other things that almost get him killed and eventually he arrives in Holland and he comes across this disheveled mangled beggar who he recognizes is Pangloss!\nWhat happened Pangloss? Well it turns out an army came\u2026killed his family messed him up and now here he is\u2026and beggar on the streets\u2026but he still believes he is living in the best of all possible worlds! From here it doesn\u2019t get any better\u2026Candide, Pangloss and several other of their miscreant friends that they meet along the way are tortured, put to death, enslaved, raped, beaten\u2026.the whole book catalogs a really depressing sequence of events that ironically ends with them all living on a farm together and despite everything that happens\u2026Pangloss still believes he is living in the best of all possible worlds.\nThe whole story is chaos with the central point of it to make certain observations about the human species\u2026the key one is how ridiculous Pangloss\u2019s optimism is in the face of all these things that are wrong with the world. Are we truly living in the BEST of all possible worlds?\nLet me sum up Voltaire\u2019s main points in the Candide. When it comes to the human species looking at all of these bad things optimistically, we really are shooting ourselves in the foot. Sure, it may make us FEEL great to say that no matter what happens\u2026no matter how bad things get\u2026whatever happened is ultimately for the best, but is what makes us FEEL better necessarily the best thing for humanity?\nVoltaire says\u2026if we live in the best of all possible worlds\u2026and everything that happens is ultimately for the best\u2026then anything that happens is the best thing that could ever happen! So if you believe that, why even try? Why should we try to prevent terrorist attacks, or enact policy that creates jobs, or try to understand what causes climate change if ultimately anything that happens is the best thing that could ever happen and it is maintained by God?\nWhy even try to limit human suffering\u2026if any subsequent human suffering is God\u2019s will and therefore the best thing that could ever happen? See, Voltaire was a deist at this point in his life\u2026he doesn\u2019t think that God created all of this so that he could grant wishes for this one species of humanoids. He uses an incredible metaphor to talk about how we should truly be viewing ourselves when we grow up and move away from these other superstitions. He compares the universe to a ship that was built for the King of Egypt.\nHe says that God is like the King of Egypt\u2026he built this ship\u2026and we as humans are like rats in the lower deck of the ship drowning in puddles or starving to death. Yes, we are a part of God\u2019s creation, God may even be aware of our existence\u2026but he didn\u2019t create the ship so that rats could scurry around and flourish in the lower decks. No he built the ship for some greater purpose\u2026sailing him around the Mediterranean\u2026a purpose the rats would never be able to fully comprehend. When these rats get stuck in a puddle underneath\u2026Is the King of Egypt concerned about that? Is the King of Egypt bothering himself with running around SAVING every rat, or maintaining that the rats exist in the Best of all possible decks of the ship? No the rat shouldn\u2019t have fallen into the puddle\u2026sorry. King of Egypt doesn\u2019t even think about it.\nWhat Voltaire is getting at here is that if we were giving advice to the rats\u2026would we tell them that the King of Egypt is going to insure that everything works out for the best? No\u2026the amount of rat suffering on his ship isn\u2019t even close to his number one priority\u2026in the same way that fruit fly suffering or cow suffering isn\u2019t the main thing he is concerned with. If we were giving advice to the rats\u2026we would tell them\u2026look if you want to limit the amount of rat suffering\u2026YOU GUYS have to do something about it. Build a bridge over that puddle so rats don\u2019t fall in\u2026find a way to secure more food for yourselves so you don\u2019t starve!\nJust like the rats\u2026if we want to limit the suffering of other humans\u2026the WORST thing we can do is sit around and be complacent\u2026being optimistic about the fact that anything that happens is for the best! Should we be complacent about terrorist attacks? Saying that if God allows them\u2026then they are for the best? No! Voltaire would say we should do something about it. Should we be complacent about the effects of climate change? Saying that God will regulate the temperature if things ever get too steamy? No! Voltaire would say we should learn as much as we can about it.\nTo Voltaire, limiting human suffering is OUR responsibility. And sitting around saying that everything that happens is for the best breeds complacency. WE need to be taking action, not assuming that human suffering is the metric that God uses to determine what the best of all possible worlds is.\nSo it\u2019s fascinating to me that when it comes to our personal lives, Optimism seems like the clear way to go, but when it comes to the government and the future of the human species, we want them to be as pessimistic and worrisome as possible. Maybe that\u2019s one of the benefits of being a part of an organized, governed society is that by outsourcing all of that pessimism and worry to the government to worry about, it allows for us to live healthier, richer, happier, less worry-filled lives. The question is\u2026are you taking advantage of it fully?\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_37": {"date": "2014-11-20", "text": "Posted on November 20, 2014\nEpisode 43 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #043 on Tolerance. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe episode today is kind of a weird one\u2026I want to talk about really take a close look at why tolerance was so important to Voltaire and the enlightenment thinkers\u2026and hopefully by the end of the show we can understand ourselves a little better and why we treat people the way that we do.\n\n> What comes to your mind when I say the word tolerance? What comes to your mind when you think about how tolerant you are towards the beliefs of other people\u2026and what are you willing to do in the name of ending intolerance in the world around you? Keep these questions in mind.\n\n> Now I\u2019m about to read you a story and the only thing I ask of you today is to make a mental note of how you feel about the actions of the woman in the story. Remember how you feel in your stomach about what she does because after looking at tolerance from several different angles I\u2019m going to ask you to think about the story again. Try to identify any changes in the way you view the story after thinking about intolerance. If there are zero changes in the way you think about it\u2026you\u2019re either a super genius or my show is terrible.\n\n>\n\n> bus driver story\n\n> Now let\u2019s break down this story a bit. For all of you listening at home, there\u2019s probably some point in this story where you agreed with the driver\u2019s actions. The problem is, there are different layers to the story\u2026she keeps vamping up what she is willing to do in the name of her beliefs\u2026and as we peel back these layers, fewer and fewer people agree with what she did to the point where only \u2026crazed fanatics would agree with what she did. Let\u2019s look at these layers.\n\n> She starts out at the beginning just overhearing a conversation that\u2019s going on. The girl says something she doesn\u2019t agree with and the bus driver is listening to it. There is a certain percentage of people listening to this show that would react this way\u2026they would hear a belief that somebody else holds and they would not say anything. Why is it any of my business what this person believes? I\u2019m going to stay out of this.\n\n> The second layer is when the lady pulls out her soapbox and begins proselytizing her and the rest of the bus. Yes, the public flogging may have been going a little too far\u2026this was an extreme variant of this layer of the intolerance onion so to speak, but there is a certain percentage of people listening to this that when they hear someone say a belief that they think could potentially hurt themselves or others they feel a sense of obligation to change that person\u2019s mind, if for no other reason then out of respect to future victims.\n\n> The third layer is when the lady decides to double back and invite her and her sister BACK up onto the bus and go to the\u2026 extent of her capacity to change their beliefs about gay marriage and abortion. There is a percentage of people listening to this right now that assigns themselves the obligation to do EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER to CHANGE someones mind about something.\n\n> Now obviously the fourth layer is our directors cut ending that\u2019s a tactic that not many people listening to this show are going to use, but you don\u2019t have to look much further than the 5 o clock news each night to see that there are people willing to kill other people simply because they don\u2019t believe what they believe and they feel the best solution is to eradicate any opposing viewpoint from planet earth.\n\n> Now, we all agreed with the bus drivers decisions up until a certain point in the story\u2026which point was it for you? When did she cross the line? The irony here, and the deeper question that is underneath this story is a famous question in philosophy: If you consider yourself to be a tolerant person, how intolerant should you be of the intolerant? I mean think about it\u2026the reason this bus driver decided to do anything is because she heard the girl proudly supporting intolerant beliefs. So\u2026her reaction to that is to call her names\u2026threaten to eat her alive\u2026silence her: her fought intolerance with intolerance.\n\n> If tolerance is a virtue that you strive to emulate, what, if any, obligations do you have when it comes to combating intolerance that you hear other people spewing? One thing I want to make clear right now, a mistake that a lot of people make when they think about intolerance is that if you\u2019re a tolerant person, that doesn\u2019t mean that you never disagree with anyone. Tolerance isn\u2019t saying that everyone is right and no one is wrong\u2026Tolerance is accepting that other beliefs exist and not taking action to silence or condemn people that disagree with you. And that\u2019s a big difference from just disagreeing with someone.\n\n> Look, if you live in a first world country in today\u2019s world\u2026congratulations\u2026you live in one of the most tolerant societies to ever exist. Just in my everyday life, I don\u2019t see many people taking to the streets\u2026championing the cause of intolerance. I don\u2019t see many people walking around holding signs proud of how unaccepting they are of other beliefs that aren\u2019t their own\u2026it\u2019s just not how we do things in today\u2019s day and age. I mean, the fact that people like the Westboro Baptist Church are wack-jobs worthy of putting on the news just goes to show you how rare that kind of behavior is. Maybe the best way to understand how important tolerance was to the enlightenment thinkers is to give a little bit of historical context.\n\n> In modern times, we all fancy ourselves extremely tolerant people. Especially the type of people that listen to this show\u2026You know\u2026I don\u2019t care what race, culture or creed you are\u2026I don\u2019t have a problem with it\u2026do whatever you want! This is widely held to be a very admirable and respectable way of viewing other people in the world. But unfortunately for the rest of human history it hasn\u2019t always been this way. Voltaire was living during a time period where being tolerant was seen as the opposite\u2026it was seen as cowardice. Being ambivalent about the strongly held religious convictions of all the other people was seen as laziness.\n\n> And there was a long history of this\u2026there was a long dialogue within the church about\u2026 just how much responsibility the average person had over the eternal fate of their neighbors or friends. St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas\u2026a few other people contributed\u2026but these people systematically made religious intolerance into a virtue\u2026and if you\u2019re confused about how they could ever sell something like that to the public\u2026i mean how could you ever convince the average person that they need to be unaccepting of the religious beliefs of their friends\u2026let me explain where they\u2019re coming from\u2026because it\u2019s not that crazy:\n\n> Their thinking was: could you ever see yourself passively sitting on the sidelines as your neighbors or friends burned to death in a house fire\u2026no if you heard them screaming in there and there was something you could do to save them\u2026wouldn\u2019t you at least try? So, if that\u2019s true..they argued\u2026how could you ever justify sitting on the sidelines watching your neighbors and friends get condemned to the eternal house fire. The house fire to end all house fires\u2026Satan\u2019s Cabana\u2026Hell whatever you wanna call it.\n\n> During the time before Voltaire when people mostly lived under monarch rule\u2026you would never sit idly and watch your friend speak out or organize against the king. So, if that\u2019s true, why would you sit idly and watch them speak out against the king of all kings? You can see where they\u2019re coming from. I mean, if you truly believe that your friend is going to be sentenced to billions of years of torture for not having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head at birth\u2026why would you just sit around doing nothing? By the way\u2026that was a widely held belief back then and it\u2019s no different than the sorts of arbitrary rituals that religious leaders say condemn you to hell in today\u2019s world.\n\n> The point of this is to illustrate just how different the world was back during these times. We see the Westboro Baptist Church parading around in the streets today and we are disgusted\u2026but just a few short centuries ago\u2026what they were doing would\u2019ve been seen as an incredibly selfless virtuous act\u2026they are sacrificing all kinds of worldly pleasures in the name of showing their friends and neighbors the errors of their ways. Saving them from eternal damnation. Voltaire and the rest of the enlightenment thinkers had a HUGE task on their hands. I mean imagine if of western Europe was populated by members of the Westboro Baptist church. First off\u2026if were living in that world\u2026good luck going down to the craft store and getting a neon colored poster board\u2026poster board would be like getting a loaf of bread in WW2\u2026.you could make a lot of money investing in poster board. But what sort of magical intervention would it take to change the way that they viewed intolerance towards other beliefs? Intolerance is a self-sustaining thing\u2026and tolerance really is the opposite.\n\n> What we\u2019re talking about here is a very important and very interesting paradox in philosophy known as the paradox of tolerance. Lots of commentary on it. It really reminds me of something we\u2019ve already talked about on the show before\u2026Protagoras in ancient Greece\u2026the sophist\u2026he has the famous beginning to his Refutations that man is the measure of all things\u2026that there is no good or bad but man makes it so\u2026there is no absolute good or bad or just or unjust\u2026only what individual societies and people deem to be just or unjust. Now the obvious contradiction here is that if everyone is right regardless of what they say\u2026then what about the guy that says that HE is right and everyone else is wrong? Either he is wrong\u2026or Protagoras is wrong.\n\n> Now Protagoras\u2019s position is known as relativism\u2026and although it\u2019s not the same as tolerance\u2026tolerance runs into a similar problem when taken to the extreme. There was a famous scientist and philosopher in the 20th century that we will certainly be talking about named Karl Popper that I think does a really good job at shining a lantern on the inherent problem that arises if we simplify things down to TOLERANCE IS GOOD\u2026INTOLERANCE IS BAD\u2026is it really that simple? He would say no:\n\n> \u201cunlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u201d\n\n> So think about what Karl Popper is saying here\u2026if all the governments of the world had a summit and decided from this day forward we\u2019re all going to be tolerant of any set of beliefs regardless of what they are\u2026then that eventually destines tolerance to be destroyed\u2026.because if the tolerant are always tolerant towards people who are intolerant\u2026then eventually the intolerant gain followers and are INTOLERANT towards the people who are tolerant\u2026who will sit by and be accepting on the sidelines as the intolerant continue to gain power and eliminate the tolerant.\n\n> The important thing to consider here is even though you may strive to be as tolerant a person as possible\u2026is absolute tolerance REALLY what you\u2019re going for as an individual? Is tolerance taken to an extreme\u2026really what we should be striving for as a society? I would argue that every single person listening to this is actually much more intolerant than they realize. I would argue that whether you realize it or not\u2026there are hundreds of sets of beliefs that you work towards eliminating every single day whenever you clock in at your job.\n\n> There are people out in the world\u2026right now\u2026that hold a strong belief that killing people is not a bad thing to do. That murder is OK. Are you tolerant of their beliefs?\n\n> There are people out there right now that believe that molesting children is perfectly OK. Are you tolerant of THEIR beliefs?\n\n> In fact, what are laws and rules other than just a collectively agreed upon set of intolerances? Don\u2019t we all actively pay into a system that is designed to prevent certain the beliefs of certain people? We do! This is a tyranny of the majority! There are so many people that agree that murderers, child molesters and stop sign runners should not be able to exercise their beliefs that we have created a society where if they DO wantonly kill someone walking down the street \u2026we throw them in a cell for the rest of their life. THAT is intolerance\u2026plain and simple. Now I\u2019m not saying we should allow rapists and murderers to walk the streets\u2026but let\u2019s call it what it is. For every law that you agree with, you are intolerant of a belief.\n\n> The point of this is that it\u2019s not as cut and dry as saying that TOLERANCE IS GOOD INTOLERANCE IS BAD. You shouldn\u2019t WANT to be tolerant sometimes\u2026intolerance can be a GREAT thing sometimes. And PURE TOLERANCE inevitably leads to the downfall of tolerance as Karl Popper pointed out. So if we can\u2019t hover around these extremes\u2026we\u2019re all presented with a very difficult choice: what criteria do you use to determine how tolerant you\u2019re going to be?\n\n> Have you guys ever known someone like this\u2026or just imagine a person that walks around and assigns themselves the task of policing the beliefs of everyone that disagrees with them about anything. Imagine how miserable that life would be\u2026someone with no filter\u2026they NEVER pick their battles. Not just religious or cultural beliefs\u2026but down to the basic beliefs. Like they\u2019re a fan of Hot Pockets\u2026and they see someone in the break room eating Lean Pockets. You know\u2026you really shouldn\u2019t eat Lean Pockets\u2026they taste way worse than Hot Pockets and Hot pockets have more calories and they\u2019re the same price as Lean Pockets\u2026you should really just eat half a hot pocket instead of a full lean pocket\u2026\n\n> How maddening would that existence be? No one listening would advocate going around spending your entire life trying to change people\u2019s minds about stuff like that\u2026so what criteria do we use to determine when to step in and try to enforce laws against opposing viewpoints?\n\n> There\u2019s something I said in the belief episode about every belief that we hold that is actually very relevant here. Every belief we hold is a leap of faith..but not all leaps of faith are created equal. I think one of the main things that we use to distinguish between all these leaps of faith are how much they hurt ourselves and other people around us.\n\n> Most people if they were to answer this would say that I don\u2019t have a problem with opposing beliefs until they start to hurt other people. You know\u2026your right to swing your fist ends at the other guy\u2019s nose. Do whatever you want as long as your beliefs don\u2019t hurt me or anyone else.\n\n> You know\u2026most Christians in today\u2019s world wouldn\u2019t want to outlaw Atheism\u2026they don\u2019t think you should be killed or locked in prison for not believing in God\u2026after all if the Atheist is wrong about it\u2026the only person they\u2019re really hurting is themselves.\n\n> In that same way\u2026most Atheists don\u2019t have a problem with several modern denominations of Christianity\u2026because they don\u2019t evangelize\u2026they don\u2019t nail people to a wooden X if they disagree with them\u2026in the long run they are ultimately only hurting themselves if they are wrong\u2026why would we outlaw that?\n\n> Pure intolerance is a fascist dictatorship and pure tolerance is a lawless anarchy. Now what Voltaire is trying to do with the power of the pen is move away from the old ideas of intolerance being a virtue and usher in a world of religious tolerance on a government level. But although he\u2019s focusing on the benefits of tolerance when it comes to maintaining order in a state\u2026the message is also very interesting to think about when it comes to how we treat people in our personal lives\u2026especially considering that we our government is so connected to the opinion of the masses. I mean think about it\u2026we live in a representative republic. Our lawmakers and laws\u2026our collectively agreed upon set of intolerances are chosen by tyranny of the majority.\n\n> Like just imagine if 99% of the U.S. population thought that gay marriage was not only wrong\u2026but should be outlawed. They would reflect that opinion when it comes to the people they vote for at the ballot box and the 1% of people that thought there was nothing wrong with it\u2026would feel like the people that believe there is nothing wrong with murder. The fact is\u2026the intolerances that people carry around on a personal level shape the society that we live in\u2026over the years as people have become more and more comfortable with gay marriage and more people are thinking that it SHOULDN\u2019T be outlawed\u2026the resistance at the ballot box has died down. Eventually there are large enough pockets of people that aren\u2019t intolerant of it in certain states that they remove the law on a state level\u2026and eventually the sentiment spreads to the majority of the country until it is passed at a federal level. The only difference between the old world where gay marriage was illegal and the new world where gay marriage is legal is a shifting of public opinion about what they\u2019re going to be intolerant towards. That shifting of public opinion is really just millions of people shifting their own personal intolerances.\n\n> Something interesting to think about is that this goes for anything\u2026if enough people believed that murder was ok, we could truly live in a world where people walked around on the street\u2026two guys have a disagreement in Home Depot about the price of the shovel\u2026one guy gets beaten to death with a shovel and nothing happens. This is both extremely worrying and extremely empowering at the same time.\n\n> The reason it\u2019s empowering is that the only thing stopping you from living in the exact country that you want to live in is a few million people being convinced one way or the other about their intolerances. Think about that\u2026think about how possible that is. Have you ever known someone that was intolerant or naive about a particular group of people and after you had a few conversations with them they eventually started coming around? Isn\u2019t this all that Voltaire did on a massive scale with his writing during his lifetime? Think about how powerful that is. Think about the potential if everybody had those conversations. Now that\u2019s not to say that everyone is going to be receptive\u2026trust me I know\u2026there are TONS of people that just aren\u2019t willing to listen. They believe what they believe because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve always believed and the last thing they\u2019re going to do is take an honest look in the mirror because then they would have to stop clinging on to this much EASIER way of looking at the world.\n\n> Now understanding the power of engaging people\u2026understanding that changing the mind of someone that is holding beliefs that are actively hurting other people is potentially just a conversation away\u2026let\u2019s consider the initial question again: How intolerant are you willing to be towards intolerance? Think about the bus driver again\u2026she vehemently believed that the views of this high school girl were bigoted and intolerant towards gay people and women\u2026she truly believed that the prejudices she held were actively causing people harm. Paradise is a conversation away. Knowing that you have that power given the structure of our government\u2026how far are you willing to go to change the mind of someone who holds in tolerances that are hurting others?\n\n> The fact is\u2026the bus driver didn\u2019t behead this girl behind a bale of hay\u2026she declared a war of ideas. And while I severely question her judgment when it comes to declaring it on a 17 year old girl\u2026it isn\u2019t that different than what Voltaire supports all throughout his philosophical letters. Voltaire was a general in this war of ideas that was going on. And lucky for us\u2026Voltaire won the battle of tolerance.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_38": {"date": "2014-12-1", "text": "Posted on December 1, 2014\nEpisode 44 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #044 on Slavery. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo a couple weeks ago we had an episode on belief\u2026 and in many ways this episode is a continuation of that episode. I say that because many of the thought lines that were originally talked about in that episode are expanded upon here, so if you haven\u2019t listened to it yet, do yourself a favor and go back and listen to it\u2026but let\u2019s be real\u2026you guys have all heard that episode\u2026probably multiple times\u2026\nif you haven\u2019t I have nothing to say to you\u2026except for this very short recap. the belief episode was basically like an awareness campaign, but instead of spreading awareness about a horrible disease like prostate cancer or Lou Gherig\u2019s disease\u2026you know something that affects millions of people a year\u2026the belief episode was an ice bucket challenge for a horrible disease that plagues 7 billion people a year because as long as you\u2019re a human being with senses, intuitions or an ability to reason that can deceive you\u2026you are living with this condition every day of your life.\nThe condition that I\u2019m talking about is the problem that because of the very flawed human tools we have at our disposal for acquiring knowledge\u2026for all intents and purposes, certainty is impossible\u2026and that starts to become a dangerous recipe when its combined with the fact that that there are no limits to what we can allow ourselves to believe if we are gullible enough. We can literally believe ANYTHING that we want to believe.\nWhat you believe has absolutely nothing to do with how true it is. Now, every single one of us realizes this\u2026we\u2019ve all been children before\u2026you don\u2019t gotta think very hard to remember a time when you held a belief for bad reasons.\nThis is underscored by the fact that we\u2019ve all at some point held beliefs for bad reasons\u2026for reasons that have nothing to do with how true they are\u2026whether it\u2019s because we WANT them to be true or because it would be very convenient if they were true, but that doesn\u2019t make them true.\nSo if that bothers you\u2026if you want your beliefs to be as close to the truth as possible and not just a collection of things that you like to tell yourself\u2026you instantly assume a life long responsibility\u2026you need to constantly look at your beliefs through a critical lens\u2026you need to constantly consider every new piece of information that becomes available to you. Because If you\u2019re really focused on the truth for the truth\u2019s sake\u2026you can never get lazy\u2026you can never say..I believe this thing\u2026and no matter what anyone says and no matter what evidence I see to the contrary\u2026I will always believe it.\n\nNow if you follow this thinking to its logical conclusion, the tagline that you eventually arrive at is that \u201cevery belief at some level is a leap of faith, but not all leaps of faith are created equal.\u201d But this isn\u2019t the end of the discussion is it? No, there\u2019s much more to talk about\u2026much more conversation to be had. Today I want to address one of the most common follow-up questions to this\u2026I\u2019ve gotten several emails asking this very question\u2026and I can\u2019t think of a better way to do it than by relating it to one of these critical issues that were being rethought in the enlightenment: the practice of slavery.\nAnd before I begin and tell you the question\u2026I just want to make sure this is clarified: If the belief episode was supposed to spread awareness about this condition that we\u2019re all born into\u2026then this episode is designed to tell you just how much is at stake because of this condition. Try to think about the cost. When you hold beliefs for lazy reasons\u2026it quickly goes beyond just putting ourselves in chains\u2026it can quite literally keep others in chains as well.\n\nThe question that we\u2019re going to be talking about is a very common follow up to what we\u2019ve been talking about the last few episodes and it goes like this: So, if certainty is impossible, then why would you ever CHOOSE to spend your entire life chasing a ghost? Why spend every second of your life chasing some elusive thing you\u2019ll never catch when the alternative, though it isn\u2019t true, feels so good to believe? Let\u2019s say I believe in an afterlife\u2026even if my belief ends up not being true, it sure made me FEEL a lot happier all these years to believe that I wouldn\u2019t have to ever stop living\u2026that I\u2019d get to talk to people for trillions of years. the point that their making is that since truth is so slippery to get a hold of\u2026Isn\u2019t it better to just believe things not based on how true they are but based on how helpful they are to me personally?\nThis is a very good question\u2026and let\u2019s explore both sides of it a little deeper. Because I think the person that argues this point although they have good intentions\u2026they\u2019re arguing this point on crutches\u2026they really want to make doubt into a terrible mindset to have\u2026they want to make the condition of not knowing things for certain as unpleasant as possible so that they can say: Well, you\u2019d have to be a masochist to willingly subject yourself to that kind of torture, doubting things all the time\u2026 when on the other hand you can just believe one thing, wash your hands and never change it!\nOn one hand we can all see where they\u2019re coming from. The whole process does seem a little neurotic on the surface, I mean, if you want your beliefs to be based on truth\u2026and to accomplish that you keep honing your beliefs and trying to make them the closest facsimile of truth possible..even if at some point in your life you hold beliefs that happen to be true, you\u2019re never going to know that they\u2019re true\u2026it will always be a leap of faith\u2026\nCan you imagine what your life looks like if you take that to the extreme? Well do you remember when we talked about Pyrrho from Ancient Greece? Pyrrho was this incredibly radical skeptic. This guy was famous around town for being so skeptical about things in his life that he suspended judgement about everything to a ridiculous level.\nThere\u2019s stories about him staggering around the streets like he was Mr. Magoo\u2026there\u2019d be a cart barreling down the road\u2026he didn\u2019t care\u2026he doubted things so much he\u2019d just step out in front of it and his friends would have to save him. I don\u2019t know why they stayed friends with him\u2026he was like a big toddler for them to take care of. But his skepticism ran so deep that there\u2019s even stories of him having surgery performed on him without even flinching because he was that committed\u2026he refused to pretend he was certain about the idea that pain is a bad thing.\nThe question is\u2026why would you knowingly embark on a quest that you know you\u2019ll never finish, especially when the alternative can be so awesome. There is no question that we can be made happier by holding lazy beliefs that paint the world to be the way that we want it to be. I can believe that the holocaust never happened\u2026I can believe that I am correct about every belief that I hold and that I am the smartest person in the world\u2026I can believe that when I die I\u2019m going to get to see my grandfather again and this time his arthritis is going to be healed and hes not gonna be cranky all the time! I don\u2019t think many people would doubt that holding these beliefs would make us at least in a very shallow and short term sense\u2026happier people than believing that some terrible alternative was true.\nBut there\u2019s another side to this isn\u2019t there? If false beliefs can make us artificially happy\u2026they can also make us artificially sad or angry. I don\u2019t think I gotta convince you guys much of this\u2026just take any example. Someone can be rendered miserable because they believe that they are trapped in some dead end job with no possible way of escaping it\u2026they can believe that one of their relatives died, bawl their eyes out, be in mourning for the next three months just to find out it was an elaborate April Fools Prank. The point is\u2026any one of us can come up with countless examples on either side of how our false beliefs can make us artificially happy OR artificially sad.\nThe fact is\u2026and this is a very empowering and important point to think about\u2026our beliefs don\u2019t just affect us\u2026.we live in a world where our own individual beliefs can positively or negatively affect \u2026 animals, other humans and even the planet that we live on. That\u2019s huge. What are some examples of what I\u2019m talking about. You know..when it comes to animals\u2026if you believe that when you buy meat from the grocery store it\u2019s coming from a farm that looks like its run by old McDonald\u2026you could be holding beliefs that allow for all the atrocities that are committed in the current factory farming culture.\nWhen it comes to the planet\u2026If you believe that there is nothing wrong with dumping a little bit of toxic waste in the ocean, you could be holding beliefs that are doing long term damage that you may not even realize. When it comes to humans\u2026if you believe that the human species is not just one species of primate that should be treated equally by society, but that different races or cultures that are more suited for manual labor were PUT HERE by nature to be our indentured servants\u2026well you could be locking people in chains for centuries forcing them to serve you lemonade and never think twice about it.\nNow, I wanna set the stage here for our discussion coming up\u2026 we live in a great time\u2026I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that everybody listening to this does not agree that enslaving people is an OK thing to do. You\u2019d probably think that if somebody DID think it was OK there were either\nA) severely disconnected from modern culture\nB) completely amoral\nor C) a little stupid\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been that way and that point that we all should consider, especially as it applies to our own beliefs that we hold in 2014\u2026 is that throughout history\u2026it hasn\u2019t always been amoral or stupid people that have been advocates of slavery. Back during the good ol\u2019 days of slavery\u2026you weren\u2019t seen as an evil person for owning slaves\u2026just like people in today\u2019s world aren\u2019t seen as evil for buying meat from the grocery store.\nSlavery was the norm back then\u2026and based on our simple understanding of where humans fit in the natural world\u2026based on where science was at then\u2026there were a lot of respected academics\u2026undeniable geniuses\u2026the intellectual pillars of their time period that thought they had some really solid arguments pro-slavery. Again these weren\u2019t evil or stupid people\u2026They looked at the fact that there were these obvious differences between cultures and used their own intuition to arrive at lazy beliefs that led them to think that some creative power organized the world in a way where some of these cultures were designed to work for others.\nBut let\u2019s not try to reduce a couple thousand years of thought into a single paragraph. I want to have a debate on the Philosophize This! podcast this week, I will be your moderator\u2026and the motion today is \u201cSlavery is not OK!\u201d\u2026arguing against the motion are a few philosophers you guys will all be familiar with\u2026unquestionably the most brilliant thinkers of their day\u2026debating out of a wide range of time\u2026from antiquity and the middle ages\u2026give it up for the supporters of slavery: Aristotle, St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas!\nAnd on the other side of the stage in the great slavery debate is one man that we haven\u2019t talked about yet, but his comments on slavery forever changed the way the world looked at the practice. He was seen as the biggest competition to Voltaire in the enlightenment period and his political thought deeply influenced the French Revolution\u2026his name is Jean Jacques Rousseau.\nNow lets start by talking about the arguments FOR slavery that were so prevalent for thousands of years in Europe. Because its understandable that a lot of people living in modern times must be a little confused by this\u2026I mean sure you can understand the average Joe going along with slavery\u2026but these guys were geniuses. How could any of these brilliant people look around them and not see this for what it actually was\u2026purposeful exploitation by the powerful? Well that\u2019s something for us to really think about this week when we look at the beliefs we hold in 2014\u2026.consider the fact that even something as unanimously detestable as slavery was justified by brilliant people for thousands of years.\nAnyway, lets start with Aristotle. We mentioned his views on slavery very briefly in Aristotle part 2. Aristotle says in his politics:\n\n\u201cFor that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule\u2026\u201d\nSo one day Aristotle\u2019s walking around in his toga\u2026he looks around him and he reasons that there seems to be two kinds of people in this world. Slaves and non-slaves. The same way someone today might go outside look around them\u2026draw a conclusion based on what makes the most sense to them and think this must be the way that it is\u2026Aristotle, being a byproduct of a culture with a minimal understanding about the natural world\u2026looked around him and thought it was obvious there were two types of humans.\n\nIt seemed very clear to him that these slaves were born different than non-slaves like Aristotle. In particular, they were born with the majority of the rational part of their soul missing. They still had some small ability to reason, but only enough to get their manual labor done. He thought it was clear, based on what he saw that they were essentially domesticated animals\u2026and slavery wasn\u2019t a bad thing for them at all. Just like a dog and his master both benefit from that arrangement\u2026the slave, non-slave relationship was a mutually beneficial one too. Obviously the non-slaves get tons of work done for them, but the slaves, Aristotle thought needed the non-slaves to manage their lives for them. They could never do it alone with their limited ability to reason.\nBut Aristotle thinks it is clear that these slaves were COMPLETELY animals..they still had some amount of virtue that made them a human and therefore, higher up on the hierarchy of nature than animals.\n\nNow, if we\u2019re going to look at our beliefs and try to understand where we may be mistaken\u2026What do you think he saw that made him hold these beliefs that ended up being dead wrong? Well, knowing what we know now\u2026he must have seen people that came from two very different educational backgrounds and made him think they were two different species. We can kind of see what made Aristotle draw this conclusion\u2026take one person that has been forced to work their entire life and one person that was fortunate enough to have at least some semblance of an education\u2026and to someone living back then\u2026no matter how smart you were\u2026it may have seemed totally obvious that these are two different types of human beings.\nKeep in mind\u2026these beliefs didn\u2019t hurt Aristotle in any way. You know\u2026Aristotle wasn\u2019t caused any sort of unhappiness as he was being fanned by palm leaves\u2026but here\u2019s a great example of how one person\u2019s beliefs that on one hand make them happier can lead to very real human suffering and injustice on the other.\n\nSo the next person to give an argument on the pro-slavery end of the stage in our great slavery debate is St. Augustine. Now, Augustine never wrote formally or at length about slavery, so what we have are excerpts from multiple works where he discusses slavery and it starts to unravel into a pretty clear picture of how he feels. He said:\n\u201cIt is with justice, we believe, that the condition of slavery is the result of sin. And this is why we do not find the word \u2018slave\u2019 in any part of Scripture until righteous Noah branded the sin of his son with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin and not by nature.\u201d\nSo St. Augustine is a christian and he makes it very clear that he doesn\u2019t think slavery was part of God\u2019s original plan at all\u2026I mean he didn\u2019t create all these people so that millions of them could be pack mules\u2026in fact, Augustine says that you don\u2019t even see the word slave in scripture at all until Noah started throwing the word around. What this means to him is that slavery is an advent of sinful man and not God. But Augustine thinks\u2026 that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it something we need to actively try to end.\nLook, Augustine\u2019s job when living on this planet is not to abolish sin completely. On the contrary, sin is a part of god\u2019s plan. To be against sin is to be against god in a certain way. We should give people enough rope to eternally hang themselves with\u2026after all what other way are we going to be able to separate who gets into heaven and who gets tortured than by allowing them to sin? Nobodies perfect\u2026slavery is inevitable in this world in the same way that sin is inevitable as part of god\u2019s plan.\nNow it should be said, Augustine is an advocate for slaves on a level that is unprecedented for his time period. He\u2019s one of the first thinkers to talk about how a master should be a loving father figure to his slaves and he urges the church to make freeing your slaves seen as a virtuous act. because they are the moral authority at this time. But he gives other pro-slavery arguments\u2026even one that is very similar to a line of thinking in the pre-enlightenment period with people like john Locke\u2026the argument was that slavery\u2026 really should be seen as a lesser of two evils. St. Augustine asks\u2026lets think about how slaves are made in the first place?\nSome conquering army marches into town\u2026absorbs the women and children into the tribe and kills all the men. Well, isn\u2019t it a much less bloody and much better alternative to just enslave them, sell them or force them to work? Slavery was actually a benevolent act\u2026at least you were allowing them to live!\nNow again, like we did with Aristotle\u2026lets put ourselves in Augustine\u2019s shoes\u2026we can see how he would think that slavery was something that we just have to live with. I mean, if you believe that this universe was created and is maintained by the Christian God\u2026at least the way people were interpreting scripture during his brief lifetime\u2026if you believe that sin is a necessary byproduct of the universe god created, its god\u2019s way for us to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to who is ethical, and that god has kind of a hands-off approach when it comes to these sorts of things\u2026then the rest of it really isn\u2019t that crazy.\nEven during Augustine\u2019s lifetime he would\u2019ve looked at people that believed in a different set of religious beliefs than his and he would\u2019ve thought that they were sorely mistaken. It\u2019s very easy to see the parallels to the tensions between religions in the modern world.\n\nSo the last debater on the pro-slavery side of the table was Thomas Aquinas and on one hand he was a sort of Aristotelian continuation of Augustine\u2026he was filled with novelty and the slavery discussion was no exception. He pointed out that God probably doesn\u2019t endorse slavery\u2026but just look at nature\u2026it seems to be implying something:\n\u201cfor men of outstanding intelligence naturally take command, while those who are less intelligent but of more robust physique, seem intended by nature to act as servants;\u201d\nHe\u2019s pointing out that all you have to do is look around you and see that we are all born with different natural gifts\u2026some people are smart\u2026some people have a \u201crobust physique\u201d\u2026it seems like these robust fellows were put here to do our gardening and serve us cracker. There\u2019s a part of God\u2019s order that implies that there is some sort of hierarchy. He even points to scripture\u2026he points out that some angels were more powerful or more important that other angels\u2026there\u2019s obviously a hierarchy among the animals\u2026why is it crazy to think that humans can be sub divided too?\nIt should be said that Aquinas\u2019s idea of a slave was different than many people\u2019s ideas. He compares them to sons. Just like a son belongs to his father and it is the father\u2019s job to regulate and restrict and even hit his son to keep him in line\u2026a slave is no different. But Aquinas is a really nice guy\u2026he says we should be good masters of our slaves and not hit them unless it is absolutely necessary.\nSo again, as we did with the last two thinkers\u2026here\u2019s another great example of a categorical genius looking at the world around him, arriving at beliefs that seem to be obvious based on his own intuitions. Oh, I\u2019m a human and I look around me and it seems intuitive that there is a hierarchy in nature, why wouldn\u2019t that extend to human beings!\n\nSo what did Rousseau have to say in response to all of this? Rousseau is most famous for his political philosophy laid out in his famous work called the social contract, and when he writes his stuff about slavery he points out that, you know what? I see a lot of similarities between slaves and people just born into a tyrannical monarch society where they had no say in how they were governed in the first place.\nNow when it comes to a system of government\u2026how do we impose laws upon a population in the first place? Well Rousseau thinks it happens in one of two ways\u2026and it\u2019s not ironic at all, Rousseau says, that they are the exact same two ways people are made into slaves. The first way is by brute force \u2026the second way is by consent. Let\u2019s talk about Rousseau\u2019s reasons for why BOTH of these are trash.\nWe\u2019ve all seen brute force before. Army or bully takes over a geographic proximity\u2026attaches a chain to your leg and calls you his property. He imposes a set of rules upon you and maintains it by force. What about when we are born into a society ruled by a tyrannical dictator?\n\nTo make a case that EITHER of these two situations are justified\u2026we have to make a case that during the enlightenment was better known as the right of the strongest. This basically is what a lot of people were arguing if you break it down far enough\u2026the idea that slavery is OK simply because some group is strong enough to impose it upon another group. Rousseau would ask\u2026do we have a moral obligation to play along with these people simply because they are stronger than us? Is something made right or wrong simply because the strongest group or being deemed it to be right?\nThe way to clarify the point that Rousseau is making here is by looking at it from the other side\u2026if someone is born and is captured and taken into slavery and they follow all the rules of their slave master and be a good slave\u2026does that make them necessarily a MORAL person? Or more generally\u2026does just submitting to power make you a moral person?\nThis probably reminds you of a typical argument against a follower of one of the monotheistic religions that is thrown their way by Atheists\u2026you know they ask\u2026if the only reason you aren\u2019t murdering your neighbor for stepping on your lawn is because God will punish you if you don\u2019t do it, does that really make you a moral person or just a slave to power? Rousseau would say that adhering to brute force is an act of prudence\u2026not morality. Morality is something much different. As both sides of this modern argument would agree with.\nSo, The point that Rousseau is making here is that something like slavery isn\u2019t justified when it is done by brute force because that would imply that morality is by whoever the strongest is\u2026and that obviously is slippery and would change a lot. What Rousseau is aiming to do in this part of the social contract is to tear apart any sort of justification of slavery.\nSo after rebuking the argument that might makes right\u2026he is left with the second way someone might have become a slave back then..by their own consent.\nBelieve it or not guys, some people willingly agreed to being a piece of someone else\u2019s property\u2026there were many different reasons someone would do this back then\u2026so it begs the question\u2026can someone willingly sell themselves into slavery?\nRousseau says no. Slavery is even wrong in THIS case and he argues by responding to the guy before him that argued the other way around Thomas Hobbes.\nremember Thomas Hobbes believed that maintaining order was the ultimate goal of the sovereign and that people COULD \u201cgive themselves over\u201d to the sovereign and it doesn\u2019t need to be a bad thing or something that\u2019s morally detestable\u2026it could be a personally beneficial thing to do. Rousseau doesn\u2019t agree with this line of reasoning and he is responding to Hobbes\u2019 and his idea of the sovereign supposedly benefiting all these people when he says:\n\u201c\u2018The despot guarantees civic peace in the state\u2019, you may say. Granted; but what do the people gain if\n\u2022the wars his ambition brings down on them,\n\u2022his insatiable greed, and\n\u2022harassments by his ministers\nbring them more misery than they\u2019d have suffered from their own dissensions \u00b7if no monarchy had been established\u00b7? What do they gain if this peace is one of their miseries? You can live peacefully in a dungeon, but does that make it a good life? The Greeks imprisoned in the cave of the Cyclops lived there peacefully while waiting for their turn to be eaten. To say that a man gives himself \u00b7to someone else, i.e. hands himself over\u00b7 free, is to say something absurd and inconceivable; such an act is null and illegitimate, simply because the man who does it is out of his mind. To say the same of a whole people is to suppose a people of madmen; and madness doesn\u2019t create any right.\u201d\nOK, so what hes saying here is this: Brute force is not a legitimate way of determining what rights people have. The only way is by social agreement. Rousseau thinks that for anybody to actually volunteer themselves to forfeit every right that they have they would have to be crazy. He says if you doubt this\u2026just look at the contract this guy is signing.\nUh so let me get this straight. you\u2019re giving up your status as a man, your rights as a human being and even your duties as a human being\u2026and I give you a slaves life. What sane person would ever sign that agreement? Rousseau talks about how any agreement, to insure it\u2019s beneficial to both parties in the long term and to make sure no one is taking advantage of anyone needs to be signed and readdressed at usual increments by both parties\u2026but what would those meetings look like in the case of a slave? OK\u2026well I own you and with it every right you have to speak your mind about anything\u2026so this meeting is adjourned.\nWhat kind of agreement is that? What kind of insurance can you have that they will do anything that they said if they own you? Like, what kind of requests could you ever make there?\nAfter all, how can you be said to be agreeing to anything if you have no choice in the matter? Then Rousseau brings up what I think is one of the most powerful points in any of his works\u2026can morality exist without freedom? If you aren\u2019t free to be making poor decisions, how can you be said to be making good decisions? You don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. In that same way\u2026when you remove someone\u2019s freedom\u2026then you remove the morality from anything that they do\u2026And that would prove to be immensely important when it came to his political philosophy that we will talk about soon.\nAs far as slavery being a lesser evil than killing a conquered population\u2026Rousseau thinks all you are really doing is extending the state of war into a master-slave relationship.\n\nSo the point of this episode was two fold\u2026on one hand I wanted to provide a bare-bones foundation for the next episode when we really look into the politics of Rousseau\u2026and on the other hand I wanted to emphasize what\u2019s at stake whenever we hold beliefs about something. And look, I get that this stuff isn\u2019t rocket science, but seriously look around you. This is something that most people take for granted.\nJust ask yourself a question right now\u2026Do you honestly think that you know everything? You know\u2026it\u2019s easy to look back at people 100 years ago and laugh at how stupid they were\u2026ha! look at them thinking there\u2019s nothing wrong with the treaty of Versailles! look at them in the 1400\u2019s with their crude medicine and superstitions! You could do this with any time period\u2026you could take it all the way back to 500 BC and these people could honestly sit around and watch Nick Jr. all day and never stop learning stuff.\nBut I\u2019m not trying to beat a dead horse here\u2026do you honestly think that you\u2019re exempt from that? Do you think that this generation is some sort of evolutionary endpoint\u2026future humans are going to look back and say\u2026wow THAT\u2019S when they finally got it right!\nI got news for you\u2026we are all going to be seen as barbarians\u2026obviously not as much as previous generations\u2026but if you\u2019re perceptive you can look around you and guess the kinds of things that future generations are going to look back on and think we were insane for accepting.\n\nLook this shouldn\u2019t be a defeatist attitude. The fact that by the time you turned 18 you didn\u2019t know everything there is to know about the world shouldn\u2019t be something that makes you give up or be depressed\u2026.it should be inspiring! You shouldn\u2019t just say, well you cant know anything for certain anyway, so I\u2019ll just believe whatever makes me the happiest! No, you aren\u2019t the center of the universe\u2026you aren\u2019t the only thing that needs to be considered because your beliefs affect a lot more than just you.\nBy all means\u2026if you hold a belief that makes you happy\u2026keep it. I fully endorse that behavior. But understand that there is a whole other side to that belief and if you\u2019re going to resign yourself from trying\u2026can you do the rest of us one favor? Before you decide to purposefully suspend your critical thinking out of convenience\u2026before you decide to put the blinders on for the rest of your life\u2026for the sake of the rest of humanity\u2026can you just take a few days and think about that belief\u2026do a little bit of research and find out if it could possibly hurt anyone else around you unfairly? At least do that and then go on about your life and be happy.\nNow, we\u2019ve been talking a lot about our individual beliefs\u2026how they affect our lives and the people around us\u2026but the enlightenment wasn\u2019t just a leap forward in this area\u2026it was an exponential leap in many areas of thought\u2026economics\u2026government\u2026etc\u2026.and we\u2019re going to start looking into others starting next episode. But keep these points in mind as we move forward and I look forward to seeing each and every one of you next time\u2026the most open minded audience in the history of podcasting.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_39": {"date": "2014-12-14", "text": "Posted on December 14, 2014\nEpisode 45 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #045 on Government. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAhoy Maytees! I'm Stephen west the host of the Philosophize This! podcast and I want to start the show today by using our imaginations! We're gonna start the show today with a little thought experiment. I want you to imagine that were all taking a vacation and were meeting \u00a0up in Los Angeles harbor, tens of thousands of people all meet up, our bags are packed, we all have terrible Hawaiian shirts on and were going on the Philosophize This! cruise line! We're gonna talk about philosophy, we're gonna play board games, it's gonna be great! We all file onto the ship\u2026we get out into the middle of the ocean, and then BOOM! The ship hits something! It springs a leak!\nWe look on the starboard side and it turns out we hit a coral reef\u2026we hit a rock\u2026we hit that giant patch of garbage that's floating out in the middle of the pacific\u2026and the ship is going down. There's nothing we can do to plug the leak, but lucky for us, everyone gets off the cruise ship safely because there is a deserted island not far away from the wreckage.\u00a0\nWe all get up on the beach, we begin to assess the situation and we realize very quickly that our situation is a dire one. The captain was drunk, fell asleep at the wheel\u2026fell asleep at the helm\u2026which explains why he ran directly into the giant patch of garbage in the middle of the ocean\u2026we all realize very quickly that he didn't radio for help and that we are marooned on this island with the only possibility of escape being that a ship or plane passes by and sees us frantically waving around on the beach.\u00a0\nWhat do we do now?\nCause there's gonna be that moment when we all start to look around and size each other up. At least I know I would. Look, the problem with being stranded on an island with you people is that I know every one of you has read Lord of the Flies. I'm not gonna be the piggy on this island. Am I gonna be piggy? No.\u00a0\nFact is everyone's looking around for people with big forearms and calves because as soon as we can't find food on this deserted island\u2026you're going to be the first one spinning around on the rotisserie with an apple in your mouth. But it doesn't need to be like this.\nWe're going to be standing around on that beach asking questions like, What are we going to do? Who's in charge? Is there anyone in charge? What do we want this person that's in charge to do? What are the limits to this person's power? Why does it have to be a single person, can't it be a council of people?\n\nThe fact of the matter is, if you were an enlightenment age political philosopher\u2026this is the situation you had to put yourself in to be able to properly think about what the role of government is and why it is justified.\u00a0\nYou know, we're all born into a world where there's just a government. You pay money to it and it protects you in various ways, or at least tries to. Most of us don't really question it\u2026living under the protection and control of a government is just something we take for granted, and historically, dictators have realized this. You may be born into some sort of tyrannical regime and never really question why you're paying these people taxes or why you're listening to them. Why do you pay money to the country you currently reside in? Most people haven't thought about it that much. They just do it.\u00a0\nWell there were a lot of things in this new enlightenment world that were getting rethought. And as we started to think about all these old assumptions we were making that were potentially holding us back\u2026whats the first place you're gonna start looking? Oh\u2026how bout that guy over there in the velvet robe with the scepter that tells me what to do all the time? who's that guy\u2026when did I agree to be his sugar daddy for the rest of my life.\u00a0\nYou know\u2026some guy comes up to me on the street and takes my money\u2026that gets him thrown in prison\u2026the guy on the throne comes and takes my money\u2026well that's called a \"tax\". How is this justifiable? What is he doing with that money? What is the extent of his power and how do we insure that? We were asking a LOT of questions during this time period\u2026and the biggest one is probably the first question you would ask: Why do we even need a government at all?\nThis is a very good question to ask\u2026and it's far from an obvious answer. Are we better off as individuals without a government? Well, to answer that let's think about what a government \u00a0even does for us\u2026then let's imagine ourselves without it. Lucky for us, this isn't gonna be very difficult because were all stranded on an island right now. So let's think about it.\u00a0\nLet's say we never organize a government and the island turns into an every person for themselves situation. What would that world look like? Would it be chaotic? Would it be very peaceful? Philosophers largely disagree about what just this state of nature would even look like.\u00a0\nThomas Hobbes, guy we've talked about before, he thought that it would be a constant state of war. Remember he called it \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". That was life in the state of nature. There is no right or wrong because there are no laws in place to deem what is right or wrong\u2026.so in Hobbes' state of nature It wouldn't be wrong for one of you on the island to kill me and take all my stuff because there is no contract that we've both signed that insures anything. This a good place to pause and think about something for a minute.\nWhen we think about this hypothetical shipwreck that we were just in\u2026we can all imagine Hobbes' state of nature becoming a reality. Maybe people separate into warring factions\u2026maybe the most powerful guy just walks around taking stuff or enslaving other people\u2026.the point is we can all imagine an island where it might be beneficial to band together and make an arrangement. Most of us probably agree that we don't want certain things coming to fruition. Right?\nLet's just pick a basic example. We could be standing around on the island and we could say, OK, I don't want to be murdered. Do you want to be murdered? How about you guys over there, do you want to be murdered? OK well now that we know we all agree there\u2026 listen\u2026I know this really big muscular guy\u2026the guy is terrifying\u2026he's got crooked eyes. How about we all live in this general vicinity and if anyone comes around talking about how they're going to murder someone, This guy with the crooked eyes will show them the door.\u00a0\nBut this guy needs to get paid right. He's not going to do this for free. How about we all chip in 100 bucks and make sure he makes this happen and we all benefit from it! Now, from here it's easy to imagine this extending beyond just murder. There are certain baseline insurances that we would want this very basic island government to maintain for everyone that is part of our group.\nSo obviously Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau never used the island example\u2026 with the dude with the crooked eyes\u2026. but this is just a way for us to think about this initial question: Do we even need a government in the first place? Well on our deserted island, we can see how having this third party with certain clear tasks assigned to it could be tremendously beneficial to us.\nBut Jean Jacques Rousseau didn't necessarily think that this had to be the case though. You know, if you look back at history\u2026whenever there are giant shifts in the way that entire societies are thinking about things, there's always going to be a backlash. These things rarely go smoothly\u2026I mean the scope of the change that was going on during the enlightenment period was completely unprecedented\u2026we can expect consequences.\u00a0\nWhen you go, in such a short period of time, from thinking the way we were thinking for centuries to the enlightenment\u2026you know zero to the enlightenment in 4.3 seconds\u2026there's going to be side effects and one of these side effects has become known as Romanticism.\u00a0\nWe all know by now\u2026starting to sound like a broken record that the enlightenment is characterized by rationalism. The application of reason to all of these longstanding institutions that needed fixing. Well after a while of doing this\u2026people starting thinking that maybe we went a little too far with all of this reason stuff. You know\u2026think of reason like it were medicine. Nobodies questioning whether we were sick\u2026and when you're sick and you take some medicine\u2026you feel better, but if you take too much medicine\u2026you could be talking like you're Al Sharpton the rest of your life.\u00a0\nWhen you exalt reason to the level that was being done during the enlightenment and you suppress something like human emotion\u2026something that is such an undeniable part of our experience on this planet\u2026you can expect backlash and that backlash was Romanticism: A strong emphasis placed on human emotion as a superior guide and in not all, but many cases \u2026a heightened focus on humans in nature and looking back to times when humans were closer connected to nature as better than where we are now.\nI'm not going to be able to sum up Romanticism in a single sentence, but let's talk about Rousseau's contribution as an\u2026 enormous influencer in the movement and more importantly how all this relates to us finding the best way of governing ourselves while were stranded on the island.\u00a0\nSo\u2026due to circumstances in Rousseau's life\u2026there was a period of time that he would commonly take a really long trip through the woods\u2026 on foot. Now, on one of these trips he was trying to pass the time and he was reading the newspaper. In the newspaper\u2026on this particular day, there was a contest. They asked the readers of the newspaper to write an essay giving their opinions on a question and the question was: has the progress made in the areas of the arts and sciences been more of a bane or a benefit to society.\u00a0\nNow keep in mind, 90% or more of the people responding to this question would have looked around them and saw categorical improvements in people's lives\u2026 systems of government, improvements in medicine, the industrial revolution\u2026but the position that eventually won the contest for Rousseau, the epiphany that he had sitting under a tree on this long walk through the woods that day was the opposite.\u00a0\nTo Rousseau, we weren't better off because of all of this progress. In fact, the entire long history of civilization\u2026 can really be seen as things getting worse. Because the further we get into this artificial state that we call culture and art and sciences, the further removed we are from the state of nature, where we really belong. He gives a few different examples in the writing\u2026he talks about early civilizations like Sparta and how they're more simplistic and natural and he contrasts that with the civilizations of his time or even what Athens eventually became.\u00a0\nHe sums up his thoughts really well here:\n\"While government and laws take care of the security and the well being of men in groups, the sciences, letters, and the arts, less despotic and perhaps more powerful, spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains which weigh men down, snuffing out in them the feeling of that original liberty for which they appear to have been born, and make them love their slavery by turning them into what are called civilized people.\u201d\nSo Rousseau is obviously taking a very counter-culture position here. To be what we call civilized during the time of Rousseau is just to be someone that has been made to love your form of slavery. The arts and sciences are just garlands of flowers sprinkled over the iron chains that weigh people down. What is it to be civilized? And is that necessarily a better state than what came before we were civilized?\nWell what came before? If you listen to Hobbes\u2026the state of nature was really bad. A state of CONSTANT war. Who wants to live in that\u2026and this was his justification for why it actually benefited people to sacrifice many of their rights over to the sovereign whose job it was to \"maintain order\". That was the role of government to Thomas Hobbes, to maintain order.\u00a0\nLike remember back on the island when we were standing in a circle talking about that guy with the crooked eyes\u2026when we give him 100 coconuts\u2026what do we want him to do for us? Well it goes beyond protection from murder\u2026we don't want to be stolen from, we don't want to be assaulted, we don't want to be enslaved\u2026well what all these political philosophers did is they tried to find out\u2026is there something that underlies all of these individual insurances that we want? Is there a macro for all of these micros.\u00a0\nWell Hobbes thought that what were all really asking for\u2026what the role of government is\u2026is to maintain order at all costs. In a way, he is right\u2026nobody wants to live in the chaotic world that he describes in his state of nature.\nJohn Locke years later writes what he thinks is a correction of Hobbes and says that the role of government is actually to protect our natural rights\u2026life, liberty and property. And Rousseau\u2026as we read from last time, obviously disagrees with Hobbes\u2026you know he says that there's a difference between living a peaceful life and living a good life. Sacrificing your rights to a sovereign whose sole job is to maintain order may yield a PEACEFUL life, but you can live peacefully in a dungeon\u2026that doesn't make it a good life\u2026there must be more.\nThe role of government to Rousseau was to promote the general will of the people. What is the general will of the people? Well I actually want to do an entire episode on it next time, I've been looking forward to this episode for a while\u2026tons of great questions to ask about our government, what their responsibilities are\u2026 but for now let's just realize that Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau represent three very different often times conflicting viewpoints on the role of government.\u00a0\nNow you'd think that there wouldn't be that much to disagree about\u2026I mean they're all talking about how the government should be implemented in the same world right? Well, not really. One of the reasons there are so many conflicts between the thinking of Hobbes and Rousseau is because of their very different views of where we come from. They disagree on what the state of nature truly was like.\u00a0\nWhen we're shipwrecked on the deserted island, Hobbes thinks that the state of nature is going to be terrible. We all can see where he's coming from, but I want you to imagine something different for a second. Imagine that during the shipwreck, as the ship is going down\u2026 we all get a very strange case of amnesia where we have zero recollection of anything civilized. We'd have zero recollection of private property, of social conventions, of how governments operate\u2026 everything in that sector. Would that have any effect on what the state of nature looks like?\nWould we still enslave each other? Would we still kill each other over a pineapple? Would we still steal things from each other, or would we have no conception of what stealing is because nothing belongs to anyone? Rousseau thought we wouldn't..Rousseau thought that the state of nature\u2026the original state that humans lived in pre-civilization was actually great! Instead of solitary, nasty, brutish and short\u2026we were peaceful and noble and natural and good.\u00a0\nTo Rousseau\u2026things only started going downhill when civilization started cropping up. In our natural state we do just fine\u2026but we've been corrupted by civilization! In fact, he can identify the very moment when it all happened\u2026although he doesn't claim that this ACTUALLY happened\u2026he is just pointing to the phenomena that led to where we are now.\nRousseau speculates that in the beginning, it all started going downhill when the first guy cordoned off a plot of land, told everyone around him that it was HIS, and they were stupid enough to believe him. That's when we all started to become corrupted. He talks about how when early man would create a hut so that they could co-habitate with the females of the species, that was the straw that broke the camels back. It's all gone downhill from there\u2026one day you're building a hut\u2026the next day\u2026a sky scraper.\u00a0\n\"Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.\" But there is great probability that things had then already come to such a pitch, that they could no longer continue as they were; for the idea of property depends on many prior ideas, which could only be acquired successively, and cannot have been formed all at once in the human mind.\"\nSo what hes saying is that in reality\u2026The fruits of the earth belong to us all and the earth itself to nobody\u2026but naive humans just cannon-balled into the chains that hold them down\u2026they realized the benefits of political institutions, but they lacked the level of foresight to see the problems with them in the long term.\nLike I'm sure all of us have wondered at some point about how arbitrary and strange it is that anyone OWNS a plot of land. Like there was some point in history that someone put a flag in the ground\u2026and now that section of the earth belongs to THAT homo sapien.\u00a0\nAnyway, some of the most interesting pieces of Rousseau are in this narrative that he gives for how humans were corrupted by society. Let's say were stranded on this island and as the ship crashed we all got a case of amnesia about everything we've come to know about society, we wouldn't even need a government. In fact, we probably wouldn't ever want to be rescued\u2026but Rousseau says that we've been irreversibly corrupted by society.\nRousseau says that the state of nature was a GOLDEN AGE. But what happened was as we learned to love each other we also learned to be jealous of each other. We started to compare ourselves to others around us.. this was the first step toward inequality\u2026.when you create this hierarchy\u2026all of a sudden everyone wants respect from each other\u2026they want to be seen as better than those around them and eventually, with the same dynamic existing when it comes to private property, eventually the vast majority of humans are unknowingly sentenced to slavery. \u00a0\nNow this is far from the extent of Rousseau's criticism of organized society\u2026in fact he points out several flaws in the way that it typically pans out. One of the main ones to him is this: so one of the common things people want their government to do is to protect their property. You know\u2026in our island scenario\u2026if we work hard all day to make a strong shelter and collect some food, we don't want someone else to just come along and take it from us. But Rousseau thinks there's a problem whenever protecting property becomes part of what the state does.\u00a0\nRousseau would ask\u2026how is that fair to everyone? What about the people that don't have any property? What about the people who have less property than others? Although it benefits everyone to a certain extent, it will always benefit the rich more than everyone else because they have more property that's being protected. In this way, society could never be completely fair\u2026this is always going to lead to resentment\u2026people become envious and hateful and this leads to all kinds of other problems, but maybe the most interesting one for us to reflect on is that Rousseau thinks that people living in a society are constantly outside of themselves.\u00a0\nThey're constantly away from their true nature which is to be free. They don't get validation from themselves anymore, like they would in the state of nature, they get it from other people around them. We're all just putting on a giant show for everyone around us\u2026we don't ask who we are anymore\u2026we ask other people who we are. And this goes against our very nature. It's like turning down free pizza.\u00a0\nBut it's important to note that just because society can never be completely fair and will always be corrupting us\u2026that doesn't mean that it always needs to be unjust. The way that you establish a just society is by the members of the society forming a legitimate social contract. Rousseau talks about how whenever you enter into a legitimate contract two things happen\u2026you are giving something and you are getting something in return. In the case of the social contract, because in the state of nature you were born free, you are sacrificing this natural freedom for what Rousseau believes is a more useful kind of freedom in today's day and age: political freedom.\u00a0\nSo we're going to continue to expand on Rousseau's views on government in the next episode and we're going to continue our shipwreck analogy. But I want to end the show with something that is extremely powerful to reflect on this week.\u00a0\nWhy is it important to think about what we want from our government? Why is it important to do this thought experiment where we pretend like were stranded on an island and think about how we want the government to execute our expectations? Now on the surface, this may seem like a pointlessly abstract question that isn't going to accomplish anything\u2026I'm sure there's people out there thinking this way..why would you ever sit around trying to think of creative forms of government\u2026there have been plenty of good ways of doing things already laid out\u2026let's just talk about what the best one of them is. Pick from what we already have.\nBut I disagree\u2026I think of all the questions you could think about\u2026if you were just going to sit down on a Saturday and ponder an interesting question\u2026this question may be the that you are most likely to come up with some idea that changes the fate of the human species. There are a lot of abstract questions you could waste your time on\u2026but what makes this question so different is technology. Because no matter how brilliant you are\u2026no matter how brilliant Rousseau, Hobbes and Locke were\u2026there are just ways of implementing government that are possible in today's world that they could never even dream of.\u00a0\nThe efficiency that is possible with the technology that we have today is something that opens up new, exciting possibilities. I mean, there are dozens of examples of this, but just to give you a sample of what I'm talking about\u2026back during the time of Rousseau, Locke and Hobbes\u2026having an absolute democracy where every citizen votes on every single issue was completely ridiculous. There was just no way it would ever work\u2026there were just too many people. It was seen as something that was a good idea in theory\u2026but in practice it could never work if your population was over 50 people.\u00a0\nMy point is, this wasn't even an option to the enlightenment thinkers\u2026but in today's world of smart phones and instant connectivity\u2026we can imagine very easily a world where every citizen could vote on every issue\u2026where we wouldn't need representatives. Now, trust me\u2026I'm not advocating this way of doing things\u2026I tend to fall into the category of people that thinks that the obstacle of taking Thursday morning off of work and having to travel somewhere to cast your vote and get your free cup of juice is a nice filter to have in place\u2026I mean..just imagine this: We interrupt your episode of duck dynasty so that you can vote for president! Please make your selection!\u00a0\nMy point is that with new technology come new possibilities\u2026and it isn't crazy to think that with all this new technology there might be methods of implementing government that are better than any way we've ever done it in the past. It's not crazy to think that one of you might come up with the idea.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_40": {"date": "2015-1-1", "text": "Posted on January 1, 2015\nEpisode 46 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #046 on Government. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nThis is part two\u2026 of what might eventually go down in the annals of history as a series of episodes on How to build a society from scratch.\u00a0\nCause I was thinking about all the stuff we have coming up on the show in the coming weeks and I really think that's really what we're doing here\u2026I was thinking about it. My wife and I own a cupcake shop in Tacoma. (Tacoma is a city in the state of Washington) Anyway, the point of this is that when you talk to my wife about how she comes up with a new seasonal gourmet cupcake flavor or what goes into all of the classic cupcakes\u2026she doesn't think about it in terms of a recipe. I mean, there's a recipe now for the sake of consistency, but before there was a recipe for any one of these cupcakes there was an elaborate test baking phase where she made tiny adjustments\u2026she understands the function of each ingredient in every cupcake.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike, for any of you that don't know, the process of baking something is a really delicate science. This is something I had to learn the hard way\u2026I mean for my whole life baking was very simple\u2026it was just pulling a red box out of the cabinet, adding water and putting this brown mixture/paste into the oven\u2026but you talk to my wife about this stuff\u2026she is a mad scientist. But she's better than a mad scientist because instead of making beakers of weird smoking liquid, she makes these cupcakes that honestly make me contemplate obesity every day of my life.\u00a0\n\nAnd you talk to her about it and she understands everything. If a delicious cupcake is a chemistry experiment\u2026she talks about things like how the eggs interact with the baking powder on this one flavor of cupcake\u2026she'll talk about how and when to add certain ingredients\u2026you know\u2026where in the oven this particular flavor needs to cook to get the right dosage of heat at the right time. It's ridiculous.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyway the point of me wasting the last 60 seconds of your life with this long winded example is to illustrate the value of building a government from scratch. We're all born into a world where when it comes to government, there is a recipe book for us to look at. But by forcing ourselves to pretend as though we're stranded on an island building one of these recipes from scratch, by pretending that there isn't a recipe available to us\u2026we not only have the opportunity of arriving at a customized personalized batch that we think is great, but by thinking about it in these fundamental terms we can better understand the role of each ingredient in these government recipes that were looking at in the future.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe're trying to become more like my wife making cupcakes and less like me making cupcakes\u2026and if that's not enough of an incentive for you, you've never seen me make cupcakes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo real quick, last episode\u2026we all got aboard the Philosophize This cruise ship\u2026our ship crashed into the side of the great pacific garbage patch and before we knew it we were hopelessly stranded on a desert island and forced to establish some ground rules. Now when we crash land on that island with no hope of rescue, there isn't a government in place. There's no police force or fire department or court system\u2026life on that desert island during that interim between when our ship sunk and when we come to some sort of arrangement is the wild west for all intents and purposes. It's a situation that political philosophers call, \"the state of nature.\" The state that things were in BEFORE humans made any of these arrangements to have a government. Pre-civilization.\n\nLast episode we spent a lot of time talking about the giant differences\u2026 between how these political philosophers thought this state of nature played out\u2026most notably\u2026the differences between Thomas Hobbes and Jean Jacques Rousseau. \u2026Hobbes thought the state of nature was a terrible state of constant war\u2026everyone warring against everyone else\u2026and Rousseau didn't agree. In fact, this was one of the biggest critiques Rousseau has against all of the political philosophers that came before him\u2026that they are dishonestly projecting their own biased, post-civilization views of what humans are\u2026 onto these pre-civilization humans who were in their more natural state and lived nothing like what Thomas Hobbes says they did.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell what do you think the state of nature was like? Regardless of where you fall between Hobbes and Rousseau\u2026you have to appreciate what Rousseau is doing here. He's questioning an assumption about human nature. Are humans inherently violent, selfish, brutish?\u2026 whatever adjective you want to use to describe them. This is a really interesting place to pause and think about human nature and how brilliant this critique by Rousseau is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe've all heard people say it in today's world. Look at human history\u2026it's just one war after another\u2026it's human nature to be uncaring and selfish and to just conquer land at the expense of everyone around you. Well is it really fair to label that as \"human nature\"? Is it really fair to just brand that into the side of what it is to be a human? After all, when we look back at human history and see all of the terrible stuff\u2026what are we really looking at? We're looking at the decisions of a very small handful of ambitious men making decisions at the top of civilizations during their respective time periods.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow bear with me\u2026its very easy for me to start sounding like a white knight here, and that is not my intention at all, I just think this is a really interesting thought experiment\u2026how would human history look different if instead of men being at the helm of all of these societies\u2026if instead women were in charge. If we were a matriarchal species. Would there be as much war? Would there be as much opportunistic exploitation?\u00a0\n\nI'm not even saying there wouldn't be\u2026and you can replace women with any other subdivision of human beings. The point is\u2026why is it fair to conflate the decisions of a few hundred ambitious rulers from history with human nature itself? I mean\u2026if were talking about what it means to be human\u2026women are 50% of whatever that is. So when we think about what the nature of a human is\u2026when we think about how we expect humans to act in the state of nature\u2026we need to be careful of not doing what Rousseau thought other political philosophers were guilty of: painting \"human nature\" with too broad of a brush.\u00a0\n\nNonetheless, when our cruise ship crashes and we are all stranded on this island, this conversation doesn't really matter much. Because in the eyes of Rousseau, everybody listening to this has already been corrupted by society since birth. Nothing changes about the fact that we can imagine a world where it would be beneficial to make some sort of agreement where a third party insures certain things for us as citizens of this island.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Rousseau thinks that no matter how hard we think about what that third party looks like\u2026no matter how long we deliberate about what kind of government we're going to have, ultimately it is going to be one of three types. And keep in mind, Rousseau isn't saying that every government that has ever been created neatly falls into one of these three categories\u2026there are tons of obvious examples that don't\u2026governments that fall in between these three categories\u2026governments that are a combination of two out of the three, but to Rousseau\u2026every government is ultimately derived from either a Monarchy, an Aristocracy or a Democracy.\u00a0\n\nWhen all or most of the citizens of a society are what he calls \"magistrates\", the government is a democracy. When half of the citizens or less are magistrates, the government is an aristocracy. When there is only one supreme magistrate, the government is called a monarchy. So he's making a distinction\u2026very similar to Aristotle before him\u2026that the three ways we should think about how government is structured is a government by the many (democracy), government by the few, (Aristocracy) and government by one\u2026Monarchy.\u00a0\n\nSo its important to note that Rousseau doesn't think there is one end all, be all correct answer for what the best form of government is. But he does think that certain types of government lend themselves to certain situations. He gives several ground rules\u2026generally he thinks that the more people you're dealing with, the fewer number of people should be making all the decisions. So to put it simply he thinks that large societies are best off with a monarchy, medium sized states are best off with an aristocracy and small states are better off with a democracy\u2026you know our hunter gatherer tribe of fifty people where every citizen votes on every meaningful issue.\n\nBut just because Rousseau thinks that certain types of government lend themselves to certain types of societies, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a favorite form of government\u2026.and it DEFINITELY doesn't mean that when he's looking at these different options for how a government is structured that he doesn't see glaring problems with the way certain ones are designed.\n\nCase in point: Democracy. For us on the island, now that we've decided that we NEED a system of government, our next task is to find out what it's going to look like\u2026well what if we chose to have a democracy? What are the problems with that? What would Rousseau be warning us about if we chose a democracy as our form of government?\u00a0\n\nWell, to put it short: he doesn't really like democracy. He thinks its one of these things that sounds great in theory but whenever its put into practice, things never really go that well. And let's all keep in mind before you start sending in the emails that Rousseau is not talking about democracy as most people think of it today\u2026hes not talking about a system where we elect people to who sit on a panel and make decisions for us\u2026he's talking about a system where the citizens themselves are the people sitting on the panel making the decisions. Most of if not all of them.\u00a0\n\nHe says, \"there has never been a true democracy, and there never will be.\" He gives a few reasons\u2026one big issue he has is that simply by structuring society in this way\u2026 you are fighting an uphill battle from the start. He says that governments\u2026.by nature\u2026always deviate towards having less people in charge than more people in charge.\n\nIf we lived in a world where no one was ambitious, or greedy or power hungry then there would be nothing to worry about, but as the world exists now, eventually that power that was originally spread across all of the citizens\u2026 will become funneled down into a smaller group of people and then a smaller group of people until eventually the democracy is either a complete sham or ceases to exist altogether. This is why he thinks it is suited to smaller populations\u2026it's not that Rousseau thinks democracy can't be implemented\u2026its just a very volatile system of government once its in place.\u00a0\n\nNot to mention the fact, another big problem with a democracy to Rousseau is the fact that it doesn't do a very good job at accomplishing what HE thinks is one of the most important goals that a government should have: to maximize and insure the freedom of the citizens. Rousseau would say, sure it SOUNDS great that every citizen gets to be part of the decision making process\u2026no one is ever going to feel like they're not included\u2026but just think of what that means for you.\u00a0\n\nIs that REALLY what you want? Do you REALLY want to be a full time politician or a congressman ON TOP of having a full time job and a family and doing everything else you need to do to be a citizen of the government? Think about it on the island\u2026do you really want to go out in the blistering sun all day collecting coconuts and firewood and trying to get enough food to survive for the day and then come back to your makeshift shack\u2026you know this hovel that you've constructed\u2026set down your work tools, do an about face\u2026march on down to where we congregate to make the decisions on the island and put on your politician hat for the rest of the day\u2026Is that the life you want?\n\nNow the only reason I'm framing it this way is because Rousseau thinks, and we can understand where he's coming from, that if part of the reason we have this government to begin with is that we want a sort of freedom insurance\u2026this design of a government doesn't leave us much freedom to work with when its all said and done.\u00a0\n\nNow on the other side of the spectrum is a monarchy\u2026.and it probably wont come as a surprise to you people that Rousseau doesn't like the idea of a Monarchy very much either. Just like a democracy\u2026its not that it could NEVER work\u2026its not that its impossible to imagine it being a good form of government for a period of time, On the surface its great\u2026Oh look, one really smart, altruistic guy making all of the decisions! Talk about efficiency! There will never be any sort of bipartisan gridlock, executive power will run smoothly and quickly\u2026things will always get done. But again, Rousseau thinks\u2026its one of those things that sounds good in theory but when put into practice there's always problems that rear their ugly heads.\n\nAgain, if there weren't any ambitious, greedy or power hungry people in the world, this system of government may be perfect\u2026but as long as you have an inordinate amount of power in the hands of one person\u2026as long as what the government sees as best is restricted to what one, single person sees as best\u2026you're setting yourself up for failure. Not only because that person might end up being a Hitler or a Stalin or a Mao, but also because their decision making is always going to be limited to one set of experiences. One guy can't be an expert on every subject\u2026you can be an expert on one\u2026MAYBE two if you're really smart\u2026but if you ever run across anyone who always has the answer to any question you ask them\u2026they're probably pretending and in desperate need of therapy.\u00a0\n\nYou know\u2026the idea that a monarchy isn't the way to go probably isn't going to take much convincing of you during our time period, but it was a tougher sell during Rousseau's time. Just to run through a couple of his reasons for the sake of being comprehensive\u2026Rousseau talks about how one guy can't do every job, so what he's going to have to do is appoint princes and officials and people to oversee all the various aspects of a kingdom, but he's appointing him with that limited set of experiences\u2026and usually appointing people that promote HIS agenda, not necessarily the person that's the most qualified.\n\nI'm sure we've all had a dead end job with terrible management that's given the promotion not to the most qualified person, but the person that goes along with whatever their plan is. Well what happens in that case? The company starts running less efficiently, people start resenting these \"appointed officials\" and whatever the function of the business is\u2026it starts doing it worse than before. These are the kind of problems Rousseau thought were inevitable for a Monarchy\u2026and to extend this example he also thought that because of this \"ruler\" dynamic \u2026a Monarchy is never going to have a clear vision or goal for any length of time. The reason why is because If the vision or goal is restricted to the will of ONE person with a crown on his head\u2026when a NEW monarch takes the throne he is going to have a different agenda than the last guy\u2026and then think of all the wasted effort during the last 50 years to try to enact the last kings agenda. It's a mess\u2026and we can easily imagine all of these things going wrong on the island. We\u2019re probably not electing a supreme leader to deal with everything for us and Rousseau does a really good job in helping us imagine what might go wrong.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor all these reasons and more, this is why Rousseau's favorite form of government would be an Aristocracy, a government by the few. Don't confuse this with how we typically use the word in modern times, where it might refer to a handful of rich or culturally elite people running the show\u2026no\u2026Rousseau would have been using the word Aristocracy the same way that the Greeks used it where it literally translates to \"rule of the best\". \u00a0Or the rule by a handful of people who are the best to rule.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow there are three types of Aristocracies to Rousseau, Natural Aristocracy which he paints as a sort of primitive form of government where the leaders of factions or a council of elders rules\u2026A hereditary Aristocracy\u2026the WORST form of an aristocracy to Rousseau because the rulers consist of the offspring of any one given family\u2026not much explanation needed there\u2026i mean there's no merit involved there at all\u2026just imagine getting an organ transplant by the surgeons son who never went to medical school\u2026oh well his DAD was a good surgeon! He's gotta be great too!\n\nThe best kind of Aristocracy is the third kind\u2026an elective aristocracy. The government by the few where those few\u2026are elected by the citizens. To Rousseau there is too much of an upside here to ignore.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThink about it\u2026The population can still all collectively agree upon laws and a vision that doesn't change just because some Monarch leaves office\u2026they can still elect a group of people to rule for them instead of forcing them to spend all their time being a politician\u2026and the best part of all\u2026all the ambitious, greedy or power hungry people aren't going to last very long in government because the citizens will see who they are and boot them out of office\u2026IT'S PERFECT!\n\nWell, it's far from perfect. Even THAT system of government relies on a lot of things that are far from guarantees. Not the least of which is that it relies on a properly educated populace. This is a tremendous obstacle\u2026for any system of government.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike let's say we have an elective Aristocracy on our island and I'm elected to oversee some sort of elaborate coconut production that we have going on\u2026what if I'm going behind everybody's back? What if I'm making back room deals with other people on the island where we take one out of every ten coconuts and hoard it in a cave as our own personal stash\u2026just in case if we can't find any more food? Or because I want to use those coconut resources to bribe people or trade for other things that make me more powerful?\u00a0\n\nThe point is\u2026I'm just as ambitious or greedy or power hungry as someone in another form of government\u2026I'm just more covert about it. Yeah, theoretically there is a system in place for the citizens to kick me out of office if they ever find out about this stuff\u2026but what is forcing them to investigate me? If I'm really good at hiding my corruption and greed\u2026there's never going to be a majority that oppose me\u2026there's never be enough people that know the truth about me to rally together and kick me out of office.\u00a0\n\nNot to mention, if Aristocracy directly translates to \"rule of the best\"\u2026that's kind of presumptuous don't you think?\u00a0\n\nI mean, how do we really know that we are getting the best people for the job in office? The person that we elect as the \"best\" really is just a representation of who the population THINKS is the best at the time of the election\u2026which is fine, but it's certainly not fool proof.\u00a0\n\nI mean, we've all seen someone elected to office at some level of government that we think is incompetent\u2026or corrupt\u2026or doing it for the wrong reasons. That's because even though we have the ability to elect the best people\u2026every decision\u2026 about who we think is the best for the job is based on the information that is available to the population at large\u2026 and its contingent on the fact that the people voting are truly working hard to educate themselves.\u00a0\n\nThink about it\u2026even on a deserted island you need to filter information\u2026you need to try to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the information you're getting about the people that you're electing to govern. There's gonna be gossip. There's gonna be biases. There's gonna be misinformation\u2026conjecture\u2026jealously\u2026agendas. If you're thinking about voting for me to be in charge of the coconut production\u2026one person says I'm trustworthy\u2026another says I'm the devil incarnate and a secret member of the KGB\u2026who do you trust? How can you know who to trust? Let\u2019s think about the challenges we face when choosing this elective aristocracy as our form of government on our island.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis task is difficult enough on a small island with a few thousand people\u2026and now consider it in the context of our modern world. Think of the access to information that we all have. For any political issue that you could possibly think of\u2026no matter how confident you are\u2026no matter how many statistics you can point to\u2026no matter how much history reinforces what you think the correct decision is\u2026in today's day and age you face a unique challenge. You can go on Google and find hundreds of people that are just as confident as you are while arguing the other side of the issue\u2026and they point to different statistics and different moments in history to strengthen their point.\u00a0\n\nNow don't misunderstand me here\u2026that doesn't mean that both positions are equally valid\u2026obviously that's ridiculous\u2026but what it does do is cloud the waters and make it a lot more difficult..or at least time consuming to know what the truth is. So what people end up doing, and on one hand you cant really blame them for it\u2026is deem one source or a handful of sources as authoritative\u2026and trust them.\u00a0\n\nFox news, MSNBC\u2026just a large scale example of what I'm talking about \u2026.they both have a very clear agenda that they're peddling that isn't really based on reality on realities terms. But let's say you make the case that you've found a collection of sources that inform you about political events that are COMPLETELY unbiased, which would be very difficult if not impossible\u2026they are still giving you a completely unbiased account of only one piece of the truth. A facsimile of the truth.\u00a0\n\nThe reason why is because\u2026 No one source can possibly know everything there is to know about a single issue. And that's not only because they are limited as human beings with a finite number of experiences and flawed senses, but also because of things that aren't their fault at all. What they're telling you could be limited because certain pieces of information are just not made available to the public. You know\u2026just an example\u2026let's say there's some new crisis afoot\u2026look I know this is going to take a strong imagination\u2026but let's pretend the United States is thinking about taking military action somewhere\u2026boots on the ground\u2026there's a presidential election coming up and you want to educate yourself on this issue and make sure that you're choosing the right guy with the right plan at the right time for this crisis our nation is going to have to face.\n\nWell even if you spent every second of your life educating yourself on this crisis\u2026even if your TV screen was a constant loop of Bill O'reilly\u2026Rachel Maddow\u2026Al Jazeera\u2026even if you went online and read dozens of blogs and articles and opinion pieces and you consumed every PIXEL of content available on the issue. You would be the educated guy in your office. You would be the most educated guy in your city\u2026but you would still only have\u2026 a solid idea of the information that is available to the public. You know\u2026we talk about the veil of perception\u2026this is the veil of classification. This information is classified\u2026all of the Intel\u2026all of the stuff they see on satellites\u2026the decades of history of what is actually said behind the scenes when we've made agreements\u2026\n\nYou can't possibly know any of this stuff\u2026yet\u2026you are the most qualified to be voting and everyone around you watched a 30 minute special on Bill O'reilly last night and feel super confident that they know the right guy for the job is and exactly the plan that needs to be put in place.\u00a0\n\nNow this may seem like a tangent but it all comes back full circle. Rousseau would warn us on our island about the potential downfalls of a democracy and a monarchy, but even his favorite form of government, the elective aristocracy is riddled with problems\u2026one of the most glaring is this problem of educating the populace. If we allow the average citizen to vote and elect members of this aristocracy, we better hope that a world exists where those citizens \u2026at LEAST\u2026have access to education. And as we just pointed out\u2026even if we give those citizens education\u2026the problems don't stop there. It starts to raise the question of whether the average citizen is the right person to determine who their leaders are.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI always say that voting for president in today's world is like choosing your wife by looking at two online dating profiles that were written by their mothers. The online dating profiles represent the only information we have to work with\u2026things like articles or news reports\u2026and the mothers that have an obvious bias in one direction are people like Fox News\u2026MSNBC.\u00a0\n\nThe point is\u2026when it comes to the structure of government\u2026we are by no means at any sort of evolutionary end point here\u2026but we still have to choose one for our island. And in keeping with Rousseau\u2026let's move ahead with caution. Let's make our island government an Elective Aristocracy and keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses. Because as we continue to add layers to our new society and it becomes increasingly complex, us understanding the function of each ingredient in this cupcake recipe is going to make a big difference. \u00a0Thank you for listening\u2026I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_41": {"date": "2015-1-3", "text": "Posted on January 3, 2015\ntest\n\nstephen resume\n\nEpisodio 1-Filosofia Jonica\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_42": {"date": "2015-1-9", "text": "Posted on January 9, 2015\nEpisode 47 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #047 on The General Will. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo our ship crashed.\n\nWe're on an island with no hope of rescue. We've decided that having a government is more beneficial that NOT having a government, and we've decided that the structure of the government is going to be Rousseau's favorite kind: the elective Aristocracy. Now what? Well to answer that question, I want to ask you a question. When was the last time you went to Ikea? I'm serious\u2026when was the last time you waddled through that giant\u2026maze that they make you go through? It's like being a rat in a maze, but instead of looking for cheese you're looking for a cheap coffee table. You know\u2026you sit down in all those different pre-constructed living rooms and you imagine yourself, if only for a moment, having a different life\u2026one where you felt alive again. The reason I'm asking is because whenever you buy one of these cheap coffee tables they come with two things: the parts you need to build the thing\u2026and the instructions on how to put it together\u2026you know they don't use any words because they don't want to print a different set of instructions for every language, so they try to harness a universal language across all humans and apparently that language uses a lot of arrows and happy faces. The point is, we've talked about the different parts of government\u2026the coffee table comes with wood, screws, an Allen wrench, all the things you'd need to build it. We've talked about how the different parts of government are assembled\u2026the coffee table comes with the universal picture instruction manual. But nothing in the coffee table package tells you what the function of your coffee table should be. Nobody at Ikea is going to tell you what to do with your coffee table once you've assembled all the parts. And if the function of a coffee table is to hold coasters and novelty books that no one reads\u2026what is the function of our island government? What the heck do we want this thing to do for us? Thomas Hobbes said it was the maintain order. John Locke said it was to protect our natural rights of life, liberty and property\u2026and Rousseau said it was to serve the general will of the people\u2026.now\u2026at first glance it may seem pretty obvious what he means here. Oh, general will\u2026that just means its the governments job to do what everyone wants them to do\u2026right? Well\u2026it's not that simple. And really, what did you expect from philosophy? Especially when it comes down to so many moving parts\u2026I mean think about it. It's hard enough to try to take into account the thoughts of every single citizen equally\u2026but then from there to try to distill it down into one thing the government can act upon\u2026i mean come on! That's just ASKING for every philosopher and their mom to try to criticize you\u2026and that's exactly what happened. This concept of what the general will is and how to adequately arrive at\u2026 it is one of the most commented on things in the history of political philosophy\u2026and there's far from a clear answer when it comes to knowing exactly what Rousseau was talking about. It can even at times be downright confusing. But by looking at the different arguments and by understanding what makes it confusing, we can all arrive at a solid understanding of what the general will is\u2026ALBEIT an imperfect understanding, but a better understanding then most people and definitely a better understanding than someone who claims to KNOW for certain \u2026what Rousseau was talking about in the 1700's. So to get started\u2026There's not just one thing that's unclear about Rousseau's concept of the \"general will\". Now, as I said, this is one of the most commented on things you could find from Rousseau..and once everybody said their piece, if you wanted to identify one of the big areas of confusion about defining the general will\u2026it wouldn't be a bad place to start to ask the question: if what we're trying to do is take the individual wills of all the individual citizens and arrive at the common ground between them all\u2026which one of their \"wills\" should we be looking at? Rousseau talks about it at length. Think about it\u2026people are complicated. We don't just identify our self as an individual\u2026 and then ignore everything outside of that. Okay\u2026people have multiple causes that are important to them that might influence what they think they want from the government. Let's think about it in terms of our island. Aside from everything else\u2026every person on this island identifies themselves as a person\u2026an individual\u2026with needs and wants. This personal will, if they were naive enough to allow it to\u2026could shade what they think they want from their government. For example, any one person on our island could say\u2026okay\u2026you know what I want from MY government? I want to do nothing. I want there to be zero taxes. I want to never have to contribute to society in any way. I want my government to insure that I never have to work and that I will be constantly entertained for every second of my life. I want them to assign me twelve people\u2026we'll call them my disciples\u2026twelve people that follow me around and do everything for me\u2026they fan me with palm leaves\u2026they massage my feet\u2026they feed me\u2026they build a better shelter for me\u2026they collect coconuts for me\u2026that's what I want from my government. Well this is an extreme case, but you get the point. We can all imagine how someone thinking in terms of only themselves\u2026 could be led to expect things of their government that don't necessarily correspond with the common good. I mean, what an example of something that would be a massive expenditure of government resources on something that would only really benefit that one person, and stand to hurt others. This is important because the second will that Rousseau thinks we can think on behalf of\u2026the second way someone can identify themselves that would affect what they expect from their government\u2026is by identifying themselves as one part of the whole society. One citizen that wants the government to do what's best for the collective body\u2026a citizen that sets aside their own personal, selfish desires so that instead there can be a set of laws that allow all the different parts of this whole\u2026 to have an equal amount of freedom. Now\u2026in an ideal world\u2026this is how everyone would think\u2026but Rousseau says to expect people to be wise enough to always realize that this is the best way to think about your relationship to the state is just a waste of time. In the same way people can identify their will with that of everyone in a society\u2026they can also attach themselves to other groups. You know\u2026they can become a single-issue voter\u2026they can champion the cause of anti-gay marriage\u2026they can champion the cause of food-stamps for the poor\u2026they can attach themselves to a particular company that they work for or even\u2026a rival state. The point is\u2026with all these different potential \"wills\" hanging in the balance\u2026it becomes very difficult for individual citizens to come together as single pieces of an assembly and arrive at a set of laws that treat everybody equally. In other words\u2026it's tough for us as admittedly\u2026flawed human beings\u2026with biases and agendas to arrive at a set of laws that ACTUALLY reflect the general will. This is something that's extremely important for us to understand\u2026the set of laws that we agree upon on the island are a reflection of the general will of the people. It's not hard to imagine on our island\u2026 how differing values and priorities might lead to laws that unfairly restrict one person\u2026or one group of people. And this is a problem to Rousseau. you know\u2026 He says that in order for it to truly be considered the \"general will\" it must \"come from all and apply to all\"\u2026but this is much easier said than done. Even if we arrive at a place where no one group is being unfairly scrutinized\u2026this can work going the other direction too\u2026we have to create a set of laws that don't unfairly benefit one group of people over another\u2026.which would be easy in the infant stages of a society\u2026like our island government\u2026but you can imagine how much more difficult that becomes the more layers you add to this society\u2026the more complex and diverse this society gets. Like\u2026as we talked about a couple episodes ago\u2026Rousseau thinks that even something as simple as private property is impossible to make equal laws about. Because as long as one of the things we want our government to do for us is protect our private property rights\u2026that will always unequally benefit people that have more property. Much of the confusion between commentators comes down to the question: well how do we arrive at what Rousseau calls the general will? And they usually think about it in one of two ways. These two ways have become known to history as\u2026should we think of it as the \"democratic\" general will or the \"transcendental\" general will\u2026and let me explain what they mean by both. So one one hand\u2026the general will could be what results from when all the citizens come together in some sort of assembly\u2026.you know we all congregate on our island\u2026we argue, we talk about priorities\u2026we talk about values and we come to some sort of agreement about what we want that it's the government's job to execute. This is known as the \"democratic\" general will. On the other hand, the general will could be something a little more abstract. You know\u2026exterior to what any one person actually wants from the government\u2026you could make an argument that there is some general will that is transcendent of anything we could ever arrive at in an assembly. You know for example, the citizens of a state could all come together and decide that they don't want to pay a tax of .25 cents for every gallon of gas they buy, but paying that tax might ultimately be better for the common good. Which general will was Rousseau referring to? Another thing that's confusing about THIS interpretation of the general will\u2026who's job is it to determine what the general will is? Who decides what's best for the common good? If you think the general will is not democratically arrived at through an assembly of people, and that its actually some transcendent thing, whose the guy or gal that determines what that thing is? Because it's not always clear who that person is and we've tried a lot different things throughout history. Is it the strongest person who should decide? Is it the government itself? Is it the cultural elite or rich people? Is it famous celebrities? Well a lot of what makes this debate confusing is still up in the air, and we're not going to get to the bottom of it in this episode, but most commentators agree on one thing: that with the correct restrictions and operating within the correct conditions\u2026it stands to reason that citizens will be able to come together, discuss priorities and arrive at a set of laws that reflect the general will. Again\u2026this is important\u2026the laws are a reflection of the general will. On our island\u2026 the laws that we put in place are a representation of what we all collectively want from our government. And in that way\u2026we can have a working knowledge of the general will by thinking of it as: A consensus among the people about what we should do when it comes to our political, economic and social systems. So what is the government? The government is just a company that we're commissioning to carry out the general will. Really, try to think about it in that way, cause it's really easy for us to look at the government as this secretive\u2026powerful entity that is kind of like our parents. This faceless enforcer that we really have no right to question\u2026our job is to fall in line with the rules that it gives us\u2026or else. But just for a second, think about the government like it is a company that we're paying to do something for us. In the same way that you pay Dairy Queen to make you delicious ice-cream\u2026in the same way you pay Home Depot to get you home improvement supplies\u2026you pay the government to enact the general will. The reason this is an important way to think about things is because\u2026just how Dairy Queen has to compete with places like Burger King and Mcdonalds and Wendy's\u2026the government has to compete with people too. Not internally\u2026.in fact that may be the biggest criticism of government is that there isn't another government down the street you can go to if you don't like this one\u2026what I mean is that we exist in a world where every country is made up of a giant population of people that have basically commissioned a company to carry out the general will of the people. Spain has a company carrying out THEIR general will. England has a company carrying out theirs. Iran, Iraq, Russia, China, Zimbabwe\u2026the United States\u2026we all have a company\u2026and sometimes the general will of these countries\u2026the tasks these companies are commissioned to carry out\u2026sometimes they don't correspond with each other. Sometimes the consensus of the people of France when it comes to their political, economic and social systems doesn't mesh very well with what another country wants. Sometimes it creates tension. Sometimes difficult decisions need to be made. In fact, just think about something for a second. COMPLETELY setting aside how difficult of a task it is to arrive at what the general will of a given society is\u2026and understanding the fact that you're looking at a moving target\u2026i mean the general will of a society is constantly changing\u2026even if the government knew EXACTLY what the general will was, they would still have to agree upon a plan to get there. If part of the general will is to be as peaceful a nation as we can possibly be\u2026there are many different ways to arrive at the same destination\u2026for example you can create a climate of peace because you're bigger and stronger than everyone so no one wants to mess with you\u2026or you can be peaceful by just agreeing with anything any country tries to do. This is just one example, but you can see that defining the general will is only the first step\u2026then you have to agree on what path to get there. But even THAT'S not the end of it, because even if you could agree upon which path to take to get there\u2026there are still dozens if not hundreds of options of exactly how you're going to execute that path. I'd compare it to taking a road trip. Imagine everyone in the United States on a giant truck and the president is in the drivers seat. Even if they could determine where on the map we wanted to go\u2026let's say everyone wants to go to Pittsburgh\u2026he'd still have to argue with everyone about which road to take to get there. One guy says to take the interstate\u2026another person says to take the surface streets\u2026one person knows a shortcut! Someone else says that shortcut goes through the mountains and is dangerous! Let's say they decide were taking the interstate\u2026we still have to decide what sort of travel schedule were on\u2026when do we sleep? how fast do we drive? Are we even driving at all\u2026or should we walk? This example is not to be obnoxious\u2026it's just to illustrate the mountain of choices and arguments that go into even executing a single thread in this tapestry known as the general will. I would never want to be at the head of one of these companies whose job it is to execute the general will. I mean\u2026just consider for a second the kinds of decisions that these people need to make on a daily basis\u2026.even stuff that seems really easy is enough to drive me, personally into madness. Take something like the Iraq War\u2026 Widely considered to be a political blunder. Even if you agree with everything that was done and think it was fully justifiable\u2026you have to acknowledge that there is a large group of people that disagree with you. A group of people that say that history will look back on the United States invading Iraq in 2003 and think that it was a horrendous mistake in foreign policy\u2026you know\u2026it created this power vacuum and now all this stuffs going on\u2026 Well how bout a quick thought experiment. What if\u2026100 years from now\u2026something happens where it turns out the Iraq war was the greatest political chess move that ever happened. You know\u2026the dominoes that were set in motion because of the Iraq War eventually made possible something that ushered in 10,000 years of world peace\u2026obviously corresponding perfectly with the general will of the united states? What then? Now I'm not justifying these actions by saying that something good MAY happen down the line\u2026I'm not saying it would have been planned\u2026I'm not saying George Bush is like the Rain man and he was 25 steps ahead of anyone else when he made the decision to do it\u2026what I'm saying is that the decisions that we make today on behalf of the General will don't just affect us today\u2026or tomorrow or even a year from now\u2026but centuries. If part of the general will is to protect the united states and it's allies\u2026because in modern times you need allies to win any sort of major war\u2026what happens when Britain is attacked? What is it like to be at the top of one of these companies that we've commissioned to carry out the general will? At what point is stepping in militarily going to yield more peace in the long term than staying out of it would have? Will it jeopardize our relationship with any other countries? What are the economic implications of this 10, 20 100 years down the line? You can just imagine an ENDLESS decision tree that these people have to take into account\u2026an endless number of scenarios\u2026if this happens and they respond that way\u2026then we do this.. and they're doing all of this with a single goal in mind: the common good. what is the absolute best decision we can make that promotes the general will? By the way\u2026these problems are not just on a global scale when we're dealing with the threat of war\u2026these things happen domestically all the time\u2026for example: the illegal immigration debate. On one hand you have the human side of it\u2026how horrible is it that by no fault of this person\u2026this person didn't have a choice\u2026simply by virtue of being born on one side of an arbitrary line in the sand that we drew 200 years ago\u2026this person will live a completely different life than someone born 100 feet away on the other side of this line. Across the board they will have fewer and worse opportunities available to them simply because they were born 100 feet in the wrong direction. It's terrible\u2026and this fact leads certain people to advocate an open borders policy. You know\u2026who are we to tell someone where they can or can't live like we OWN THE EARTH or something? These people say if someone wants to live here\u2026let them live here! We can totally see where these people are coming from\u2026and how could the government be mad at them? They're compassionate people! But it's also easy to see the governments side of an open borders policy. You know\u2026when we think of the government as just a company that we've commissioned to do a job for us\u2026what are they going to do to make sure the job gets done? What would any of you guys do? If the government has ever actually considered a policy of completely open borders\u2026I can imagine them as an entity commissioned to do a job going back and looking at history. Finding examples of governments that have been rich and in turn\u2026given out a lot of stuff for free to its citizens. Then they look to see if that combined with having a lax immigration policy has ever led to problems down the road. Can you give citizenship to every single person that wants it? They probably look around them and see that every developed country has criteria that someone has to meet before they're granted citizenship. Why is that the case? We can see them having these sorts of discussions saying look, we have one job that was assigned to us\u2026and our choices don't necessarily need to make everyone in the entire world happy\u2026ultimately its the general will we're concerned with. Again, the point of all this is not to say that its impossible to make these decisions\u2026its not to say that we shouldn't be making these decisions. It's just to help us understand the task at hand. The general will, whatever that thing is, is a tough thing to get a hold of\u2026and even if you can grab a hold of it\u2026you gotta agree upon a path to get there\u2026you have to choose from all the options and find the best strategy to execute that path\u2026 and also consider a million different other factors that might make your decision a bad one in the long run. Let's all consider the monumental task that we ask of our government. This collection of people\u2026this company that we've commissioned to do this job for us. Whether we like it or not\u2026we live in a world of competing nation-states. Most of the time we get along, but sometimes the goals of one nation-state don't correspond with another\u2026and difficult decisions need to be made. This is just\u2026reality. All I'm saying, is that when it comes to being one of the people making the decisions on our island, I would NEVER want to be one of those people. To be at the top of this company that we've commissioned\u2026you have to be a pretty incredible person if you're doing your job properly. We're going to need to work really hard on our island.. to find a collection of the most incredible people that we got, because if we take that task lightly\u2026 we could easily end up dead. Think of how much is at stake on the island, these people are going to be making the decisions while our lives hang in the balance. And the most terrifying part of all\u2026is that this isn't just a thought experiment. It's easy to be cavalier about this situation when were playing make believe about being stranded on an island, but back in reality are things really different? Think about the way that we elect leaders in today's world: You look around you and you see so many single issue voters\u2026so many people voting based on about thirty minutes of actual research\u2026you look at the direct connection between campaign advertising dollars spent vs elections won\u2026you know your character doesn't need to have merit at all\u2026as long as you can run more ads than your opponent\u2026all it takes is a commercial to influence who humans vote for. You see people voting for people because of what letter is next to the persons name\u2026or what gender they are\u2026or what ethnic background they're from\u2026that's my favorite: YOUR ancestors had sex in a similar geographic proximity to MY ancestors. I like you! You must be the right kind of person to be making these massive decisions on behalf of the entire population. Here's the keys to the entire civilization. Here's the keys to the wealth of our nation. And on that note I will leave you until next time when we talk about an economist that would have a lot to say about this island nation that we're building that finally has a government. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_43": {"date": "2015-1-17", "text": "Posted on January 17, 2015\nEpisode 48 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #048 on Specialization. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, funny story. I was at a sports bar the other day and embarrassed myself. You know\u2026I walked into the place\u2026loud music\u2026a hundred plus TVs plastering the walls\u2026all playing different sports games\u2026and the place was completely empty. Like, I was truly the ONLY guy in the entire bar\u2026and I walk up to the counter and I sit down and a nice gentleman behind the counter greets me\u2026 And I don't know\u2026I didn't realize it as I was doing it\u2026but I guess as I was soaking in this really crazy atmosphere I was looking around and smiling. And the bartender guy comes up to me and he says something like, Hey look at this guy! He's feelin' good right now! Why you smilin' man? I said, I can't really think of a good reason NOT to be smiling right now. I'm happy! And he says, why are you happy? I say back\u2026because I'm talking to you right now in this wonderful place. And he get's this serious look on his face and he leans in and says, but no, really\u2026WHY are you happy? Now at this point I'm like\u2026oh my god. This guy's a philosopher! This is the Socrates of the Buffalo Wild Wings! He finds people, asks them why they're happy and then tries to really get to the bottom of what makes them grateful to be alive! I like this guy\u2026and at this point I decide to go into the more honest, FULL answer cause I think this guy isn't satisfied with my disingenuous, non-philosophical answer. So I give him it. I say, you know what it is? I feel like a King right now. In fact, I feel like one of the most privileged kings that has ever lived in the history of man. I just look at my life and I compare what I have at my disposal with what every other generation of humans have had at their disposal and It's impossible not to be smiling. I mean think about it in the context of this one piece of my day. I drove my giant metal horse down here\u2026it took me five minutes. Except it has the power of 200 horses and I can go anywhere I want on a moments notice. I come here to your fine establishment that is well-lit, and safe, and clean and a servant takes my request for what my professional chef is going to prepare for my cheat meal that week. By the way, there's SUCH an abundance of high calorie, professionally prepared food around me that I have to limit myself to one meal a week so that I don't eat myself to death. I sit here waiting for my chef-prepared food and I am constantly entertained by these magic boxes all around. Think about it: 500 channels all competing for my attention, they have a team of people\u2026constantly honing their programming, fine tuning things trying to create the best product they possibly can\u2026 so that I watch THEIR channel instead of the other 499 channels\u2026and if I'm bored of these I can go on the internet\u2026an ENDLESS SEA of entertainment competing for my eyeballs. Youtube videos, blogs, podcasts all vying for my attention. And right now, my newest friend, I've chosen to watch sports. I don't even watch sports that much\u2026and despite that\u2026this guy on the TV has been killing himself ALL WEEK LONG for my benefit. This guy's been running laps, lifting weights and pushing his body to it's extreme all week during practice to get to a place where he can show up on Saturday and not just try to perform well\u2026but try to put on the BEST PERFORMANCE he's ever put on in his life\u2026He's going to try to do SUPER HUMAN things so that I will be entertained. So I'm happy and I'm smiling because I feel like a King right now. I'm not rich by society's standards, and yet all of this stuff is available to me on a moments notice. I can't think of a single King from human history that wouldn't trade lives with me in a heartbeat. That's why I'm happy. And the guy says back to me, Yeah\u2026I've heard that you can take like 500 dollars and live like a King for a day in a country like Nicaragua. Well in the moment I felt like taking my own life. I felt like beating my head into the granite bar until I was a senseless vegetable in the hospital. But it was all my fault. This guy just wanted to have a normal conversation\u2026I'm the one that assumed he wanted to hear all the twisted thoughts going through my head in a given moment. This guy may not have been interested, but the sentiment of what I'm saying here is definitely not going to be lost on my closest friends. You guys. In fact, what I'm talking about here is something that the famous economist Adam Smith would have a lot to say about. Adam Smith is one of these enlightenment age philosophers that made his name in the field of economics. Now, just how the enlightenment as a whole is characterized by a fundamental questioning of assumptions that we had made in the past about different elements of living, You know\u2026Rousseau questions government\u2026Voltaire questions the churches moral authority\u2026etc\u2026Adam Smith is the most famous guy in this period that tackled the field of economics. Now, the conventional wisdom that Adam Smith is calling into question here in the area of economics\u2026is what is known today as Mercantilism. We're going to be talking a lot about Mercantilism in the next episode of the podcast when we talk about what it means to be a wealthy nation\u2026were going to apply it to our society that we're building\u2026while stranded on an island\u2026but today we're going to be talking about what it means to be a wealthy person. What does it mean to be a wealthy person? How do you measure wealth? Ideally, I think we'd all agree that if were creating a society\u2026one thing we might want to at least consider is a strategy for creating as many wealthy people as we possibly can. So how do we do it best? You know it's funny, when most of us think of wealth\u2026we think of it in terms of how much money someone has in the bank\u2026or what their net-worth is if you combined all their assets. But is some dollar figure like that really a complete way of assessing wealth? Now I'm not saying the dollar figure doesn't matter at all\u2026it certainly DOES matter\u2026all I'm saying is that this is idea of wealth is a big topic and by only looking at the dollar figure, you're only looking at one little piece of this discussion. Maybe a good place to start the discussion is to ask the question: What does $1 buy you in today's world? Maybe the better way of looking at it so it translates well across different time periods is ask the question what do you get for one hour of work today, as opposed to fifty years ago. 100 years ago. 200 years ago. This is how things work: we trade hours of our work for money. We use this money to buy things that we want, but how wealthy we consider ourselves..is directly related to how much that money buys us. You know, I'm sure we've all heard the example\u2026well you have a million dollars and I have a cheeseburger\u2026if we're stranded on a desert island with nothing to spend money on, who is richer? Let's look at one example. One of the things we want to spend our money on is light. We want our house to be well lit so that we can actually do things\u2026and most importantly you don't want to be walking through your house in the dark and stub your toe on a chair or an end table\u2026it hurts. Let's look back to the year 1800. In the year 1800 the primary means if you wanted to conjure up some light was a candle. If you wanted to buy a candle from the store\u2026that burned and created one hour of light for you in the year 1800, one hour of light to read your old English philosophical text\u2026that candle would cost you the equivalent of six hours of your work. Now just 80 years later in the 1880's\u2026with the advent of the kerosene lamp making the conjuring of light much more efficient, to get that exact same hour of light to read your 1880's Victorian era magazine would cost you the equivalent of 15 minutes of work. In the 1950's, one hour of light took you eight seconds to earn and in the twenty first century you earn what you need to earn to conjure up one hour of light in just over half a second. In 200 years, the efficiency of your work hours in this small area has improved by 43,200 times. Really, this whole situation doesn't really matter as far as the average person is concerned. Not many people think about their level of wealth in terms of how it compares to the way people lived 200 years ago\u2026they think about how they stack up against everybody else in modern times, their friends\u2026neighbors. If everybody had a castle in modern times, it would be common for people to be complaining that they only have a castle and not a helicopter pad like their next door neighbor. But it's interesting to ask: why does this dynamic exist? In the area of producing light\u2026why are we 43,200 times wealthier than someone living 200 years ago? There are a number of reasons but two of the biggest are technological innovation\u2026you know over the years we've just invented better and better ways of generating light\u2026and this has been done by people who specialize in the field of light generation\u2026if that's what you want to call it. Technological innovation and specialization. These two things are intertwined. \u2026People specializing in a certain field leads to technological innovation\u2026and then the people that specialize in this new innovation create NEW technological innovations. It's a vicious cycle\u2026but a cycle that makes living as an average citizen in the 21st century better than living like a monarch did in the year 1800. And this specialization and the enormously beneficial effects it has on society is something that Adam Smith talks about at length. He uses the example of pins. Not a pen that you write with\u2026a metal pin that you use to sew stuff and stab people\u2026whatever you do with a pin. He says that before humans began specializing in stuff we were doing things REALLY inefficiently. He gives the example of one guy\u2026you know\u2026if one guy decides he's setting out today to make a bunch of pins for his family. That guy has an absolutely giant task ahead of him. Adam Smith talks about how even when we consider something that seems as basic and simple as a pin there are multiple different steps to making it. You gotta lay out the strip of metal. You gotta cut the pin down to size. You gotta sharpen the pin. You gotta buff the pin down to something shiny that isn't going to create friction when you're sewing. You gotta poke the hole at the top of the pin. Adam Smith lays out over a dozen steps that go into the making just one single pin\u2026and if this one single guy spends his day making pins\u2026Adam Smith says he'd be lucky to complete even ONE pin. Think of all the transition time. Think of how inefficiently he's doing all the steps. Think of all the mistakes he stands to make or the unrefined system that he's using on any one step. I mean, we can all relate to what Adam Smith is talking about here. Spend a day trying to make anything around your house and you'll see what I'm saying. You don't make spoons for a living. For you to try to do all the stuff associated with spoon making by yourself\u2026is just an inefficient use of your time, and if this seems obvious to you now, it wasn't back in the time of Adam Smith. He offers an alternative to having one guy spend his entire day trying to make pins\u2026 by looking at a pin making factory. An operation that dedicates each day specializing in pins. Instead of one person doing all the steps themselves, a different person would specialize in each of the different steps. One person would specialize in laying out the metal, one person would specialize in cutting the metal, one person would specialize in putting the little hole in the top. You guys get the point. Adam Smith says that by his estimation, while the single guy making pins.. only makes one pin per day\u2026this team of specialists\u2026when humans are working together..could make almost 50,000 pins in a day. And when you look at it that way\u2026the potential benefits to growing society are just obvious. Think about it in terms of our growing society\u2026our island. How do we want to do things? Well, one option is to have a bunch of people going at it alone. Thousands of individual, subsistent people all providing for themselves and whenever they need anything to make their lives more livable, they have to make it themselves. Because these people have to make everything and can never specialize in making any one thing, what they end up with is a relegated version of everything\u2026at least when compares to what they could have if the society adopted an attitude of specialization. I'd compare it to a Swiss Army Knife. Like, when you have one person that makes a knife and a nail file and a corkscrew and a GPS machine and all the stuff that comes on one of those things\u2026you could just buy a good knife from somebody that makes knives and a good nail file from someone that makes nail files, but instead you get a mediocre knife, a bad nail file and those little scissors that\u2026Who are these Swiss army people and do they really think anyone has ever used those scissors for anything? Have you ever seen those. Like what am I\u2026am I giving haircuts to insects or something? Why do I need these little scissors? My point is, life pre and post specialization is a very different place. What if instead of living individual, subsistent lifestyles on this island we all find something that we think is going to be useful for everyone and specialize in making it? And throughout this process of specializing in making something\u2026 you're going to develop new systems and new technology that makes your job of creating this thing better designed and more efficient. Eventually, you have a stockpile of these things that you make\u2026that are useful to everyone in society\u2026 and you go around trading for the stuff that OTHER people specialized in, which in turn will be created with a better design, more efficiency and a higher quality than you could do if you did it yourself. This is all very awesome and very straightforward, but probably the MOST awesome and revolutionary thing about this small section of Adam Smith's thought, is that it creates that vicious cycle that we were talking about. Think about it, people are willingly living their lives each day\u2026improving the world that we live in\u2026not because they're Gandhi or some particularly altruistic person or because a King is forcing them to\u2026 but out of their own self-interest! This was MASSIVE at the time. Political philosophers before this time talked all the time about what the duty of a citizen was to their country. Part of this duty, historically, was always to quell their vices. You know, if you want to indulge in too much of any one kind of pleasure, you owe it to your fellow citizens and country, as one cog in this giant machine\u2026to dial it back a bit. For example, you may love bread. You may want to eat 100 loaves of bread in a day. But that might not be the best thing for society. When you go to the bakery and do your best impression of the cookie monster and eat 100 loaves of bread, there may not be enough bread for the rest of the people that need to eat that day. But in Adam Smith's new way of looking at things, people's vices can actually serve to benefit society as a whole. This was giant. For example, what if this person loves bread so much that they decide to specialize in bread making. What if they want to find a way to create a bread surplus so that they can still have their 100 loaves of bread a day while everyone else gets theirs too? And this person takes their bread really seriously\u2026they only want the softest, tastiest bread with the perfect golden brown crust and their new system makes that a reality on every single loaf? The point is: there's a self interested motivation there for improving bread production and it has nothing to do with waiting around for some altruistic person to build a better mousetrap. That strange vice that you have for eating mice is the thing that motivates you to build the better mousetrap. And this is a simple but crucial shift to Adam Smith. He talks about bargains. He famously said that Man is an animal that makes bargains\u2026and what he means by that is that it is a uniquely human characteristic to trade useful things for other useful things. I mean, you don't see zebras trading grass or beavers trading supplies for building their dams. No, it is a HUMAN characteristic to make bargains\u2026and one of the most common tactics that we use to try to get what we want from the other person is by appealing to their self-interest. You know, you say here's the reason why it benefits you greatly to make this deal with me. Now note the distinction here\u2026we aren't begging this person to give us what we want by appealing to their altruism. We aren't asking them to make this bargain because it would be a really nice thing for you to do for me and it would make my day\u2026 We tell them that the way they can have this thing that they want is to give you what you want. And this process, while done on a small scale with these individual transactions, is simultaneously being done on a large scale with society. We don't wait around for some knight in shining armor to create the iPhone for us\u2026 you know\u2026I'm doing this so that people can text each other and finally be happy! No, Steve Jobs builds a team of people that creates the iPhone for self-interested reasons\u2026whatever reason it may be\u2026maybe he wanted glory\u2026maybe he wanted to go down in history as someone that drastically improved the lives of billions of people. Who knows\u2026and Adam Smith's point is who cares? His vice of wanting to be put down in the annals of history ultimately is a great thing for everyone. As humans, as soon as we realized that we could make these bargains with each other that are in the self-interest of both parties involved\u2026that led to a massive change. Because now, every single person doesn't need to be self-sufficient. So what does it mean to be a wealthy person? Let's go back to the beginning of the episode with my overly-sanctimonious proclamation that I made at the alter of Buffalo Wild Wings to the bartender. This long explanation for why I'm happy, referencing all this stuff\u2026is honestly just a love sonnet written to Adam Smith's writing on the benefits of specialization and these self-interested bargains that humans make. Think about it: one of the things I talked about was the professional sports player\u2026this guy that spends his days running laps, eating a perfectly clean diet and pushing his body to it's physical limits simply so that I can sit down in my modern day Colosseum and be \"entertained\" by the show he's putting on for me. Well, in reality, that's not what's happening at all. This guy doesn't even know who I am\u2026couldn't care less about me. The reason HE'S doing all this stuff is because it's in his self-interest to. Maybe he loves his job\u2026he loves playing the game. Maybe he is doing it because he likes the idea of making 20 million dollars a year. Maybe he's doing it to etch his name in the sports history books and become immortalized as a star. There are a lot of reasons why he could be doing it, but effectively\u2026to me\u2026it doesn't matter. I'm still living the life of a King that has people training all day every day to put on a show for me at the end of the week. In fact, I would say the show that self-interest and specialization produces is actually much better than anything a King could get. Let's consider the alternative. Let's say I was a ruthless monarch in the 1500's and I could somehow gaze into the future and see the life that Stephen West has in the year 2015\u2026and I decide that I too want a bunch of people doing a grueling training regimen so that I have a show to watch on the weekend. Let's say that as King, I take 1500 people, force them to train all week long and I call this group of people the NFL. I'm still getting a vastly inferior product than what we're getting in 2015. First of all, they have no motivation to push their bodies to the absolute max\u2026when you remove the meritocracy of professional sports there's no reason for them to try as hard as they can, I mean why risk long term injury? They aren't going to like what they're doing\u2026that's going to shine through. The game is just going to be less exciting all around. Consider for a second just how incredible it is that not only do we get a better product in 2015, but these professional athletes aren't doing this job because they're forced to\u2026or because they are altruistic\u2026you know\u2026competing because they're nice guys that want society to have something to entertain them. We don't have to wait around for any of that\u2026they do it because it is in their own self-interest to give everything they have in this area they specialize in. By the way, this applies to EVERYTHING from that long-winded example I gave to the bartender. Cars, buildings, light fixtures, professionally prepared food, bar stools, TV's, entertainment channels, TV shows and yes even sports stars. Just a few short generations ago, people would look at what we have at our fingertips on a daily basis and think that we were God-Kings. That\u2026is pretty incredible. And it's only possible because of things like specialization and the self-interested bargains that we make with each other. So the takeaway from this is that when we're shipwrecked on an island\u2026TV and movies have kind of shaded our expectations of how we expect things to go once we have to fend for ourselves. It's very easy to imagine us all living individual, subsistent lifestyles just trying to collect enough stuff to survive from day to day. But if we apply these basic ideas from Adam Smith\u2026things might not be that bad for very long. Because by us working together with each other\u2026eight hours of you working hard might not produce one pin\u2026but closer to the 50,000 number. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_44": {"date": "2015-1-26", "text": "Posted on January 26, 2015\nEpisode 49 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #049 on Adam Smith. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nToday's episode of Philosophize This! begins in a very normal city in the southern deserts of Arizona known as Nogales. If you walked through the streets of Nogales, Arizona\u2026depending on which part of it you were walking through, you wouldn't think it was much different than where ever you live currently. You would see families and houses and children playing\u2026but in this otherwise unassuming city lies a question\u2026a question that may be the most fundamental question we, as humans could ever ask about civilization itself. And to the citizens of Nogales, Arizona this question stares them in the face\u2026day after day.\nBecause what you would see if I took you up onto the hillside of Nogales, Arizona\u2026you know\u2026the topography of the area is such where there is a hilly, mountain-like region that acts like sort of a crown around the head of the city where you can get a pretty good line of sight in all directions\u2026what you would see on the right hand side is the beautiful city of Nogales, Arizona in the United States. And then as your eyes scan to the left you would see about fifty feet of cleared path, a small, flimsy fence\u2026sort of poetically illustrating how flimsy these lines are that we draw\u2026and then on the left hand side of this fence you will see the city of Nogales. But this isn't Nogales, Arizona\u2026this is Nogales, Sonora in the republic of Mexico.\u00a0\nI'm serious! There's even a picture you can look up and see it\u2026I'll put it on the episode page at philosophizethis.org\u2026because apparently that's what you do when you're a podcaster\u2026and it's a picture from this very hillside\u2026\nNow, physically speaking this is the exact same town\u2026as far as physical barriers are concerned its only separated by about fifty feet and a flimsy fence. The REAL separation between these two geographic areas\u2026 lies in the lives of the average citizens that have to LIVE in these different areas.\u00a0\nThe average citizen of Nogales, Arizona has life\u2026 really good by global standards. The average income is around $30,000 per year. Everyone has access to roads that lead to neighboring towns that aren't crumbling. They have electrical lines, phone lines, a sewer system, public education\u2026not to mention a functioning police department where the laws of the land are actually enforced. The bottom line is\u2026 people living in Nogales, Arizona\u2026 live their lives everyday feeling as though the government is working for them, not the other way around. They don't live their lives in constant fear of being assaulted or robbed or extorted or any other of our favorite pastimes. \u00a0\nNow just a few steps away, the average citizen in the city of Nogales, Mexico is much different. The average income here is about $10,000 per year. Yes, people have access to public education\u2026 but the quality of that education is severely worse. Couple that with the fact that most of the people living here have to drop out of school early on just to earn enough money to try to rub two pennies together\u2026 and what you're left with is a city where the majority of people over the age of 18 don't have a high school diploma.\u00a0\nAcross the board\u2026 the health of the citizens is far worse than their Arizonian neighbors. Infant mortality is higher, instances of sickness and disease are much higher\u2026 and let's say that you wanted to start turning this place around\u2026let's say you wanted to start a business to try to bring a little value to the lives of the people living in this town\u2026 it would be an incredibly difficult, volatile and corrupt process through everything you had to do. Even if you just wanted to leave the city and get out\u2026 you'd still have to do it traveling on roads that are in horrible condition and difficult to navigate.\u00a0\nWhat a massive difference just a few short steps can make. But why is it this way?\nWhy is it this way?\u00a0\nLet's just take a second to talk about how enormously important this question is. Think of what's at stake: the quality of life of billions of subsequent people yet to be born? The already diminished quality of life of the billions that are living now or have already lived? Are there many questions more powerful than this to consider when we're building a society?\nLook, Nations aren't just born wealthy or poor. So the thinking by the people that ask this question for a living is\u2026the fact that that's true must mean there is some thing out there that happened over the history of the country\u2026some thing we can identify that determined whether a nation eventually became rich or poor. Can it be broken down into a single mistake these countries made along the line? Is it a combination of things? What makes a nation look like Norway instead of looking like the Congo. What makes a nation look like Canada as opposed to looking like Bangladesh. Why are some countries so much more wealthy than other countries?\u00a0\nForget about just us starting our hypothetical island society\u2026if you even care a LITTLE bit about limiting the suffering of other human beings\u2026you have to see how important this question is that separates Nogales Arizona, from Nogales Mexico. Although it may be wishful thinking\u2026if there is some mistake that was made out there\u2026if there was some mistake that the Congo made at some point in history and we could identify exactly what that mistake was\u2026then we'd probably want to know about it wouldn't we? We're probably gonna wanna make sure anyone starting a society in the future\u2026 knows the answer to this question.\nNot to mention\u2026if we can identify the problem\u2026does that mean we can arrive at a solution\u2026to the problem? Is it too late to right the course of the ship in Nogales, Mexico? This question\u2026 is a crucial one for us to explore on this show\u2026because if one of your goals on this planet is to find a way to serve other people\u2026there aren't many other areas you can focus your time on that with a single eureka moment \u2026potentially\u2026 could change the lives of billions. \u00a0\nAnyway, it would be dishonest if I didn't start this discussion out by saying that there is far from a clear answer to this question\u2026we're not going to come away from this episode with an infallible explanation for why some countries are wealthier than others\u2026but just because there's no clear answer to the question\u2026doesn't mean every opinion out there on the matter is equally valid and it certainly doesn't mean\u2026 we haven't made significant progress when it comes to answering this question accurately.\u00a0\nNow there are a LOT of different answers thinkers have historically given to this question. But as we look at their answers\u2026 I want us to all look at the assumptions\u2026 that were made by these people. I want us to all look closely at the mistake that they made in their thinking\u2026because it's a mistake I've been guilty of in the past\u2026 and it's a mistake that we COULD ALL easily make if we don't continue to question and reassess our beliefs with vigilance\u2026and that mistake is this:\nYou arrive at a conclusion about something that is not entirely verifiable, but you believe it anyway because it SEEMS to be true. You accept this conclusion that you've arrived at as a premise for FUTURE conclusions to be built upon. You continue to stack these conclusions on top of that premise\u2026story after story until you have an entire skyscraper built on top of it\u2026but if that premise ends up not being true\u2026the entire building comes crumbling down. \u00a0\nYou'll understand what I'm talking about in a second, so over the years..people have come up with all kinds of fun answers to the question of what makes certain nations wealthier than others. Uh, Montesquieu. French political thinker\u2026he's the guy that came up with the idea that there should be a separation of powers in government\u2026obviously heavily influential on the constitution of the United States. Well as good as THAT idea was that he had\u2026they all weren't gems in the mind of Montesquieu.\u00a0\nHis idea? For why some nations are wealthier and better off than others? People from hot climates are just\u2026lazy. That's right, just look at them! With their sun and their golden brown skin\u2026let me enlighten you guys\u2026when you live in an area of intense heat\u2026the last thing you want to do is invent the iPhone\u2026no once you catch your dinner\u2026you know\u2026your daily scorpion\u2026its time to relax. The heat takes a lot out of you\u2026but conversely\u2026these people In colder climates\u2026 they just get bored if they aren't doing something\u2026they start building castles\u2026they start wearing chain mail. Keeps the blood moving.\nBut this is just one of them! Economists throughout history have given all kinds of reasons\u2026some say the reason countries are rich is because they were at one point a colony of England! Some say it all comes down to luck\u2026that some countries just initially settled in an area that had more natural resources than others. The point is\u2026there's no shortage of arguments, the vast majority of them have been dismantled and proven wrong long ago.\u00a0\nThis is obviously a very wide conversation, but if you talk to an economist in today's world here's basically where we're at: it's usually some variation of the idea that the wealth of a nation is directly related to the quality of it's labor force. Now that's an interesting distinction there. The QUALITY of a labor force. How can we find out what makes the quality of one labor force better than another?\nNow, it would be very easy to get deep down the rabbit hole of this discussion right now, but this episode isn't about modern economics\u2026its about the father of modern economics\u2026Adam Smith. And by the end of this episode we're going to come back to this discussion of the quality of a nations labor force\u2026we're going to come back to Nogales, Arizona\u2026but for reasons you'll understand at the end of this episode\u2026right now\u2026 I want to take you on a trip back in time.\u00a0\nBack before our modern standard of living, before Medicare and Medicaid, before the civil war\u2026.in many cases before the constitution of the United States was even written. I want to take you back to a time in Europe when people were a little confused about what actually made a nation wealthy.\nNow, even though it is absolutely nothing like what actually happened in the history of the world\u2026I always picture all the rulers from all the European countries coming together. You know\u2026a bunch of dudes in tights\u2026bunch of angry sociopaths laughing, syphilis eating away their brain\u2026anyway\u2026they're all sitting around having a chat about their respective countries and one of these kings that's having a particularly bad day that day pipes up and says\u2026yeah mountains\u2026mountains yeah that's cool\u2026my country's richer.\nNeedle scratches everyone stops and looks at him\u2026wait a second\u2026who does have the richest country? We gotta figure out a way to find out who has the high score! GO! GO! GO! \u2026 and what emerged was mercantilism. That's such a stupid way of putting it. Okay, so before the enlightenment in Europe some people asked the question of what makes a country wealthy. The answer they came up with was that a country was wealthy in relation to how much gold it had in its reserves. It's the equivalent\u2026 of saying that the wealthiest person is just the person that has the most money in their bank account.\u00a0\n\u2026We can kinda see where they're coming from, I guess it makes sense\u2026but in retrospect\u2026it's not that simple guys from the 1500's. You know, if you have two people in a room\u2026 one of them has $5000 in their bank account and a job that pays six figures a year\u2026and the other one has $10,000 in their bank account but has a condition that makes it so that they can never work again\u2026who is the wealthiest person in that room? Rough example, but it illustrates the point that how much money you have on hand is not all there is to it when it comes to how wealthy you are.\u00a0\nBut these people believed it! And imagine you're living in the 1500's\u2026and you believe it and now you're assigned the task of arriving at economic policy\u2026like they were. How do you think this premise affects your decision making? If you truly believed that the wealth of a nation is determined by how much gold you guys have in the reserves, and your job with this economic policy is to extend the wealth of your nation as far as possible\u2026can you think of any way this could go wrong here? Can you think of any way this might\u2026 lead to some PROBLEMS down the road?\nThis is what I was talking about before with the faulty foundation that we build a skyscraper on top of\u2026and it's the kind of thing that applies across basically ALL thinking. If the foundation of your beliefs in some area is based around a faulty premise\u2026whatever it might be\u2026you could be misattributing success to the wrong thing all along\u2026\nYou could be making decisions and planning for a future under the assumption that this premise that you have is true\u2026and when you carry out these \"policies\" that you've arrived at with the premise in mind, you could actually be sabotaging yourself. Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.\u00a0\nFor example, I'd compare it to our body and the way that we eat. Let's say that you're surfing the internet\u2026if people even surf the internet anymore\u2026and you come across one of those multicolored, blinking banners that tells you that this SINGLE MOM HAS FOUND THE ULTIMATE SHORTCUT TO HEALTHY LIVING!\nSo you click on it, and read it and it convinces you beyond a shadow of a doubt that Vitamin C is the way to go. You can't live without Vitamin C and with every piece of food that you shovel into your mouth you should think of nothing\u2026.but the vitamin C content\u2026that's how you get REALLY healthy. Don't worry about A, B, D, E, potassium, magnesium, selenium, NO! Vitamin C.\u00a0\nWell if that was the health premise that you believed and you were assigned with the task of making eating policies for your body, you know\u2026rules that you follow when you're considering putting ANYTHING into your body\u2026if you truly believed that the more vitamin C you ate, the healthier you were\u2026 why wouldn't you make a policy that every meal put in your gullet should be centered around getting the maximum amount of vitamin C.\u00a0\nWell this might be an okay policy for the first day. Or even the first couple days, but eventually your body is going to become deficient in other areas. Eventually this policy of Vitamin C at all costs is going to start making you feel sick\u2026eventually\u2026it will kill you.\u00a0\nWell apply this example to economic policy before the age of enlightenment. If you truly believed that the goal of economic policy should be to get as much gold in the reserves as possible, then you're probably going to create policies that aren't \u2014 in retrospect \u2014 GOOD for the economy, but ones that\u2026 keep as much gold in the reserves as possible\u2026and these policies\u2026like the vitamin C policy\u2026eventually made these nations feel sick and deficient in other areas.\u00a0\nThe thinking by the people at the top levels of government was, IF our nation's wealth is just contingent on how much GOLD we have in the reserves\u2026then why would we ever WILLINGLY send gold to another country at all? Why would we ever import ANYTHING that we didn't absolutely have to?\u00a0\nBuy American\u2026right? But this is the 1500's version of the buy American thing\u2026 taken to the absolute extreme. If it was even possible for you to make something or buy something domestically, the governments didn't want you importing it. Because\u2026 BY IMPORTING it and buying it from another country\u2026your sending our gold to that country\u2026making THEM wealthier. Why would we ever want that? Limit imports\u2026encourage exports.\u00a0\nWell, the people at the top of government knew this could only be done to a certain extent\u2026 there was no way a single country could produce EVERYTHING they ever needed\u2026the governments job was to make sure things didn't get off the rails too far\u2026to set regulations and restrictions and prevent citizens and businesses from importing too much stuff.\nOh and by the way, the whole time they're doing this they can frame it as something that is ultimately good for the average person too, not just the vault of gold the government has. They can say\u2026look\u2026buy domestic\u2026for the sake of job security! This whole importing business is a slippery slope! If no one buys domestic goods and everyone's just importing stuff cheaper from other places, how are we going to keep people employed domestically?\nWell, it's time to pull out your tinfoil hats everyone because there's something we need to consider moving forward here\u2026actually it's not really tin foil hat worthy, it's incredibly plausible that this could have happened. There is a large group of people in today's world \u2026that look back on Mercantilism and this age of economic policy and say that none of these people at the top of government back then REALLY believed that the policies of Mercantilism were actually going to help. None of these people actually thought that limiting imports and encouraging exports was REALLY going to contribute to the wealth of a nation in the long term\u2026what these say REALLY happened is that captains of industry in these respective countries were in cahoots with the leaders of government and that they stood to benefit from the restriction of imports because it meant less competition for them in this emerging global marketplace.\u00a0\nThe Geo-political climate in Europe during this period in history is extremely volatile\u2026more than ever before\u2026 in the history of Europe the governments of these countries were dead-set on war and territorial expansion. So much of their task during this time was fund raising\u2026 to accumulate enough gold to be able to fund these giant military expeditions\u2026I mean this is the first time in the history of many of these countries that they have navies and ground forces that aren't temporary. Typically\u2026 it's just been an assembly of people that come together when they're needed\u2026but during this period in time we're starting to see the emergence of full-time professional forces funded by the citizens\u2026.not just to fend off attacks, but to expand their borders. The beginning of this era of competing nation states is starting to change the way we see the countries that surround us.\nSo if you're the captain of the shoe industry in the 1500's. If you're the Mitt Romney of shoes back then and all of a sudden there is this emerging global marketplace that you have to be competitive in\u2026that's gotta suck. I mean for the longest time you've had the only game in town\u2026I've had people's feet in a headlock, right? MY SHOES!\u2026I don't have the machines or systems in place to compete with how these other, more efficient countries make shoes\u2026I'm just not as good as them. So\u2026 how do I make sure things stay the way they are right now? Oh, I just walk on down to the city hall\u2026head into the back room and\u2026\nHow bout this\u2026in exchange for me paying taxes and levies..and by the way you're taxing my income here so the more money I make the more money YOU make\u2026how bout in exchange for me paying into this system that funds your wars and expansion plans\u2026YOU GUYS in the government enact policies that restrict imports so that I don't have to compete with other countries?\nNow if you think this sounds like a wack-job conspiracy theory\u2026Really is it that crazy to think about this happening? I mean, think about all the other areas where progress was made during these couple hundred years we've been talking about \u2026and think about how much the old ways of thinking have always been rooted in, not what people legitimately thought was best for the whole, but in what makes a small collection of people at the top the best off.\u00a0\nThink of the reformation of the church. Think of the lives that people lived BEFORE the reformation of the church. I can't think of many people that would stand for these conditions having already lived in today's world\u2026there is no personal relationship that you have with god. No, god has decreed this code of conduct\u2026 in a language that you can't read, in fact\u2026 no one can read it or interpret it accurately but this very small collection of people at the top of this church hierarchy. I mean, many of the priests at the heads of these local congregations didn't even speak Latin! They just knew that nobody else spoke Latin and they got up there pretending to be reading from the bible and just making noises that SOUNDED like Latin\u2026and then they'd say \"Okay well there's your lesson in morality for the day. Go ahead and put your donations in this hat and I'll retire to my harem of concubines because don't forget, I am the moral authority!\"\n\u2026It's not hard to imagine how this MAY have not been set up in the best interests of everyone\u2026how maybe it heavily favored a small collection of people at the top of the industry. How about the area of government? Rousseau, Locke and Hobbes\u2026what conventional wisdom were they railing against? Oh yeah, a small collection of people at the top telling the population at large that they were genetically predestined to rule over them. That there was a divine right of kings decreed by God and that their job as citizens was to obey God and serve their king.\u00a0\nMy point is, it's not CRAZY to think\u2026 that economic policy might have been structured the same way before the age of enlightenment. This application of reason to all of these long held institutions\u2026has there ever been anything that served to benefit the population on such a wide scale more than this? The bottom line is: the economic theory of Mercantilism was a faulty premise that a skyscraper was built upon. And honestly, it doesn't matter whether it was ignorance or corruption that lead to it being adopted. You can take your pick. But the way that you view these decisions drastically changes the way you interpret some of these policies that these countries put in place.\nOne of the tenets of Mercantilism WAS to limit imports, but the policies enacted on behalf of it, extended into a lot of other areas\u2026 all centered around dishonestly propping up domestic business to give it an unfair advantage over competitors in the global marketplace. For example, they would use taxpayer money to financially back new industries in their country\u2026 then they would often times make those new industries exempt from any regulations or taxes\u2026giving them a huge advantage\u2026 and then from there they would set up monopolies and prohibit anyone from exporting anything that could possibly be useful to another country trying to compete with them. Any tools, equipment, machines and even people who were skilled at their professions. They didn't want those people to go to another country and use their skills to make some other country richer.\u00a0\nThen you have these broad, sweeping laws that were just crippling if you wanted to trade anything. In England there was something called the Navigation Act in the year 1651\u2026and\u2026it \u00a0made it so that if you were a country in Europe, and you wanted to trade with England in ANY way\u2026those things that you were importing needed to be brought to England ON an English ship\u2026or even less likely\u2026a ship registered in the country that those goods originated from.\u00a0\nIn France, Louis the 14th famously conferred a tremendous amount of power to his minister of finance Jean Baptiste Colbert. From the 1660's to the 1680's this guy DRASTICALLY increased the tax or the \"duty\" you needed to pay if you wanted to bring something into ANY French port for trade. So anyone that wanted to buy something from another country had to buy it from people that not only had to pay this giant tax, but also had to assume all the costs of transporting it. It made it very hard to be competitive. \u00a0\nWell Adam Smith takes a look at this ludicrous world that's unfolding in front of him, and by the way we'll talk about all these things in more detail and how they apply to our island in the next episode, but he comes along and he makes a lot of good observations about this flawed economic climate.\nThe first big thing that he points out is that, this idea.. of it not being good to import something because it sends gold out of the country\u2026is flat out wrong. In fact, he says\u2026it benefits us greatly to buy something from a country that produces it more efficiently than we can. If they have systems and technology in place that allows them to produce\u2026 shoes faster and cheaper than us, why would we use a giant chunk of our finite number of workers to inefficiently make shoes? Why not buy our shoes from them\u2026use THOSE workers to specialize in some other field and use the extra money we save to buy other stuff or invest in researching new fields? Free trade benefits BOTH parties\u2026 is what Adam Smith is getting at.\u00a0\nAnother revolutionary concept he arrives at that dismantles Mercantilism is the idea of economies of scale. Basically, because we'll talk about it more next episode\u2026its the idea that there are certain fixed costs associated with any sort of production that are drastically more efficient when you are producing more units.\u00a0\nThe other major criticism Adam Smith proposes is against this toxic relationship that exists between government and the chiefs of industry. He makes a case that sure, its great for those people at the top, but it hurts the population at large. Again, something we'll talk about more next time and a lot as we head into the philosophy of this new corporate world that's emerging.\u00a0\nSo why is there such a clear difference between Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Mexico? When you say that it has to do with the QUALITY of their labor force\u2026it almost sounds like you're blaming it on the people. It almost sounds like you're saying\u2026they just aren't working hard enough in Nogales, Mexico. But is the reason why people don't work hard always out of laziness? Why aren't the citizens of Nogales, Mexico going out there and working hard and innovating new things and trying to improve their lot in life?\nWell, nobody knows the answer to this question for certain, but if you take a page out of the book of Adam Smith and subsequent economists\u2026they say it comes down to the incentives that the government puts in place. Look at how humans typically act\u2026why would anybody work harder than they absolutely have to if there was no incentive to do it?\u00a0\nOne of the biggest incentives a government can provide to its citizens is a strong sense of law and order. Why innovate? Why try to serve others? Why take risks when any risk you assume to try to improve your lot in life is ultimately, probably going to be stolen from you? Better question, if this is the case, why wouldn't the government insure this basic level of protection to the people of Nogales Mexico?\nKinda reminds you of the inner cities in America\u2026why would anyone work to try to pull themselves up by their bootstraps if after they do it, someone's just going to steal their boots?\u00a0\nNow some of you are gonna say, oh Stephen West, you're being naive! These governments don't actually care about the quality of life of the average citizen, all they care about is extending and sustaining their regime of power and reaping the benefits of more money!\nBut I would argue against these regimes. If what you want is more money to sustain your power\u2026you know\u2026more GOLD in the reserves\u2026then doesn't it benefit you to improve the lives of your citizens? The formula is clear. If they feel their lives are safe, the quality of your labor force improves. If the quality of your labor force improves\u2026they make more money\u2026which you tax and then in turn, make more money for your giant vault of money that you dive into like you're scrooge McDuck.\u00a0\nOne things for certain about the differences between Nogales Arizona and Nogales Mexico\u2026it's not the peoples' fault. There's just no incentive for them to do anything else.\u00a0\nThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_45": {"date": "2015-2-6", "text": "Posted on February 6, 2015\nEpisode 50 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #050 on the Left and Right. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nThe year is 1789 and the citizens of France are deeply entrenched\u2026 in the battle for human rights that would forever change the course of history known as The French Revolution. See, because before there ever was a \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\"\u2026before France became what it would eventually become\u2026a war needed to be fought. But it wasn't a war on a battlefield with muskets and cavalry and all that kind of glorious stuff\u2026it was a war of ideas in a place called the National Assembly.\u00a0\nKind of ironic\u2026despite how revolutionary its production was\u2026The National Assembly that brought these ideas to pass really only existed for a short period of time. Between the dates of June 13, 1789 to July 9, 1789\u2026less than a month when it was all said and done\u2026a group of people gathered together\u2026and I could talk about the different estates of government in France during this time and the systematic political castration of the bourgeoisie\u2026but out of respect to your time\u2026the interesting part when it comes to our episode today is how this battlefield was laid out physically.\u00a0\nBecause just like in a battlefield with muskets and a cavalry\u2026 where the soldiers would position themselves on opposite sides of a room or a field\u2026.the people fighting in this war of ideas in the National Assembly about to what extent this French revolution is justified\u2026ALSO positioned themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield. There was a president of this National Assembly\u2026he would be in the middle of the room\u2026the people that supported the king and the way that things currently were in France sat on the right hand side of the president\u2026and the people that supported the revolution sat on the left hand side of the president.\u00a0\nThere was a clear divide between the two sides of the room\u2026you can hear it in the testimony of the people who were there that quote \"those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths and indecencies that enjoyed free reign in the opposing camp.\"\nWell, eventually the people on the right hand side of the room became known as the party of order and the people on the left hand side of the room became known as the party of movement. This story of the National Assembly\u2026 and the war of ideas that took place in 1789\u2026 this is the origin of the terms right wing and left wing in our modern political lexicon. This is where the terms came from! The French Revolution!\nNow why are we talking about this? Well, the reason why is because I got about three or four days into writing what I THOUGHT was going to be the next episode of the show and I had all this great stuff about Adam Smith and the Free Market and Specialization and how all this stuff applies to us on our island civilization that we've been building\u2026and then I realized I was making a giant assumption.\u00a0\nLike, why am I just assuming that you people want Adam Smith's Free Market system implemented on our island? Because you don't gotta go very far\u2026the comment section of any YouTube video\u2026it doesn't even matter what the video's about\u2026you will find someone railing against the failures of the Free Market system. They'll say that an unregulated Free Market system is a recipe for disaster and that even in today's world when we DO HAVE regulations in place\u2026it just opens up another can of worms\u2026that the richest and most powerful people and companies that stand to gain from not being regulated the most are the only ones with the resources to lobby congress and pay money to influence legislation in their favor.\u00a0\nThese people would say: the game is rigged\u2026and since we now know by experience that that's the case, if we're starting a new society\u2026why would we ever willingly cannonball into that pool again? Why not address the problems that arose in the Free Market system, come up with a BRAND NEW system that works better and use that one! Let's have a pow wow on our island! Let's all sit together in a circle and toss some ideas around\u2026theorize\u2026strategize\u2026hypothetical example after hypothetical example UNTIL!\u2026.we arrive at what seems like a new, PERFECT system on our island!\nNobodies arguing that Adam Smith's system is worthless\u2026definitely better than Mercantilism among other examples\u2026but it could be better. Why would we ever sit around idly when a better system could exist out there\u2026one that reaches our economic goals better than the old system does\u2026let's say that we all sat around on our island and arrived at a brand new, abstract theory that our projections show is going to be WAY BETTER than Adam Smith's system\u2026why wouldn't we use it?\u00a0\nLet me just pose the question to you guys real quick: What would you rather do? Would you rather implement Adam Smith's system that we know works, yes it has its flaws, but at least we know it works and we can make gradual adjustments and try to make it better. Or would you rather revolutionize economics entirely.. and try a brand new system, that admittedly has never been tried before\u2026but we have no reason to expect that it wouldn't work. It SEEMS way better than the other system, and we might run into problems but let's just correct course as we go!\nWhat you have here are two very different methods of approaching any task\u2026 any task you may assign yourself whether you're a government\u2026a person\u2026team\u2026anything. We're going to come back to these two methods in more detail, but first let's talk about a couple of very important people from the enlightenment that embody these two approaches.\u00a0\nThere is a common misconception thrown around a lot today about a couple of political thinkers from the age of enlightenment. I've heard dozens of people say this thing over the course of my life\u2026the idea is that when it comes to modern day political thought\u2026there's two kinds of people in the world\u2026whether you consider yourself on the left or on the right\u2026your thinking if you traced it back\u2026is ultimately derived from one of these two guys back in the age of enlightenment: Thomas Paine if you're on the left or Edmund Burke if you're on the right.\u00a0\nThey're two guys that agreed on a lot of things, but disagreed on a lot of things, their most notable disagreement was the French Revolution. Their ideas\u2026 no doubt would have put them on opposite sides of this national assembly\u2026 but can we really say that when you consider yourself left or right in today's world that really you're just making a decision between the thinking of one of these two guys?\nThis is going to sound like a classic Stephen West-ism\u2026I'm sure most of you are going to be rolling your eyes during this portion, but look\u2026this show has to stand for something or else it just becomes boring very quickly. Alright? No matter how much someone wants it to be true\u2026no matter how convenient it would be if it were true\u2026the world is not that simple (angry radio talk show hosts and cable news commentators!). The thinking of human beings\u2026 is not that simple.\u00a0\nImagine a modern day political disagreement between two coworkers that consider themselves to be left and right\u2026saying that their disagreement is ultimately just the age old disagreement between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke\u2026That's like saying that when a husband and wife are arguing in the store about which light bulbs to get, well they're really just having that age old disagreement between Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison! \u2026.I can't tell whether that example was genius\u2026or absolutely horrible.\nForget all the history between the age of enlightenment and today. Forget all the specifics that they're arguing about\u2026Forget the statistics and facts and talking points that they disagree on\u2026to say that in modern times all we have are tens of millions of Thomas Paines arguing against tens of millions of Edmund Burke's is just a shameful oversimplification.\u00a0\nBy the way\u2026you knew they were oversimplifying things from the very beginning when they starting talking about left and right as though they're terms that are easily definable by one guy's thought anyway. How do these people think we define left and right when we're talking about them in today's world? Yeah, I get that everyone has their own definition of what they are in their heads\u2026but you have to acknowledge that there is far from a consensus on what they are right? I mean it highly depends on who's talking about it and when.\u00a0\nSome people say the further left you get the more government influence you think there should be in people's lives and the further right you get the more individual freedom there should be. Some people say the further left you get the more you believe in communal property and the further right you get the more you favor private property. Some people say the further left you get the more you believe in a planned economy and the further right you get the more you favor free enterprise.\u00a0\nThe point is\u2026Left to Right is just a spectrum\u2026and depending on what particular issue you're using as the basis for that spectrum\u2026it might drastically change where your views fall on it. On some spectrums, anarchists are all the way to the right\u2026on others\u2026all the way to the left. We've all heard both sides say that if you left the other side to their own devices\u2026the world you'd be left with would be Nazi Germany!\u00a0\nAnyway, I'm not going to ramble about this all day\u2026but this does raise an interesting question for us to ask ourselves\u2026and it goes like this:\nIf this is untrue, if this is just an oversimplification\u2026why do so many people trumpet this common misconception that we're all ultimately either Thomas Paine or Edmund Burke in our political thinking? I mean, if it was COMPLETELY unfounded it never would have gotten off the ground to begin with. Right? After all, the reason why stereotypes even catch on in the first place and have people repeating them is because there's at least some small, minuscule element of truth associated with them, and I've noticed that exact same pattern when it comes to oversimplified worldviews.\u00a0\nIf you were walking around saying that Leprechauns were controlling our political thoughts\u2026everyone would look at you like you're crazy. Nobody would repeat that stuff\u2026so what is the small, minuscule element of truth associated with us all being descendant from Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke?\nWell, let's talk a little about these two guys, but first let me just say that as a podcaster\u2026 I didn't even want to talk about these two people. They just lend themselves to people that like to cherry-pick scripture\u2026you know they like to treat their books like they're the Bible and then put a ton of emphasis on certain passages that reinforce their interpretation of them but completely ignore other things that go against them. I mean, I've read a LOT of commentary on philosophy over the years and there are very few people that have the kind of revisionist history cult followings that these guys do\u2026\nbut anyway\u2026just a word of warning: I'm not claiming that this episode encompasses every possible interpretation you could have of these two gentlemen\u2026In fact I'm going to shy away from trying to define them at all. As listeners of this show, rather than me using your time up droning on about the myriad of different interpretations of their work and speculating about who these guys really were when you get down to it\u2026I'm gonna do what I think is a much more productive usage of your time, let's ask ourselves the questions that these guys were asking about government during their time. Because I think by asking them well understand ourselves better\u2026.\nEdmund Burke was an Irish Political philosopher. He was born and raised in Dublin in the year 1729 and died in 1797. He was a huge advocate of revolutionary changes in India during this time and a huge advocate of the American Revolution in 1776. But he DIDN'T agree with the French Revolution. He would have been sitting on the RIGHT side of the national assembly. It's not that Edmund Burke hated French people for some reason\u2026he thought for various reasons that the French Revolution and the American Revolution were completely different.\u00a0\nOne of the main pillars of Edmund Burke's thinking that no one is going to argue with is the importance of tradition. Rousseau, Locke and Hobbes all talked about this state of nature that we were originally in\u2026 and it was through a social contract with either each other or the sovereign that we escape from this state of nature\u2026much to our chagrin if you're Rousseau. Burke didn't see it this way\u2026he didn't think that\u2026 whatever this thing called \"society\" was should be relegated to just\u2026 whoever is alive now and whatever material things they want the government to guarantee for them\u2026No society is something deeper than that\u2026it's something that's roots extend throughout the entire history of that culture\u2026and that any contract that we have not only needs to consider and be respectful of the that are people alive today\u2026but everyone who has come before us and everyone who is yet to be born.\u00a0\nOn that same note, just to mark another contrast between Burke and these other political thinkers\u2026by this time it was a really common idea that human beings have certain natural rights. Rights that no matter what time period or society or culture we live in\u2026we have those rights simply by virtue of being a human being. Life, liberty, the fruits of our labor, natural law\u2026these sorts of themes pervade the works of Locke and Hobbes. But Burke didn't agree with this either\u2026there is no BASELINE of rights that humans deserve inherently as is suggested by natural law\u2026no you are only entitled to the rights that have been traditionally given to you \u2026in your given society.\u00a0\nAnd if this seems weird to you, consider Burke's intentions here: it was to PRESERVE the wisdom from previous generations. The thinking was, if something had been a long running institution throughout a societies history and they had been successful with it for a long time\u2026it must work. The true test of legitimacy to Burke\u2026was whether something was rooted in tradition.\u00a0\nThis was a welcome change for some during a time like the age of enlightenment\u2026 when so many new ideas were being arrived at that no one truly knew whether they were going to work or not. This is what Burke is trying to circumvent\u2026the implementation of these SWEEPING revolutionary changes based on abstract theories to a given society\u2026when that concept might not even work given the tradition of that society.\u00a0\nHe's not just worried about this new age of reason coming up with a theory that just generally doesn't work, but he's even more worried about the possibility of one these abstract theories being so incredibly foreign to the history of a society that it ends up failing miserably or not running smoothly\u2026and therefore do more damage to society than progress. To hurt more people than it helps!\nThis is why he was FOR the American Revolution and AGAINST the French Revolution. The American Colonies were colonies of England\u2026the idea that was central to why they were revolting against England was taxation without representation\u2026you know\u2026England abusing their dominion over the American Colonies. Taxation without representation being a bad thing was something that was well-founded in the tradition and history of England, so starting a revolution in the name of going against it was perfectly justifiable to Burke.\u00a0\nBut in the case of France, aside from the bloodshed and brutality that came along with it that basically EVERY reasonable person disagreed with\u2026Burke claimed that the ideas central to the French Revolution\u2026liberty, equality, fraternity weren't based in the \u00a0tradition of the people of France\u2026in fact the whole system of government the revolution supported was in many ways completely ALIEN to the people of France and even if it wasn't ALIEN\u2026he claimed that it doesn't adequately address man's nature.\u00a0\nAgain, it's not that Burke thinks the people of France deserve freedom less than the people of America. One of the most common misconceptions of Burke is that he is against all change and that society should always stay the same as how it used to be\u2026no on the contrary\u2026Burke completely endorses positive change\u2026his disagreement comes down to the nature of that change. How should change be implemented?\u00a0\nShould it be one sweeping, revolutionary, fast or fundamental change? Or should it many focused, ordered, gradual and small changes?\u00a0\nEnter Thomas Paine.\u00a0\nBorn in England in 1737 and died in 1809\u2026spent a lot of time in America writing pamphlets supporting the American revolution\u2026then when his work was done there he moved to France to support the French Revolution. Needless to say, he was a fan of revolution\u2026but maybe the more accurate way of representing his thinking is that he was a fan of reason and believed that what is right\u2026 has nothing to do with tradition necessarily\u2026and that every generation of people \u00a0if they deem it to be correct at their time\u2026should have the ability to make fundamental, revolutionary changes to their society whether it corresponds with tradition or not.\u00a0\nThomas Paine thought that when the people of France wanted these rights like liberty, equality or fraternity\u2026despite what Burke says\u2026these things are not abstract speculations\u2026they're what humans have ALWAYS wanted\u2026they've just been oppressed by government\u2026the French revolution is just an attempt to end centuries of wrongdoing perpetrated on these people.\u00a0\nPaine would say: what kind of logic are you using there\u2026using tradition to justify behavior\u2026You could just as easily look to the past and see that your culture has a tradition of slavery and use tradition to justify perpetuating it. What\u2026just because something has been around for a long time you should preserve it? That doesn't apply to every case\u2026\nThe problem to Thomas Paine with Burke's views on the nature and speed of change.. is that when you do it this way the solutions to problems that society faces\u2026 are either not enough or come way too late if they even come at all! Paine would say that: The world is constantly changing. People's opinions about what is good are also constantly changing. How could you ever say that it is okay\u2026 to sentence the people of today\u2026 to the decisions made by other people that lived in a completely different world than them?\nI don't know about you guys, but I think they both have really good points. What we're talking about here at the most basic level are two different approaches to solving problems. But which one is better? Well, it can be kind of confusing to know what the correct approach is when you are deciding what the GOVERNMENT should be doing\u2026after all\u2026you're not a government\u2026you're a person\u2026there's a genius insight for you.\u00a0\nSo lets think about these two options in the context of solving a problem in our personal lives. A long time ago on this show I talked about making scrambled eggs\u2026 how I had been making scrambled eggs for years and I had always used the same system. Well, do me a favor for a second\u2026think back to the first time you ever made scrambled eggs. When you were in that moment\u2026you were faced with a problem\u2026that problem was\u2026how the heck do you make scrambled eggs?\nI looked at how my parents did it\u2026I put the butter in the pan\u2026I cracked the egg in the pan\u2026I scrambled the egg and I was done. Over the years I developed systems\u2026I made small, gradual changes to my egg making process, much in the style of Edmund Burke. After all, if it ain't broke\u2026don't fix it! Refine\u2026temper\u2026strengthen the process, but why start some egg revolution in my household?\nThen that fateful day when I watched Gordon Ramsey cook HIS scrambled eggs on YouTube. These concepts that he was throwing out were COMPLETELY alien to me. Put the butter in AFTER you crack the egg? Continuously take the eggs on the heat and off the heat to prevent it from cooking too quickly? Season it AFTER you cook the eggs? To top it off\u2026his eggs looked WAY better than my eggs! To me\u2026 This was like some EGG philosopher coming at me with one of those abstract theories that Edmund Burke was warning about!\u00a0\nAnd look\u2026if I cared enough about improving my egg making I could have arrived at these conclusions myself\u2026maybe even better ones! If I cared enough to research the chemistry and logistics of making scrambled eggs to the point of mastery\u2026I wouldn't even NEED this sort of intervention from the philosopher Gordon Ramsicles\u2026\nAsk yourself this question: what do you do in your normal life when it comes to improving your methods for doing things? Did you arrive at a way of doing things a long time ago and day by day try to refine the process and make gradual changes\u2026or do you watch videos and revolutionize the process every now and then with a new abstract theory that you've run across? Here's a better question: Do you really need to be one or the other exclusively?\nThis is the minuscule kernel of truth that's at the heart of this point that people make that modern political thought is ultimately a bunch of Thomas Paines vs a bunch of Edmund Burkes. When we're faced with a problem as a society\u2026 what method do you typically want the government to use when solving that problem? Do you tend to side with innovation and change and revolutionizing the area that we have a problem in? Or do you tend to look to what we already know works and try to gradually make things better?\nYou can see examples of this divide all around you in politics. For example, Obamacare. Now\u2026I'm not naive alright\u2026I fully understand the arguments on either side that would say the disagreement has nothing to do with fundamental principles of how the government should solve problems\u2026but that\u2026.you know one side would say the only thing the other side doesn't like about it is the \"Obama\" part of Obamacare\u2026and THOSE people would say the only reason the other side likes it is that it attaches one person's decision making to everyone else's tax dollars\u2026I get it\u2026either way\u2026isn't it interesting how the divide still exists even in something as politicized as Obamacare.\u00a0\nWe have a problem with our healthcare system. One side says that what we already have is good\u2026it just needs some adjustments\u2026why risk a complete overhaul of the system that might completely fail in this country or end up being worse when we have something that works. Again, here's Burke's adherence to tradition\u2026gradual, slow changes.\u00a0\nThe other side says that the problems are systematic and epidemic and that no amount of knob turning is going to fix the fundamental problems that we have with it. We need revolutionary change in the healthcare sector.\u00a0\nLet me hit you with the same arguments metaphorically speaking.\u00a0\nWhen you're on the South Pole\u2026any movement in any direction is north. When you're at rock bottom\u2026any movement is forward progress. But we AREN'T at rock bottom in modern America\u2026we actually have a lot of great stuff and there is way too much at stake to implement SWEEPING changes based only on abstract theories that have never been tried here before.\nThe other side says sometimes if you want to reach your target\u2026you just need to get moving. If we're taking a road trip from San Diego to New York City\u2026It's much better to just start driving..check the GPS and correct course along the way than to sit in San Diego agonizing about what the PERFECT way to arrive there is.\u00a0\nThis was the major disagreement between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. And I know there's not much room for my two cents on this podcast, but it almost feels like we need BOTH as a society. Sometimes, we need the broad sweeping changes\u2026 at other times we need the other side to preserve and improve those broad sweeping changes. It's terrible looking at the bipartisan gridlock in modern politics\u2026and if you feel strongly on one side of the debate or another it can oftentimes feel like you want there to just be a dictatorship for like\u2026two months\u2026so that things can ACTUALLY get done. Things DO get done in a dictatorship after all. But for the sake of our island, where we'd no doubt have a strong divide between these two methods of implementing change\u2026I think these two ways of thinking may need each other.\nThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_46": {"date": "2015-2-24", "text": "Posted on February 24, 2015\nEpisode 51 \u2013 David Hume\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #051 on David Hume. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo as you're all well aware\u2026the last several episodes of the show have consisted of me rambling on about some island. Something about a shipwreck\u2026somehow we're all STRANDED on the island\u2026and for some reason we can't get off the island and we need to play make believe and imagine all the different ways our island society would look if we applied ideas present in various thinkers during the age of enlightenment. We've considered good ideas\u2026bad ideas\u2026and for six seasons of your life I've been talking about polar bears and smoke monsters and alluding to a climax where all the loose ends of the island will come together\u2026and now its the finale and I'm giving you nothing!!\nLook, all kidding aside, I realized something this week. There's no clear end to this extended island metaphor we've been using. It's not like\u2026oh you just talk about a little Adam Smith and a little Jean Jacques Rousseau\u2026and now we know everything there is to know about how to build a society from scratch. No, political and economic thought doesn't just END during the age of enlightenment. And unless if this podcast is going to be one where just ignore any philosophy that doesn't concern itself with nation building\u2026then we run into a very real predicament.\u00a0\nThere is going to have to be a time that we step away from the island\u2026temporarily!\u2026There is going to have to be a time that we talk about the breakthroughs in other areas of philosophy\u2026metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics\u2026I guess what I'm saying is:\nThis island\u2026 is going to have to be something that we keep referring back to\u2026it's gonna have to be a mainstay in Philosophize This!\nand as avid listeners you'll know about it\u2026everybody else tuning in for the first time will be completely confused\u2026but it will end up being great. We'll talk for a while about our place as members of this society on our island\u2026then we'll take a break and look at things in terms of \u2026say being an individual, or in terms of being a thinking thing at all\u2026then we can return back to the island and return to thinking of ourselves in terms of being one cog in this tremendous machine that we call society.\u00a0\nSo, David Hume. I feel it's necessary for me to say before we start that David Hume is one of my favorite philosophers of all time\u2026not because I agree with everything he has to say, but because of how his brilliance is timeless. Like, whenever a philosopher comes out with an ambitious treatise laying out all sorts of ideas\u2026once history gets done with it\u2026it almost becomes like the carcass of a dead animal. because every philosopher that comes after them comes up to it and takes a little piece of it. They're like hyenas. They write their responses to the treatise\u2026they often times make good points that the original guy can't respond to \u00a0because\u2026 he's dead. \u2026and eventually it gets picked at so much that it starts to resemble a dead animal that vultures have picked clean in the middle of the desert. David Hume's work is surprisingly different.\u00a0\nYou know we often talk favorably about movies that stand the test of time\u2026and what we're talking about when we refer to these movies is the idea that even after twenty, thirty, forty years\u2026this movie endures as something that holds people's interest. So as we continue for the next few episodes talking about the philosophy of David Hume, just remember that his ideas stand the test of time not for 20 or thirty years\u2026but for 250 years. Just keep that in mind as we go along.\nThere are very few issues that are as integral to contemporary discussions of ethics than the one we are about to talk about. And it's funny because in the context of David Hume's work\u2026it really was a small point\u2026maybe even a throwaway point\u2026\nand it's one of these things that's going on around you all the time, but you never really notice it\u2026.and then once you hear David Hume say it\u2026you start to see it everywhere around you\u2026you know \u2026you start to see when people make weak arguments all the time: What I'm referring to is David Hume's problem of is vs ought. Let me explain what I mean with an example.\u00a0\nYou ever walk into a 7-11 and you grab your Gatorade and funjuns and get to talking to the guy behind the counter? Maybe this guy is particularly social-able\u2026maybe you ask him his thoughts on something from the news of the day and you guys get talking about the state of affairs in the world. Maybe the guy behind the counter decides that he's going to tell you about his own personal philosophy that he lives by.\u00a0\nFor example, what if this guy said: Look at the world. Filled with violence and destruction. Just look at the perpetual state of war that we're in\u2026just look at the genocide that's committed on a regular basis\u2026look at the terrorist attacks! What if this guy behind the counter said that it's obvious to him that the reason people are doing all these terrible things is because they just didn't have parents or friends that loved them enough. So, because of that, his personal philosophy is to live each day spreading as much love as he can\u2026giving as much love as he can to each person that comes through his 7-11 buying their Doritos and Mountain Dew.\u00a0\nWell let's dissect this a little bit\u2026what is this guy doing at the core of his statement? Well on one hand why would you ever question his statement? I mean wow! What a great guy! He just wants to spread as much love as he possibly can until he kicks the bucket one day! But on the other hand\u2026what he is doing here\u2026is taking some observation that he has made about the way that the world is\u2026and then using only that observation as a basis\u2026he's making a blind inference about how he OUGHT to be acting because of it.\nNow many of you are probably saying\u2026well who cares? Why don't you give the guy a break! He's not hurting anybody\u2026he just wants to love people! And that's true\u2026and in this example there is probably no harm that is going to come from him making this kind of assertion\u2026but David Hume looked around him during his time period and noticed that people make these sorts of inferences ALL THE TIME! And as sweet and innocent as this one example of it is\u2026David Hume would say that when you honestly take a look at it\u2026its really based on absolutely nothing and people use it all the time to justify doing terrible things.\nFor example\u2026I look out into the field and I see that there are people that look completely different from me, they are far more physically capable than I am and can't hold a conversation about math or science\u2026.therefore they OUGHT to be my chattel slave.\u00a0\nOr another example, women are born with the ability to grow a child inside of them and are great nurtures and are emotionally intelligent\u2026therefore they OUGHT to just spend their time pumping out kids because things like business and politics probably don't interest them very much.\nDo you see how fast this can go downhill? The problem is the difference between descriptive and prescriptive statements about the world. And people weren't just drawing ethical conclusions from these observations during David Hume's time\u2026you know they weren't just using this to justify \"loving\" people or to justify the role someone \"ought\" to be playing in society\u2026people were doing it with chemistry, medicine\u2026this faulty argument had been used in practically every field of inquiry and David Hume saw this clearly. People were even doing it when it came to nature, itself.\u00a0\nThey would point to some way that the universe CURRENTLY is and make a judgement about how it OUGHT to be from that observation. Same logic applies\u2026just because the world is some way right now, does that mean we should be mad at the universe if sent an asteroid our way and destroyed the earth? No. That's ridiculous. There's a famous line from his work: Of the will and direct passions where he says:\u00a0\n\"Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. `Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me.\"\nNow let's keep in mind what David Hume is getting at here\u2026he's not saying that we shouldn't care about the destruction of the world\u2026he's attacking a dishonest inference that people sometimes make by looking at the way the world is and then pretending that the way things ought to be naturally follows from it.\u00a0\nPeople do this\u2026all the time and like I said before just keep your eyes open around you and you'll see just how often people talk about how they ought to act and found it in a statement about what the world is. And again, like in the case of the guy from 7-11, there may be good conclusions that come from this mistake in thinking\u2026but David Hume wants us to acknowledge they are in no way true beyond any criticism\u2026and we owe it to ourselves to be mindful when we make this is/ought judgement.\nBut if you're still wondering why this matters to you. If you're still wondering how this is/ought distinction is relevant to discussions that we have with each other in modern times, just consider for a second that in today's world\u2026right now at this very moment\u2026there is an entire community of people dedicated to the task of acquiring a progressively more and more accurate view of what the universe is. This community is very well-funded\u2026we're all very familiar with this community because it's substantially improved the lives of people over the course of the last couple hundred years\u2026children go to school for decades dreaming of one day being a member of this community. You may have heard of this community before\u2026it's called science.\nThrough unbiased, falsifiable experiments attempting to arrive at empirical evidence\u2026science aims to understand what is. So any further distinction you could make\u2026No! Science is about how things work! No! Science is about causes and relationships in the natural world\u2026 all of these distinctions are ultimately just science FULLY understanding what the universe is. Now, if we look at that fact through the lens of Hume's is/ought distinction\u2026then that leaves science with certain limitations that we have to accept.\u00a0\nNow you say that word, \u00a0\"limitations\" and typically as humans we see a negative connotation associated with that word. To talk about the limitations of something is to put that thing on blast\u2026as the kids say. But just think of how ridiculous that is! Everything has limitations. If something didn't have limitations you wouldn't be able to distinguish it from anything else\u2026it's the limitations of something that give it meaning at all!\u00a0\nSo what are these limitations that I'm talking about? Well there's tons of philosophy dedicated to this but how about this for a start\u2026no matter how extensive science gets\u2026even if science understood nearly everything there was to know about what the universe IS\u2026it can never tell us what we OUGHT to do with all of this highly valuable information that it's given us.\u00a0\nNow, whenever you talk about the limitations of science\u2026I've noticed that often times you're met with this bizarre hostility from people that are proponents of science\u2026and they're nice people with good intentions but where does that hostility come from really? I think that hostility is a byproduct of the time period we live in\u2026I think it's a defense mechanism because of the culture we live in.\u00a0\nYou know, I've said it on this show multiple times, but I think people are born into the world and they think that they have a choice between two things. You can believe in monotheistic religion, you know the answer to any question you could ever possibly raise is written down in this book that is the codified word of the creator of the universe\u2026.or you can believe in science. But the problem with that is that science never claimed to do everything that religion claimed to do. In fact I think that's a huge flaw in religion\u2026in that it was so ambitious in what questions it claimed to have answers to. Why is it fair to project that expectation on to science?\nLook, if science was a person\u2026if you could walk up to science and shake their hand and say, hey! I really like the work you're doing! I love all these experiments you're conducting that they're giving me a more accurate, rich and full sense of this incredible place that I live in called the universe\u2026but if I had one criticism for you\u2026I gave you 4 out of 5 stars on iTunes because\u2026although you're doing such a great job when it comes to telling me about what the universe is\u2026you never tell me what I ought to do once I have all this information!\u00a0\nIf you told this to science\u2026she would look at you and say\u2026I know! Look, man I never claimed to be the moral arbiter of the cosmos\u2026I'm good at giving you the information\u2026what you do with that information is not what I'm concerned with! In fact, to be concerned with it, might affect my ability to perform unbiased science. Science is fantastic at telling us what the universe is\u2026it's the best thing we got so far\u2026but any inference you make about how we should act in light of that information or how the universe ought to be because of that information\u2026is exactly that: a HUMAN inference, and therefore subject to flaws.\u00a0\nThis is actually an argument in favor of science. Understanding the limitations of science, helps us do better science. This is why people have taken their scrutiny of science so seriously over the years\u2026science is the baby of truth seekers. And sometimes we need to change the diaper of that baby\u2026or it starts to cry.\u00a0\nAnyway, so this begs the question: if the limitations of science precludes it from telling us about ethics\u2026what should fill in that gap? Well it seems very clear that David Hume thought it was philosophy's job to fill that void\u2026and he has in my opinion a highly underrated work on ethics that we'll probably be spending an entire episode on, but I guess the important point here is that David Hume didn't think that this responsibility fell onto the shoulders of religion. He was a huge critic of the religion of his time, primarily Christianity he has a very illuminating part of his work where he says that:\n\"Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.\"\nAnd what he means when he says this is that because of the nature of religion\u2026you know\u2026when you have 1500 pages of cryptically worded sentences that claim to be an inerrant moral doctrine for humans to follow\u2026and that comes with certain consequences. you can take two sentences here and arrive at a beautiful conclusion about how you should treat your fellow people with love and compassion\u2026but then you can take these two sentences over here and justify the Spanish Inquisition. What he's talking about is that when theologians or religions make a mistake in the realm of ethics\u2026it can be dangerous\u2026but when a philosopher arrives at a wrong conclusion\u2026well he just gets proven wrong and people laugh at him a couple centuries later.\u00a0\nThere's not much congruity with this episode and I apologize for that, but I want to spend the rest of this episode talking about one of these criticisms that Hume had of religion that was so unsettling\u2026the echoes still are ringing to this day. No theologian since has adequately addressed his criticisms and now a whole sub-branch of philosophy exists because of it.\u00a0\nSo we've all heard someone be asked whether they believe in God. If their answer is yes\u2026they're commonly asked WHY they believe in God. One common answer to this question is some variant of the statement: I look around me, I see what exists and I can't imagine this all springing into existence out of nothing. I think about before the universe existed\u2026and these people say that nothing was there. Then poof! Magically something was.\u00a0\nHow do you explain that? Something can't come from nothing! 0+0 doesn't equal one. It equals zero. Something must have brought all of this into existence.\u00a0\nWell whenever someone makes this argument, they're doing it from a place where they'e making several assumptions\u2026most notably\u2026a very easy assumption to make about causality. \u00a0We know where they're coming from\u2026we've talked about it on the show before!\u00a0\nI needed a cause to come into existence. You needed a cause to come into existence. My parents and your parents needed a cause to come into existence. Every rock, tree, squirrel, moose, every blade of grass\u2026uh\u2026Oprah! We all needed a cause and you can follow that \"causal chain\" that we talked about\u2026all the way back to the very beginning and you can say well, if everything INSIDE the universe needs a cause\u2026why should the universe itself not abide by the same rules? Shouldn't IT need a cause as well? Both Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle both had a similar line of reasoning\u2026Aristotle talking about a Prime Mover behind it all. Why is everything in the universe moving? If nothing ever moved it then matter would just be standing still! So who moved it? Oh, it must be some initial unmoved Mover!\u00a0\nJust as it must be some un-caused cause at the origin of the universe. His name is God and boy do you have a lot of explaining to do.\u00a0\nFor us to understand what David Hume is arguing against, we have to understand the way philosophers had been largely thinking about the cause of the universe for 2000 years before he lived. We find this in Aristotle.\u00a0\nSo as we know, when Aristotle talked about the \"cause\" of something, he wasn't using that word in the same way we use it in today's world\u2026whenever HE talked about the cause of something, he was talking about four different causes that explain any one thing. The material cause, what the things made of\u2026the formal cause, the form or internal makeup of the thing\u2026the efficient cause, the initiator of the thing and the final cause\u2026the goal of that thing.\u00a0\nWell when Aristotle arrived at this method and he looked around him at the things in nature, he realized something. Whenever something comes from nature, three of those causes are always pretty much the same thing. All of them but the material cause. The formal, efficient and final causes are always the same.\u00a0\nTake one of those white wispy seeds of a dandelion floating through the air in the summertime. A dandelion is from nature, so it should abide by this rule. What is the efficient cause, or initiator of the dandelion seed? Oh\u2026it was a dandelion. Okay, what is the formal cause, or the internal makeup of that seed? Well, within that seed lies the potentiality to become the form of a dandelion. Alright, what is the final cause or function of that seed? To become a dandelion.\u00a0\nPeople over the years looked around them in nature\u2026tried this with enough examples and eventually believed in the rule so much that they started using it to work backwards. You know\u2026it was believed for some time that if something came from nature and you only knew the formal cause of that thing\u2026you could assume that the efficient and the final cause were the same. To know something, using this line of reasoning is to know the formal cause. By knowing the formal cause, we can infer the efficient cause. In other words\u2026by knowing the effect of something in the natural world, we can infer the cause.\u00a0\nWell this was fine when it came to most things\u2026but as we enter the age of enlightenment\u2026we're heading into an entirely different world. This is the age of Newtonian Physics. Times are changin'! Aristotle's argument about the Unmoved mover? It's only necessary if the primary state of matter is to be stationary, but in Newton's physics\u2026it was to be in motion. Aristotle's idea of things having four causes? The only cause in this Newtonian world is comparable to the efficient cause of Aristotle\u2026much closer to the way WE use the word cause in modern times.\u00a0\nDavid Hume living in this world makes it very obvious in his work that he's looking at the universe in terms of Newton's worldview:\n\u201c[A]ll causes are of the same kind, and that in particular there is no foundation for that distinction, which we sometimes make betwixt efficient causes, and formal, and material \u2026 and final causes\u201d\u00a0\nSo this whole period is a hotbed for advancements in philosophy, the natural sciences\u2026it's only fitting that David Hume would apply a skeptical eye to this common assumption that people were making that we can look at an effect that we see in the natural world\u2026and assume certain things about the cause. This assumption ran deep\u2026even when it comes to the most seemingly obvious causes you could imagine.\nHe uses the example of billiard balls. Let's say you had pool ball one sitting on one side of a pool table\u2026 and a second ball\u2026let's call it pool ball 2 sitting on the other side of the pool table. You hit pool ball one across the table\u2026it hits\u2026the second one and pool ball two is launched forward. Well David Hume says that it seems really obvious to us that pool ball one\u2026CAUSED\u2026pool ball two to be launched forward.\u00a0\nAnd it's very human of us isn't it? I mean we're born into a world with all of this different stuff swirling around us everywhere\u2026how can we make sense of it all? The way we make sense of it and make what otherwise would be a chaotic mess of unrelated phenomena happening all around us and make it into an ordered universe that we can comprehend\u2026is by looking for causal connections between things. We see the pool ball hit the other pool ball and we assume that the first caused the other one to move. We see the squirrel jump out of the tree, attach itself to our face and ravage your eyes and forehead\u2026and we assume the squirrel caused that damage.\u00a0\nBut what Hume would say is that when you really think about the relationship between the pool balls honestly, you realize something. You realize that causality is not something you can see. You may say that the movement of pool ball one causes the movement of pool ball two, but in reality, all you know for certain is that the movement of pool ball two FOLLOWED pool ball one. Like, you can't look in between the two balls when they hit each other and SEE the causal connection between them. How could you? You don't see some spark of light in between them or something.\nAnd you could be saying, well who cares? One OBVIOUSLY followed the other, let's just assume that they caused each other. Hume would say\u2026you can't do that! For example, day always FOLLOWS night\u2026but night doesn't CAUSE day! So on one hand, we have this idea of cause that is an extremely important thing to us that we want to hang onto because it's truly one of the only ways we can make sense of the world, but then on the other hand\u2026it can't REALLY be validated beyond a shadow of a doubt by experience or reason. In other words, probably not the most solid idea\u2026 to look at an effect in the world and say that we can assume any number of things about the cause of that effect.\u00a0\nBut nevertheless, when people argue for the existence of God as a creator of the universe, this is exactly what they're doing. David Hume makes a lot of arguments against this way of thinking\u2026the first and most obvious of which is that there's no reason to assume that the universe had a beginning at all and that just because it doesn't make sense to you that something can't come from nothing, how arrogant and lazy of you to project your humanity onto the universe as a whole. Not to mention most of the people making this argument have no problem conceiving of an un-caused being that exists eternally\u2026you know it seems just as difficult to fathom the idea of a being never dying! Anyway\u2026.\nThere are more interesting arguments by David Hume when he's arguing against the Teleological argument or the Cosmological argument. The basis for the cosmological argument as you guys know is that something must have created the universe\u2026we'll call that creative mechanism God\u2026and this God must have certain qualities A. Non-physical because if it was physical you could break it into reliant parts and ask what created those parts. B. Eternal\u2026again this God NEEDS to be outside the bounds of time and space or else you could ask what happened a day before God was created\u2026C. God needs to be un-caused or necessary because to be caused raises the question of who caused God.\u00a0\nAgain, operating from the premise that the universe HAD to have been created\u2026philosophers through the middle ages were deducing what qualities this \"thing\" that created the universe must have. Non physical, eternal, necessary, un-caused\u2026and then from here they started tacking on all sorts of things like God is infinite and wise\u2026and then from there its just a short jump to applying human characteristics to God\u2026you know God is good and just\u2026and from there, it's not too far away from saying that this is the God of the Old Testament.\u00a0\nWell, what are people doing when they make these assumptions about what the \"cause\" of the universe must be and they found it in an observation about what the universe is? They are looking at an effect in the natural world (the universe) \u2026 and they are assuming things about the CAUSE of that effect (that this god must exist and that he must have these qualities). When people were thinking like this back in David Hume's time, it was grounded in Aristotle's four causes\u2026by knowing the formal cause of the universe\u2026we can assume certain things about the efficient cause of the universe.\u00a0\nSo, in other words, like causes produce like effects. But David Hume argues that even if we grant that we can make inferences about the cause of an effect by only looking at the effect\u2026even if we realize how tumultuous that whole process is\u2026we gotta be really certain we don't overstay our welcome here. After all, if like causes produce like effects, then aren't we still assuming a lot about what this God has to be? For example, Hume would say\u2026a basketball hoop is a finite creation\u2026it was created by a finite creator, after all. Like causes produce like effects, right? Well, if the God of the cosmological argument exists, then the universe is finite\u2026there has to be a place where God ends and the universe begins\u2026so shouldn't we assume that the cause of that effect is finite as well?\u00a0\nYou could do this with most qualities people assign to the creator of the universe. The point is\u2026there's a big difference between saying that some thing created the universe\u2026and saying that that thing also is infinite, wise, good, you know anything you want to tack onto it\u2026that it loves you\u2026that it knows you by your first name\u2026that it wrote a book of rules for you to follow\u2026that it wants you to get the job you just applied for\u2026if you've listened to the show, you've heard this all before. But David Hume, once again, brilliantly shows in another area of human thought, if you're not careful, just how many assumptions you can make that are completely unqualified.\u00a0\nYou know he gives an example like this: If I went to McDonald's and I sat down and ordered a hamburger\u2026I can assume certain things about the creator of that hamburger. I can assume that they're really good at making hamburgers\u2026I can assume that they're being paid to make that hamburger\u2026but I can't assume things like: this person made this hamburger with me in mind\u2026or that this person has red hair\u2026or that this person is a fan of disco music. All of those things would be unqualified assumptions that it is MY job to validate. Problem is, in the case of the McDonald's worker, I can just go back and shake the guys hand and get to know him. In the case of the creator of the universe\u2026well he's playing hard to get.\u00a0\nA good place to end today is this: in David Hume's eyes we were making a myriad of assumptions about the origins of the universe. Maybe the universe is eternal, maybe it spontaneously arose by chance\u2026maybe it didn't need a cause\u2026but either way his larger point is that we owe it to ourselves to think critically about this and not project our own humanity onto the universe. Whether you're religious or not, you believe that a LOT of people throughout history have gotten the answer to this question wrong because they hastily assumed things, right? It may seem intuitive that something can't come from nothing, because we look around us and see evidence of that in everything that exists in this macro level of existence\u2026but then again, our flawed human minds, our minds that one day when we were young just arrived at this confident opinion about how it doesn't make sense that something can't come from nothing\u2026case closed! Our imperfect human minds\u2026may not be the most qualified things to make suppositions about the causality of the universe.\nThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time. \u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_47": {"date": "2015-3-4", "text": "Posted on March 4, 2015\nEpisode 52 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #052 on David Hume. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust think for a second about what happened on the last episode of the show. We all learned about David Hume, right? Here's this guy\u2026Scottish philosopher\u2026the foreman of what's known as the Scottish Enlightenment\u2026living in the 1700's\u2026calling into question all kinds of stuff\u2026the cosmological argument for God's existence\u2026the Teleological argument for God's existence\u2026Aristotle's four causes which was *scandalous* at the time that he did it\u2026he even called into question causality itself\u2026I mean what was wrong with this guy? Was he abused as a child, does he have some sort of bum leg that makes him angry at the world like Dr. House? Why is this guy ruining the party?\nNo, David Hume wasn't any of this stuff\u2026but if there was one thing he was, it was a skeptic. There's this weird way that people look at skeptics sometimes. They think that there's some sort of relationship between skepticism and misery\u2026the more skeptical you are, the more miserable you are. But this is not the case! Skeptics can enjoy a good novel! Skeptics aren't less capable of being happy or something.\u00a0\nA long, long time ago\u2026I remember being 9 years old and watching a movie with a group of people\u2026semi circle of couches\u2026looking at a TV\u2026the movie was Star Wars. Don't remember exactly which episode it was\u2026but you get the point\u2026space laser beams, space ships flying through the air\u2026and yes space explosions.\u00a0\nNow\u2026let me just say\u2026before you people start judging me: I was a humble 9 years old in this story\u2026OK? My intentions weren't bad\u2026I was innocent! There was a genuine curiosity I had!\nSo, I'm looking at the giant space battle unfolding and I notice something: Why do all these explosions looks like they're out of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie? Shouldn't the lack of gravity be affecting these? Shouldn't the oxygen levels or something be affecting them? Why do these explosions look just like the explosions within the atmosphere of Earth? So I decide to pose the question to the group\u2026big mistake.\u00a0\nThis guy that was like 35 years old turns and looks at me and says: thanks a lot! you just ruined the entire movie for me. and I look around the room \u00a0and all the rest of the kids are like scowling at me now! you know, there's this mentality that ignorance is bliss\u2026and any skepticism about anything just makes you progressively less happy. But then I think there's a level above that where you realize how completely out of your control everything outside of your mind is and you can become even more happy than the ignorant person, but few people embody this spirit more than David Hume.\u00a0\nLike if you were to sit and have a conversation with the guy, you would see what all of his friends and colleagues unanimously talk about whenever they write something about him: the guy was cheerful, witty, brilliant, happy, jolly\u2026he was like a big skeptical Santa Claus. Even towards the end of his life when he was terribly sick and dying\u2026I mean just put yourself in that situation for a second\u2026it's easy to imagine wallowing in your own misery\u2026even then he remains with this really skeptical, wise cheerfulness. The great Scottish economist Adam Smith that we talked about\u2026a good friend of Hume during his lifetime said:\n\"Poor David Hume is dying fast, but with more real cheerfulness and good humor and with more real resignation to the necessary course of things, than any whining Christian ever died with pretended resignation to the will of God.\"\nYou hear the testimony of people that knew the guy and so many of them talk about having these sorts of deep intellectual conversations with him and he is just brilliant and funny and cordial\u2026And he LOVED having these conversations with people.\u00a0\nNow, one of the main recurring conversations that he was going to be having during his lifetime was on the subject of whether God exists and if it does\u2026 what qualities we can ascribe to that God. He would've gotten these questions mostly from religious people that understandably felt very criticized by his thinking\u2026and what we're going to talk about next is one of the most common arguments he would have fielded in one of these lively discussions\u2026\nthis would have been one of the most common arguments for God's existence during his time period\u2026recently it's lost a lot of steam just because of the concept of Natural Selection, it's lost a lot of it's bargaining power\u2026yet nonetheless, people still use this argument ALL THE TIME in today's world\u2026so how fortunate for us that we can think about David Hume's rebuttals to the argument and have it help us not only practically speaking in a conversation setting, but also help us with our own personal development.\u00a0\nThe argument is sometimes called the Teleological Argument\u2026even though there are multiple teleological arguments\u2026 sometimes called the argument from design. the argument from analogy is in here\u2026the watchmaker Argument\u2026just call it whichever one you like the best. So if someone was sitting down having a conversation with David Hume and making this argument for God's existence one of the ways they may have started out is by painting you a picture in your minds eye.\u00a0\nThey'd say, imagine you're walking down a beach. Sand beneath your toes. The ocean roaring on one side of you. Little birdies chirping in the distance. You look down in the sand and you come across a watch. You pick up this watch and your intelligence recognizes something. You look at the cogs and levers and numbers and hands and you know that these parts weren't just arranged by happenstance or randomness\u2026no you recognize a design when you see one. You may not know WHO created the watch, or WHY they created the watch or anything like that, but one thing is for certain: this is not a byproduct of RANDOMNESS. This watch was designed.\u00a0\nThe argument then takes this point and applies it to the universe: Look at how well suited everything is for the purpose it serves! Look at how I breathe oxygen and oxygen happens to be all around me! Look at how I eat plants and animals and they happen to be all around me constantly reproducing so I can persist! How convenient that I live essentially in a Terrarium that's been perfectly designed for my existence?\u00a0\nThis extends beyond human life, by the way\u2026 just look at how the universe OBVIOUSLY has order! Look at the law of gravity, look at the laws of motion, look at the laws of thermodynamics or any constant in the universe that creates this order\u2026those things OBVIOUSLY aren't just RANDOM right? So they must be intelligently designed. \u00a0\u00a0\nNow I put that last sentence the way I did purposefully, for you to recognize the real statement that the argument is making here. The only alternative to the world being a chaotic, un-ordered random mess\u2026which would be the natural state of things if it truly WERE random\u2026the only alternative is that things were designed by some higher intelligence.\u00a0\nTake a look at the human eye, for instance. If the human eye was truly just a random configuration of particles\u2026it would look like a chicken liver. It would be this bloody, mangled mess laying on a table\u2026completely useless when it comes to seeing the world. How convenient, that you look at the human eye and it is so elegantly put together, that there is a retina and a cornea and complex systems regulating eye pressure and all the things that go into making just your eye work so well to do what it does.\u00a0\nHow can any right thinking person call that randomness? You criticize ME for having beliefs based on a leap of faith\u2026you'd have to be Evil Kineval to make that leap of faith\u2026to look at the human eye and believe that it just randomly came together somehow? We have two choices and which one is more reasonable to you: that something intelligently designed all of this stuff or that this is the byproduct of unbridled randomness with no direction at all?\nWell, before we continue, just take a second to revel in the understanding of how difficult this would have been to argue against in the 1700's. I mean, I've said it on this show before, if I lived pre-Natural Selection, I NEVER would have questioned whether this place was designed\u2026it would have seemed so obvious to me. Consider for a second that David Hume DID question it.\u00a0\nReal quick I just want to clear something up because I feel like there might be a few people out there that are saying hey, what so you just blindly accept that natural selection is the way that it happened? Don't you think that's a little dogmatic Stephen West? Just assuming that it's the truth?\nWell I agree that would be presumptuous if that's what I was doing, but that's the beauty of Natural Selection when it comes to this argument. It's not that Natural Selection has to be true beyond any shadow of a doubt\u2026it's that the linchpin of the Watchmaker Argument is that you have two choices: which is more likely? a highly convenient collection of unbridled random particles\u2026or that something intelligent designed it this way?\nWhat Natural Selection offers, whether it's true or not, is an alternative explanation! An explanation for how things may seemingly be intelligently designed for this environment, but in reality some random mutations corresponded with the environment better than others\u2026this gave those creatures a severe reproductive advantage over the rest of their species\u2026and it's not that we were designed so that we perfectly correspond with the climate and living conditions on this planet\u2026it's that all the other billions upon billions of creatures over eons that DIDN'T fit nicely into these conditions died off long ago\u2026\nAgain the profundity of Natural Selection in the context of this argument is not that it is true beyond a shadow of a doubt..but simply by virtue of it existing as a theory it destroys this false dichotomy that people were operating from during the 1700's. That it's either designed\u2026or completely random. Here's a way that randomness can seem designed if its directed by the climate of a planet over billions of years. And another thing, does this really DISPROVE the existence of this designer?\nWell we'll talk all about that, but let's talk about David Hume. When David Hume heard this argument he would have had a lot to say. So let's break down the core of the argument:\u00a0\nthere are things from nature that appear to be designed\u2026like eyeballs\nand there are things that are man made that appear to be designed\u2026like watches\nthese two things share some quality: people interchange what that quality is all the time\u2026they say complexity\u2026symmetry\u2026that both things are in some way a means to some end\u2026whatever you want to put there, the argument is the same: they share certain qualities\u2026a certain \"intelligence\" between them. \u00a0\nWell, we know\u2026in the case of the watch that those qualities were put there by an intelligent designer\u2026a human. Well if we accept the premise that similar effects typically have similar causes\u2026knowing that, it seems pretty likely when we see those qualities in nature\u2026THEY TOO were put there by an intelligent designer. His name is God, buy his book at the Barnes and Noble near you.\u00a0\nNow David Hume attacks this argument at basically every\u2026single\u2026point in the argument. I mean, if you wanted him to do the thought experiment we just did of him walking along a beach\u2026there wouldn't be many sentences in that analogy that he wouldn't be able to say: now hold on! I think you're making several assumptions there now aren't you? I'm going to go over them all eventually, but let me start with the most general:\u00a0\nDavid Hume just thinks it's a terrible analogy. He says that one thing he's noticed over the years\u2026over the course of his life\u2026is that whenever you're making an analogy\u2026the further away two things are from each other\u2026the less effective of an analogy it's going to be. Like\u2026comparing Tangerines to Oranges is going to be a much better analogy than comparing a horse to a house cat\u2026just because they have four legs.\u00a0\nHume would say\u2026look we're pretending as though this majesty of Nature is comparable to a watch\u2026but is it REALLY that similar? Think of all the massive differences! Nature is primarily alive\u2026a watch\u2026or things designed by a human\u2026are never alive. Nature has a quality of self-sufficiency\u2026it regulates and maintains itself\u2026human artifacts need constant maintenance. Hume would say if you just look at the universe there are a lot of things it resembles a lot more than some intelligently designed human artifact\u2026so why stop there?\nHume would say, this is a poor analogy\u2026but let's continue. I mean I could sit here all day and argue about your analogy, but for the sake of argument let's just move forward so that I can break down the next sentence in your thought experiment.\u00a0\nThat there is some resemblance between eye balls and watches\u2026some resemblance between things in nature and things intelligently designed by human beings\u2026that is ONLY explainable by there being an intelligent designer of the universe. After all, these people are claiming to PROVE the existence of God right? The onus is on them here. Well when you put it in these blunt terms, it doesn't seem that difficult to refute\u2026I mean\u2026all David Hume needs to do is come up with an alternative explanation\u2026ANY alternative explanation that corresponds with this example and he's done his work.\nFor the record, David Hume gives several. He says maybe everything arose by chance\u2026maybe there are an infinite number of universes where every possibility is actualized and we just got really lucky. Keep in mind, a lot of people using this argument in the time of Hume would have been arguing this as a QED, mathematical PROOF of God's existence. This specific point by Hume is not supposed to be some revolutionary argument\u2026it's just supposed to cut the legs out from under someone that there is literally no other explanation for why things appear to be designed.\u00a0\nIf you find one of those people\u2026make a YouTube video\u2026you've found a rare Pokemon. In reality\u2026this is not a revolutionary argument by David Hume here\u2026alright\u2026most people making this argument are reasonable and they aren't saying that this PROVES the existence of God beyond a shadow of a doubt\u2026they're just saying which is more likely\u2026intelligent designer or that everything arose by chance.\u00a0\nSo let's do a quick recap of Hume's rebuttal so far. First, the analogy is a terrible one in the first place, there are so many fundamental differences between things in nature and things that humans create that to pretend as though things necessarily follow from this comparison is just plain irresponsible. But let's say the analogy works: Hume says an intelligent designer STILL isn't the only explanation for the resemblance you see\u2026maybe its chance\u2026maybe there's an infinite number of universes and we got lucky\u2026he definitely would've included Natural Selection in the mix here and probably several other theories after 300 years of human thought\u2026but EVEN if we ignore this and we tap out\u2026EVEN if we accept that you have now proven that there is an intelligent designer behind the origins of the universe\u2026Hume then argues\u2026what have you proven the existence of?\nLet's be real, this argument isn't used by philosophers to argue to other philosophers that there MAY have been a cause behind the origins of the universe\u2026philosophers realize this is a possibility\u2026barring some exceptions philosophers are some of the LEAST arrogant people you'll ever meet just because of the process they engage in\u2026but the reality is: the people who are typically making this argument want to prove the existence of what? The God of the Abrahamic religions.\u00a0\nJust like in the case of the Cosmological Argument\u2026David Hume is going to argue that the people who use this argument are using it to prove the existence of an intelligent designer\u2026and then they're assuming hundreds of things ABOUT this intelligent designer that there is no mention of in the thought experiment and there is no justifiable basis for believing.\u00a0\nAgain, EVEN IF WE ACCEPT\u2026the existence of an intelligent designer of the universe, what have we just proven the existence of? Think about it: all we know about this designer for certain is that it was CAPABLE of designing the universe\u2026nothing more! Hume would ask\u2026does this designer that we're talking about HAVE to be Omniscient? No, not necessarily. Okay, does it have to be Omnipotent? Does this thing have to be all powerful for it to have created the universe? Well, no. It just needed to be powerful enough to create the universe. Hume would say: yeah this God is powerful, but ALL Powerful? Yeah this God is knowledgeable\u2026but all knowing? .\nLet's not even talk about the hundreds and hundreds of assumptions we're making on top of this\u2026about whether this God made all this for us\u2026or whether this God cares about whether you're mentioning its name too close to a forbidden word or not\u2026can we even ascribe omniscience and omnipotence to it? David Hume would say no.\u00a0\nAnd he'd keep taking you down this path. He'd say, you know since I'm granting that this intelligent designer exists\u2026let's get to the bottom of exactly what we can know about this designer. How bout this one: people often would say\u2026God is perfect. Well, can we assume that this intelligent designer is perfect? After all, we're likening the design of the universe with the design of a watch lying on the beach designed by an EXTREMELY imperfect human intelligence. Can we assume that it took a PERFECT being to create this universe?\nHume would say: how about this\u2026can we even assume that it's one designer? Why should we after all? Did one human being design and create that watch? No, typically when things are designed it is an entire TEAM of designers to execute one thing\u2026why shouldn't we assume there was a TEAM of Gods designing the universe?\nAlso, Hume would argue that to claim that human intelligence needed a designer is to imply that something that is supposedly analogous to human intelligence ALSO needed a designer\u2026so who designed the intelligent designer? We're left with an infinite regress.\nHume also brings up how if we're being honest about the evidence at our disposal and not just ignoring stuff that doesn't correspond with what we already believe\u2026it's easy to find elements of nature that make it seem NOT intelligently designed. For example, that recurrent laryngeal nerve that seems INCREDIBLY counter-intuitive if you're intelligently designing something\u2026uh\u2026the appendix we don't need\u2026you know Hume would say something like the process of rain makes sense as part of an intelligent design, but why would there be devastating floods or winds if this was an intelligently designed system\u2026etc. These sorts of imperfections are things that we could point to, using the same logic as the argument by design and say that the universe is obviously NOT designed.\u00a0\nMaybe the best argument referred to by Hume is the idea that if you're walking along a beach and find a watch in the sand that stands apart from everything else and some part of you intuitively KNOWS it is intelligently designed, then if that implies a grand designer of nature, then the ocean is a watch. Every grain of sand on that beach is a watch. The snack shack made out of palm trees where you buy your disgusting paper tray of nachos is a watch. Yet, you know the watch is intelligently designed because it stands out from what\u2026everything around you that is ALSO intelligently designed?\nLet's get something straight here: none of these arguments by David Hume proves that there ISN'T an intelligent designer that cares about human behavior. For example, what if the universe was intelligently designed and God just took a very inefficient path to get to where we are now. But in fairness to Hume\u2026in keeping with his cheerful skepticism that you no doubt would have been welcomed with in one of these conversations\u2026I think his real intention is to get us to see how many unfounded logical leaps we are capable of making when we have a dog in the fight. A great lesson to take from Hume as you continue growing throughout your life.\u00a0\nSo as you can probably imagine\u2026saying the stuff David Hume did about religion and all of the assumptions they were making wasn't the best way to stay under the radar. In fact, historically it\u2019s been a great way to find out whether you\u2019re right about all this stuff you\u2019re talking about if you know what I mean. But I want to make sure we understand who David Hume was: David Hume was not a militant anti-religious person\u2026David Hume was not a Richard Dawkins\u2026flying spaghetti monster.\u00a0\n\nNo\u2026During his life, David Hume was more like one of those Apache Helicopters\u2026flying on the horizon\u2026you cant even see them but they can shoot you and when they do\u2026you lose a leg\u2026 And the reason I say that is because there was no way he was going to publish this stuff during his lifetime\u2026he knew it was a hot potato. He went up to his friend Adam Smith and said please, please do me one favor when I die\u2026make sure this work gets published! Adam Smith said forget that. Find someone else man.\u00a0\n\nSo selfishly, I kind of wish he DID come out with all this stuff just to see the backlash that would have happened to him, but on the other hand\u2026being at arms length from that kind of hostility gave him opportunities that he otherwise wouldn't have had\u2026a sort of freedom in his work. You know\u2026he recognized that not everybody that believes in this God of the Abrahamic religions founded their beliefs in philosophical proofs. The reality is\u2026if you asked most people who have a belief in God WHY they believe in God they\u2019re probably not going to stop, look you in the eye\u2026and evoke the Cosmological argument. You know\u2026people base these beliefs on a lot of different things and David Hume in many of his shorter works addresses some of these things that people cite as reasons why they believe. For historians of philosophy\u2026this is typically regarded as making a distinction between Hume's critique of Natural Religion vs Revelation. \u00a0\n\nSo, this wasn't an unpublished work..this was a highly controversial essay released in his famous Enquiry of human understanding. One of the topics David Hume dedicates an entire essay to is the concept of miracles. You know, in today\u2019s day and age\u2026you don\u2019t have to look past your Facebook feed to find news stories where\u2026you know..a baby is saved from a fire\u2026or a single person survives a train wreck\u2026and people leave comments. And if you think your Facebook feed is the only time and place in history you\u2019re going to find people calling these events miracles\u2026or the providential hand of God intervening and sparing their life for a few more years\u2026well you\u2019re wrong.\u00a0\nThe 1700\u2019s were rife with this sort of thinking\u2026and why shouldn't they have been honestly? I mean, if you believe in God why shouldn't these things reinforce your belief. Think about the fiery train wreck that the one person survived. Why did they survive when so many others perished? They should have died! How convenient! Mere coincidence? Or the creator of the universe intervening?\u00a0\n\nWell one big thing David Hume would want us to do when we look at events like these is make a distinction between miracles\u2026and extraordinary events. Because in his mind\u2026there is a HUGE difference in the implications here. Was that person surviving the train wreck unscathed a miracle? Or just a highly unlikely extraordinary event?\u00a0\n\nHE would say it was an extraordinary event. See, to David Hume\u2026 a miracle is something that only an all powerful God would be capable of. A miracle is a temporary suspension of the laws of nature. A miracle is when someone is levitating off the floor. A miracle is when someone is raised from the dead. The train wreck\u2026well that could have been coincidence right? He gives his rule of thumb when it comes to miracles here:\n\n\n\u201cWhen anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened.\u201d\n\nAnd what he\u2019s saying here is which is more likely? That the laws of nature were suspended in your favor by a supernatural God? Or that someone may have been deceived. Many of the Abrahamic religions are mutually exclusive in the claims they are making in this regard\u2026they believe in the legitimacy of their religion because of the miracles performed and the fulfillment of prophecy\u2026yet they\u2019re more than willing to turn a blind eye to the miracles that the other religions use as the basis for their beliefs.\u00a0\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s just saying lets make a distinction between miracles and extraordinary events\u2026and when it comes to miracles\u2026not that it proves they didn't happen, but which is more likely\u2026that the laws of the universe were suspended in your favor or that the miracles you believe in are the same as the countless other miracles that you\u2019re skeptical about.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to extraordinary events\u2026David Hume would have said well what do you expect? With as many moving parts and as complex as the world is\u2026we can just expect a certain number of crazy coincidences. By the way, what\u2019s the alternative\u2026that in a completely random world NOT governed by a creator that there wouldn't be any random coincidences? No one would ever survive a train wreck? In that completely random world as soon as you\u2019re on a train and it goes off the rails\u2026you\u2019re dead? Randomness is that predictable?\n\nAnother topic that David Hume discusses that is going to segue nicely into our next episode is another thing that people often use to justify their belief in some higher power: the concept of an incorporeal soul. Maybe we have no basis for believing a lot of things, but there seems to be something about humans that is different right? There's something more to these bodies than just flesh, bone and chemicals. What about the soul? Well, we'll pick up here next time when we get to the bottom of the way Hume believed humans understand the world. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_48": {"date": "2015-3-15", "text": "Posted on March 15, 2015\nEpisode 53 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #053\u00a0on David Hume. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo it would be very tempting to take what we've learned about David Hume so far and label him a big fat cheerful dude that spent his life bagging on religion. A Jesus hater. But David Hume wasn't a Jesus hater\u2026he didn't even know the guy! But if we want to understand David Hume\u2026it's important to understand what David Hume was trying to do during his lifetime\u2026 what questions was he trying to answer? I want to begin the show today with one of the most iconic and provocative quotes that ever left the mouth of David Hume. Now, this episode will look at this quote and what it means from multiple different angles, but I want to say it once now just as a bookend to the episode because I think it is very illuminating of the aims of David Hume and how ultimately he set his sights on something much, much larger than just religion in his work: \"If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.\" Now it sounds like old Humey is getting a little extreme here? Isn't He? Well, don't worry if you didn't catch exactly what he said about the two things you look for before you throw something in the fireplace and deem it to be sophistry and illusion\u2026trust me\u2026what he was trying to do with all of this will make sense at the end of this episode. So with that\u2026as promised let's talk about the soul. I\u2026am not a hamster running around a wheel at Petco. Alright? I'm more than that. Look into the eyes of the hamster\u2026is anything going on in there? No. Ah but look into my eyes and what a difference! Ask me what kind of music I like, ask me what kind of poetry I like. Ask me to tell you how I'm feeling today\u2026ask me to tell you about my favorites memories or my goals and I can relay to you all kinds of thoughts that a hamster could never even dream of. What is the hamster thinking at Petco? He's not thinking anything\u2026he's thinking wow, this is a really long wheel. The point is, there's an obvious difference between us human beings and the rest of the animals..people have all kinds of different ways of defining exactly what this difference is\u2026but whatever qualities you use\u2026there must be SOME explanation. And how about THIS explanation, there is an incorporeal soul that is responsible for it. Now this word, soul, has been hijacked all throughout history\u2026 and it's been used to mean a wide variety of different things. In fact, it's often that way by design\u2026it's a tactic used to avoid criticism. The concept itself is so mysterious and transient and it's been used to mean so many different things throughout history\u2026that to even leverage a criticism against the concept of a soul existing always leaves the believer in the soul with an out, right? Oh, you're not talking about what I mean when I say soul. Yeah those Greeks were obviously primitive in their understanding of a soul and didn't know what they're talking about, but my soul\u2026mine's different! For anyone thinking about these things in 2015 like we are\u2026for anyone that wants to be fair to other people's beliefs and really open-minded to all the possibilities out there\u2026you can start to feel a little weird and frustrated when you're having these conversations. Do you know what I'm talking about? Like, how do you get to the bottom of something that's so illusive? How do you criticize something with such a fleeting definition attached to it? This tactic isn't just something used throughout history when it comes to the soul\u2026there are a lot of pseudo intellectual scientists that do this in today's world\u2026you know they'll just say the word consciousness 185 times without ever defining terms and it just makes for a climate where it's very difficult to lob a complaint against them because it's difficult to know what you're even criticizing. I don't even think HE knows what you're criticizing\u2026and he can always side step and do the Heisman trophy stiff-arm away from weak aspects of his definition. Now this game that people like this play was something that David Hume even in the 1700's realized was going on. The reason why I say this is because even though David Hume WAS skeptical about the notion of us having a soul, in keeping with the general skepticism that surrounded EVERYTHING we think we know if you're David Hume\u2026he doesn't spend much of his time refuting the possibility of us having a soul\u2026most of his time is spent refuting individual characteristics that people attach to this soul. This\u2026 looks familiar right? Not denouncing the idea of a God existing at all, but pointing out all the unfounded assumptions we're making about that God once we've assented to the belief. Not denouncing the idea of there being an intelligent designer, but pointing out all the unfounded assumptions we're making about what that designer must be like once we believe in it. Although we should remain skeptical about ALL of this, Hume spends most of his time attacking the qualities that he thinks we lazily attach on to this soul: \"Matter, therefore, and spirit, are at bottom equally unknown, and we cannot determine what qualities inhere in the one or in the other.\" So what he's doing in this quote is addressing the typical Platonic Dualism that we've talked about before\u2026you know that we have things like thoughts that obviously aren't made of matter, so we cant ONLY be made of matter, we're made of a mixture of matter and our soul\u2026and just because our physical bodies die doesn't mean our souls die\u2026no they go on and do whatever souls do\u2026you know it was this idea from Plato that made it so easy to make Platonism compatible with Judaism, Christianity and Islam throughout the middle ages. What Hume's saying though\u2026 is that even if this soul exists\u2026what is matter? what is spirit? We can't even answer questions about what these things are, let alone be making grandiose assumptions about what attributes they must have. And one of the most common attributes people attach to their definition of the soul is that it is immortal. They say things like I can't imagine NOT existing after I die. They say that the soul is sewn from a different cloth, one not bound by the same limitations that matter and other things in the universe are beholden to that causes them to perish. The soul, that explains these qualities about my personality\u2026is immortal! Hume in very Humian fashion by the way\u2026willing to concede all kinds of unfounded points so that he cant point out FURTHER assumptions that this person is making\u2026Hume is even willing in his response to grant that we have an immortal soul: \"The soul therefore if immortal, existed before our birth; and if the former existence no ways concerned us, neither will the latter.\" What he's saying is: OK you got me. We have an immortal soul. But why should we assume that that souls' existence concerns us in the slightest bit after we're dead? I mean after all, the matter that makes up our bodies existed before we were born doing other things right? Like, the atoms that made up your body at one point belonged to a cow\u2026 until your mom ate that cow when she was pregnant and a little piece of that cow became you in her womb. Now on that same note, the atoms that make up your body continue to exist after you're dead right? When our physical bodies die they get put in the ground\u2026we get eaten by worms\u2026the worms poop us out..we fertilize the ground\u2026someone grows some beets there a thousand years later, we get consumed by the beet plant and become a little piece of this reddish vegetable that nobody likes! Now this is a very colorful, exciting narrative about what happens to our bodies after we die, but you get the point. After we die\u2026the matter that makes up our bodies continues to live on\u2026 and it doesn't concern us at all when it does that. Yet, when we assume that the soul is immortal\u2026and that we had nothing to do with it before we were born, why should we assume that we have anything to do with it after we die? What if souls are recycled\u2026when your life is over it finds another life form to attach itself to. But for most people living in Hume's time and many people living today actually they wouldn't see this as an adequate explanation. Their unique definition of the soul that they've arrived at is not something that's\u2026 separate from you\u2026it IS you. You know\u2026I have a friend that believes this\u2026when you ask him what he is\u2026he says he is a spiritual being. He doesn't HAVE a soul\u2026he IS a soul that's inhabiting this physical body\u2026he's sort of behind his eyes looking out into the world. Now what my friend is doing when he says this is something that was very prevalent in thought during the Middle Ages, like we talked about. He's conflating the idea of a soul with the idea of a self. But David Hume is even skeptical about the idea of a \"self\" existing. What is this thing that we call our self\u2026does it even exist? It's actually very eastern of him\u2026there's a whole group of people today that think that many of the ideas of David Hume may have been influenced by Buddhism\u2026there's a really interesting episode of the podcast Philosophy Bites with Nigel Warburton about this very idea. They point to the similarities between David Hume's idea of what this \"self\" thing is\u2026to the famous Buddist dialogues between King Milinda and Nagasena\u2026you know the King looks at her and says look obviously the self exists because we're talking right now and there are obviously two sides to this conversation\u2026If you don't have a self, who am I talking to really? And Nagasena says, well how did you come to court today? How did you get into this room so that you could have a conversation with me\u2026and the King goes\u2026well I rode on my chariot. And Nagasena says\u2026okay well what is that chariot? Besides just a collection of wheels and axles and a seat and pieces of wood\u2026is that chariot something more than just the collection of those ingredients? And the King says No, I guess it's not. Why should we assume that we are more than just a collection of fleeting thoughts and emotions and experiences? What David Hume is really doing here is refuting Descartes! Remember Descartes Cogito Ergo Sum\u2026I think therefore I am\u2026 The reason Descartes is even saying this is as a rebuttal to radical skepticism\u2026he thinks this is one of the only things you CAN say that no one can disagree with. But leave it to David Hume to find a way to disagree and the thing he takes issue with is the idea of us knowing that there is an \"I\" EYE think therefore EYE am. When Descartes asks his readers to look within themselves and obviously they will find that there is a self present there\u2026David Hume says no. What happens when HE looks within himself is that he just sees a bunch of thoughts and associations and ideas seemingly bundled together. Why is there necessarily some sort of continuity there, some self that possesses these things? There it is again! That same skepticism that Hume has brought to all of these different discussions we've talked about over the last couple episodes. There it is again\u2026what's known as Hume's Fork\u2026the idea that if someone makes a claim and it isn't instantly demonstrable or capable of being verified that we should \"commit it to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.\" And when you think about that maxim for a second\u2026that doesn't leave\u2026very much stuff to work with. But we want to know the truth\u2026we're human beings\u2026where does that leave us in that quest? Can we even know simple things\u2026like if anything exists at all? For many people, Hume is the end of a long stint of inquiry by the continental rationalists and British empiricists\u2026Descartes says I think therefore I am and then uses the fact that he exists as a foundation to create an entire rationalist system skyscraper on top of that foundation of things we must know if that is true. John Locke comes after him and questions that skyscraper\u2026you know we are born with a Tabula Rasa\u2026a blank slate\u2026we don't have any innate ideas and that ultimately any knowledge we claim to have is derived at least in some capacity by experience\u2026Berkeley comes along and says if knowledge is ultimately based on experience, how do we know the universe exists when we're not experiencing it?\u2026lucky for us\u2026 God is always experiencing it\u2026all David Hume does is just take this line of thinking one step further. David Hume would say: We can't be certain that anything exists, but once you realize that\u2026who really cares anyway? This is when we find out what he was getting at with all this skepticism. David Hume would say that once we get to this point where we acknowledge that we can't have certain knowledge about anything, we still find ourselves living in the world, right? I mean, sure love what you're doing Mr. Hume, I think it's lovely that you can be so skeptical about things ad infinitum, great. But we're still alive\u2026right? I still gotta drive to work on Monday. You know, I still gotta pick my kids up from the pool when they're done swimming\u2026we as a species still have to find the best way that we can to find connections and relationships between things in the natural world, the benefits of doing so are undeniable even if we can't know these things for certain. David Hume would have agreed with this wholeheartedly. He would have said look all this skepticism is not for the sake of being extreme or annoying or standoffish\u2026there are good intentions behind it. What it is\u2026is an advocacy for open-mindedness. The rigorous skepticism is just a means of making us never complacent\u2026never willing to deem our thoughts on any matter an evolutionary endpoint\u2026.no further progress is capable of being made in this field\u2026we're done. So once we've positioned ourselves atop this honest foundation that Hume lays out, how do we make sense of the world? David Hume would say: Custom is the great guide of human life. We may not be able to say with unquestionable certainty that pool ball one caused the movement of pool ball two, but the fact that we've observed it happening 100 times out of a hundred\u2026the fact that it customarily happens\u2026allows us to be pretty sure that pool ball one is causing the movement of pool ball two. NOT CERTAIN! We shouldn't attach our egos to our ideas\u2026we should always be willing and excited about being proven wrong about pool ball one causing the movement of pool ball two, but in our quest as human beings to make sense of this maelstrom of seemingly random phenomena happening all around us\u2026custom should be our guide. David Hume says: \"A wise man always proportions his belief to the evidence.\" Now hearing this maxim\u2026it's obvious David Hume was a huge proponent of science. I mean, Richard Dawkins would read that quote and just start nodding emphatically to himself. When you watch the four horsemen of the Atheist apocalypse in a debate setting\u2026they quote David Hume all the time, but the main difference between these guys and David Hume is that Hume didn't have as much of an agenda to promote science as THE means to arrive at understanding about the world. Now, I'm not saying these guys wouldn't be open-minded to a better way of arriving at understanding\u2026and I'm not saying David Hume wouldn't have agreed with them if he lived today, what I'm saying is that in the 1700's when David Hume was alive, he wouldn't have had the same need or desire to deem science to be the absolute CORRECT answer as much as these people do in a debate setting, 300 years later where no better alternative has come forward yet. David Hume saw science and religion as two things that aimed to do the same thing. That doesn't make them both equally valid\u2026he obviously would have seen science as a more reliable means, but he would have seen these two things as just two possibilities of the potentially millions of different systems we might use to arrive at understanding about the world around us. You know, Hume would say\u2026say what you want about the verifiability of religion, but it does give you a perceived understanding of your place within the natural world. If you're born into the world with a blank slate and you quickly find yourself with a strong aversion to dying\u2026and lions and lightning bolts and tons of volatile phenomena all around you that potentially threaten your existence\u2026being told that the lightning bolt was just Zeus punishing a cockroach or just a means to an end of some God that loves you\u2026that can bring you a lot of comfort in that setting. The same way that sciences perceived understanding of the world in the 1800's gave us comfort in that setting\u2026and was ultimately proven wrong. Again, Hume definitely would have seen science as a more useful means of gleaning this understanding, but he would have had a strong caveat attached to it that, look these are only two possibilities of arriving at understanding\u2026let's always be open minded to arriving at something better. This was the optimistic\u2026pioneering spirit that pervaded the thinking of this time period. For the first time in really, ever\u2026Newtonian Physics are offering a way of understanding the order in the universe that doesn't necessarily involve a God constantly maintaining it. For the first time we're starting to have ways to explain the experiences human beings have when interacting with the world that don't have anything to do with having an immortal soul. This is the world David Hume is living in: a new frontier! This really is the linchpin of his entire anthology of work: to find the most reliable means of arriving at human understanding about the world around us\u2026we've been led down a dark path in the past\u2026and to make sure that never happens again let's be ruthlessly skeptical, open-minded to new possibilities and let's proportion our belief to the evidence\u2026wherever it leads. Custom is the great guide of human life. The more predictable and repeatable that custom is\u2026the more sure we can be of how valid it is. Short term variance may allow an experiment to be done once and it might produce a strange result and we might believe something incorrect for a period of time, but eventually you do the experiment enough times and custom WILL shine through. Now silly me I'm always looking for some sort of practical takeaway from these things and pardon me if this seems like I'm taking too much liberty with Hume's ideas here, but I think in addition to the point he's making about finding the most reliable means of arriving at understanding as a species, I think it is analogous to our personal lives as well. Think about what he's saying when he says custom is the great guide of human life. The more experiences that we have, the more honest, reliable, full and rich our understanding of the universe becomes. It would be very easy for a scientist to do one experiment and then spend the rest of his life trying to validate what he already thinks he knows. It would be very easy for a scientist to restrict herself to one tiny little subsection of science and never understanding anything about the world but daffodils or something. But wouldn't some of that information about the rest of the world potentially allow the scientist to do their job better? On that same note, I have a friend whose in school to become a graphic designer. Now this guy is ambitious, alright? He has dreams of becoming one of the best illustrators of all time\u2026he has dreams of creating these elaborate, highly creative posters depicting these incredible scenes. This is what he wants to do for the rest of his life. Now in this dedicated pursuit\u2026he's decided to close himself off from the rest of the world. He doesn't want to learn about history or economics or anything new really, he doesn't want to go out and experience new things, he doesn't want to travel and see other cultures\u2026he just wants to work on his illustrations and every once in a while look at what a couple other illustrators have created recently to draw off of. Now he's not the only guy that does this by any means\u2026people do it all the time with other stuff\u2026they close themselves off to anything outside of their small town\u2026or from anything that is different than the collection of social conventions they were born into\u2026but what's wrong with this insular approach to understanding the world if you want to do anything creative? Whenever you create anything\u2026where does that come from? Does it come from somebody else's brain somehow? No, it comes from yours\u2026and when you're coming up with an idea for a creative, visionary illustration that you're working on\u2026the only ideas you could EVER possibly have are derived from the experiences you've had. Going outside of the box that you live in and broadening your horizons or experiencing new things\u2026if you're a creative person\u2026why wouldn't you want as many experiences to pull from as you possibly could? And in that same way, in the vein of David Hume, if you're trying to arrive at the most accurate and three dimensional understanding of the cause of the movement of pool ball two in this crazy world that we live in, wouldn't our understanding of it be more full and more honest and more rich, the more experiences we have with it? Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_49": {"date": "2015-3-27", "text": "Posted on March 27, 2015\nEpisode 54 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #054\u00a0on David Hume. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'd like to begin the show today by asking everyone to take out their Shakespeare bibles to the book of Macbeth, act 5 scene 5\u2026just want to read a little excerpt:\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing.\n\nNow I'd like to read another excerpt that's equally as good as that by Shel Silverstein from his magnum opus Where the Sidewalk Ends:\n\nWho wants a pancake,\nSweet and piping hot?\nGood little Grace looks up and says,\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the one on top.\u201d\nWho else wants a pancake,\nFresh off the griddle?\nTerrible Theresa smiles and says,\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the one in the middle.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat's the difference between Macbeth and Where the Sidewalk Ends really? Both Literary Masterpieces that captivated the people of the time period they were released in. I mean, how can you really say that one is better than the other?\nAsk most people this question on your Facebook wall\u2026what separates good art from bad art\u2026or what separates good art from great art and they'll most likely retreat to a little protective cocoon of radical subjectivism, right? No art is better or worse than any other art on a cosmic level\u2026it's purely personal preference. When a five year old says the cat in the hat is the greatest book ever written\u2026there's nothing wrong with saying that and his opinion is no more or less valid than a some lady whose 65 years old and has spent every waking second of her life reading and critiquing books. There is no better or worse\u2026just different.\u00a0\nConsider the flip side of this\u2026if every piece of art is good\u2026then NOTHING is good. You know, I've been learning Moonlight Sonata on the piano lately and I was really into the song and my friend was over and I wanted him to listen to it and have him see just how beautifully this song paints a picture in your minds eye\u2026so I pulled up a YouTube video and played him the song and he just\u2026sat there. Nothing. Like, it looked like he was part of an experiment like a scientist removed the section of his brain where he comprehends that music is playing\u2026he just looked up at me with the eyes of a herd of livestock\u2026like, what? Yeah, you played the music and nothing happened.\u00a0\nThis is the same guy that will look you dead in the eyes and he's serious when he says it\u2026he's not joking\u2026he will look you dead in the eyes and say that Dubstep is the greatest music that has ever been composed on this planet. Let me tell you something\u2026when a computer that is trying to log onto the internet in the 90's loves a woman\u2026sometimes things happen. I'm just kidding I actually like dubstep music\u2026but in keeping with our radical subjectivism from before\u2026I have to have reverence for his opinion.\u00a0\nYou guys all know what I'm talking about you've all had a conversation with someone over the course of your life that liked a movie or a song or a painting and you KNEW unquestionably they were morons, but you couldn't say anything because\u2026well there is no better or worse when it comes to art. Just different.\u00a0\n\nBut is this really where this conversation ends? Is there really nothing more to discuss here? Honestly most of the people that take this position that no art is better or worse just different are probably just assenting to that belief lazily\u2026they're probably just tired of thinking about it\u2026but that doesn't mean they haven't landed on something philosophically respectable by accident. David Hume would have agreed with them strongly\u2026but he would have thought they gave up too early when thinking about it\u2026they stopped short of thinking about the REAL conversation that they should be having.\u00a0\nDavid Hume would say Beauty's in the eye of the beholder. This is the layman's way of expressing the philosophical concept that there is no objective, cosmically defined, a priori beauty out there that we can somehow relate to. Contrary to people like Plato who would say there is an objective form of beauty that through rational inquiry and looking at beautiful things we can connect with it and understand\u2026Hume would stick to his subjectivist guns and say that\u2026no, there is no art that is necessarily better or worse than any other art\u2026after all custom, human experience is the great guide of human life.\u00a0\nBut just because there isn't a ideal form of beauty or good art for us to arrive at, that doesn't mean that everyone's opinion about what good art is is equally valid. See, what David Hume points out is that whenever we have these discussions with our friends about what a good song is or a bad song is\u2026we're actually talking about multiple different things and then pretending as though we're only having one conversation. We pretend as though were only merely discussing whether this song conforms with some form of beauty out there in the universe\u2026and then when we think about it and realize that there is no obvious, objective form of good art that we can point to\u2026we get frustrated and jump to the conclusion that there's nothing left to talk about\u2026everyone's opinion is equally valid.\u00a0\nBut again, David Hume would point out that someone's opinion about what good music is\u2026and whether good music is something objective are two different conversations to be having. After all, we may not be able to say definitively that the cat in the hat is worse than Macbeth\u2026but is the five year old kid that reads his first book called The Cat in the Hat and proclaims from a mountain top that it's the greatest book ever written\u2026is his opinion equally as valid as the passionate fan that's been reading and critiquing books for decades?\u00a0\nDavid Hume would say no. This is actually something very common of this time period\u2026thinkers were turning away from focusing on the cosmic or objective form of things and focusing more on the experience that individuals have when trying to connect with these things. David Hume is presenting a way not to judge the art itself, (which is a lost cause in his mind) but to judge our ability to judge, (which is possible).\u00a0\nSo at first glance\u2026this may seem like a departure from the Hume we've been discussing the last few episodes, but it's actually remarkably similar! We may not be able to objectively define what Good or Bad art is, but look\u2026we're still here right? We're still listening to Miley Cyrus\u2026we're still listening to Justin Bieber\u2026despite how willing everyone is to concede the point that everything is subjective\u2026you still have that hateful, vitriolic burning sensation within you when you look someone in the eyes and they say that they like Friday by Rebecca Black. You still have that feeling that they are sadly, sadly mistaken. Where does that come from?\nIt reminds me of skeptical ideas we've talked about in the past on the show: you know\u2026ask anyone if they think they know everything there is to know in the entire world\u2026and they will invariably say\u2026no. That's ridiculous, of course I don't know everything there is to know. Yet, so many people that would answer no to this question spend their lives desperately trying to validate what they already think they know.\u00a0\nNow, In that same way\u2026most people if you asked them about art would say that they think that art is entirely a matter of personal preference, yet we can all think of a person that fancies themselves a connoisseur of fine art or music or movies\u2026and they never even HESITATE\u2026to castigate someone else whose reasons for liking something are not as good as theirs are. Here's my point: We may say that what good art is is entirely subjective, but we're still making judgement about how good or bad art is all the time and we point to very specific things about the art to justify our claims. The perspective of the painting is incredible\u2026the composition of the piece is great\u2026the symbology the symmetry\u2026people come up with all kinds of criteria for determining what something good is. Hume would ask the question: Are some of these criteria better than others?\nHe would say\u2026yes. In fact, he has five qualities that you should cultivate if you want to consider yourself a TRUE critic of any kind of art. Hume would say, look\u2026what do we do whenever we have a disagreement about something scientific? Well, you consult an expert\u2026you go and ask a scientist. That scientist garnered a specific set of skills over years of training that make him uniquely qualified to answer your question. Why is it crazy, to think we might be able to do the same thing when it comes to judging art? To spend years of your life judging art\u2026cultivating a set of skills that renders us a master critic, or a \"tastemaker\" as Hume would put it. In tune with the standard of taste. This episode will talk about what it takes to look at art as it truly is, rather than at the mercy of your own prejudices and biases.\nBut first, before we talk about Hume's correspondence course of how to become a proper critic of art, I want to talk about a few misconceptions here. There's kind of a speed bump here for a lot of people\u2026I personally was guilty of making this mistake for many years of my life\u2026and that mistake is that some people just think they've done it. I know what good art TRULY is. Silly humans\u2026so confused about it for centuries upon centuries\u2026I've arrived at the promised land. Have you ever met that person who thinks their music is just better than everyone else's music and you're stupid if you don't realize it?\u00a0\nWell, without exception, when you press those people on the reasons why they like the music they do, they point to one of these specific faulty criteria that Hume talks about that are truly founded on nothing.\u00a0\nWe're going to talk about a few of the most common ones here. They'll be good as references later on in the episode, but I guess the cool thing here is that: Don't just think about this episode as a look at Hume's Essay Of the Standard of Taste\u2026don't just think of it like I would because I'm a masochistic person that likes to look at my own beliefs and find flaws in them and feel like I'm growing\u2026no\u2026these criteria that Hume talks out for what a proper critic is can also be used to reverse engineer the terrible arguments by angry people that need to cling on to their \"refined\" taste in something as a means of asserting themselves as superior to you.\u00a0\nTake it from me, these criteria that Hume talks out are an incredibly useful tool if you want to quickly identify what assumptions people are making about what Good art is. That's the beauty of this essay in my opinion is that what we're talking about can be used both defensively AND offensively.\u00a0\nSo one of the things people commonly point to when they're asked why their music is so much better than everybody else's is nostalgia. Their music evokes a certain emotional state much better than any other music out there\u2026and in that way it is superior. You know, you ask a million people what their favorite music is or what they think the greatest album ever written is\u2026and what a coincidence that the vast majority of them would point to the music they listened to when they were a senior in high school, or the music they listened to during a point in their life when memorable stuff was going on.\u00a0\nYou see this reasoning from people all the time\u2026and by the way it doesn't make you a bad person\u2026I am horrendously guilty of this. Judge Judy would convict me in about eight seconds. You know\u2026what otherwise would have been my senior year in high school for a long time I was homeless. I had a job but I wasn't old enough old enough to sign a lease for an apartment\u2026slept in the back of my friend's car, slept on my friend's couches, rented a room from someone as long as I could, but these sleeping situations weren't always conveniently located when it came to the work and school obligations I had on the other side of town. Miles away. So there was this giant street where I lived at the time called Meridian where I would wake up at 0 dark hundred\u20264am sometimes and I would start my two hour long walk down this street\u2026buses didn't run that early. And as I was making this walk everyday I'd listen to the same two CD's over and over again. This was before the age of iPods with 10,000 songs at your fingertips\u2026I had one of those non-skip CD players and I would just cycle in between these two CDs\u2026I'd listen to them five, six times a day sometimes.\u00a0\nAnd how convenient\u2026that for the next several years whenever someone asked me what my FAVORITE music or what I thought the greatest music ever written was, I would point to these two albums. Now, this doesn't make me a bad person if I do this, but David Hume would want me to realize that this is a very unfair prejudice that I'm bringing to the table here\u2026a prejudice that clouds my ability to be an expert at critiquing art. You could swap my body out with someone else\u2026they could have had the exact same experiences that I did while instead listening to Britney Spears, and they'd have the exact same nostalgic emotions stirred up whenever Oops I did it again! came on the radio.\u00a0\nBut how well a piece of art evokes these subjective emotional experiences in you has nothing to do with how Good or Bad the art is necessarily.\u00a0\nAnother criteria that people use to justify why their taste in art is better than everyone else's is novelty\u2026but its almost always not actually novel\u2026they just THINK it's novel. This is another prejudice Hume would want us to leave at home if we're going to be the kind of \"tastemaker\" that he talks about in his famous essay. People do this all the time.\nLike, for example\u2026my friend who thinks that Dubstep is the greatest music that's ever been written in the history of the world\u2026he also thinks that SpongeBob Squarepants is the greatest TV show that has ever been created\u2026.like he thinks in 500 years people will look back on this time period and see it as\u2026oh that was Spongebob season 12\u2026and when you ask him why\u2026there was one time he came over and I looked at him when he came in and I could tell there was amazement in his eyes.. and he goes alright Stephen last night I was watching Spongebob and there was this moment in the show that hit me like a semi-truck\u2026like a spiritual semi-truck it just floored me\u2026do you want to see it?\u00a0\nWell, of course I do\u2026so he pulled it up on YouTube and this sponge-man that lives at the bottom of the sea I gather..he says something\u2026I think it was that he referred to a city as a concrete jungle\u2026and my friend stops the video and just stares at me. Did you hear that? He referred to it as a concrete jungle. I mean come on\u2026you're just a hater if you don't recognize the poetic wordsmithing that is going on right before your eyes. You just don't want to admit that a cartoon is the pioneer of culture\u2026concrete jungle? That is a profound metaphor on the level of the greatest poets from history.\u00a0\nI couldn't bring myself to tell the guy that concrete jungle is a common phrase that people use\u2026it's practically a cliche\u2026but what an awesome example of this prejudice of false novelty that we often times bring to the table when critiquing art. I'm sure parents see this all the time when they're talking to their kids about their favorite music. You know\u2026their kids\u2026having never heard a 1-5-4 chord progression before might be listening to Miley Cyrus thinking wow this is the greatest song I've ever heard in my life\u2026this is groundbreaking\u2026what a talented gal. Their parents, aren't as impressed because it's just not new to them. They've seen decade after decade of the same formulaic, template song created because the industry knows there's a market for it.\u00a0\nI've been guilty of this many times in the past\u2026so now whenever I hear a song and say wow that's a really unique scale to use for that guitar solo or wow to switch the time signature there was a really novel idea\u2026I try to think of David Hume. I try to take David Hume's advice and reserve judgement about it being better music simply because there is some ostensible novelty that I see. Maybe I haven't seen every piece of art ever created.\u00a0\nOne more common thing that people use to justify why their art is better than yours is complexity. The thinking is that something that is more complex than something else took more skill to execute and therefore is better in some way. People that think like this will look at a band like AC/DC and think they're terrible. You know\u2026they're so simple and basic\u2026I like music like Yngwie Malmsteen or Dream Theater where there's dozens of complex layers in every song. Other people would say it's the simplicity of AC/DC that makes them so brilliant\u2026you know there's the saying perfection is not when nothing more can be added, it's when nothing more can be taken away.\u00a0\nI've done this one too\u2026I've thought that just because something takes more mechanical skill to execute that it necessarily makes it better than something more simple. But take that thinking to it's natural conclusion! You can think of tons of music more complex than hair metal bands from the 80's\u2026this person would have to recognize the utter superiority of things like Icelandic banjo picking and stuff like that. As long as a painting is more complex than another painting\u2026it's instantly better? These are the kinds of questions to ask this person.\nSo here they are: the five skills David Hume thinks are absolutely necessary if you want to consider yourself an honest, true critic of art in tune with the standard of taste:\u00a0\n\u201cStrong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character\u201d\nThis might be the most dense sentence that Hume wrote in the entire essay, so let's break it down one piece at a time.\u00a0\nSo first, Hume thinks if you're going to be a critic of any kind of art\u2026one thing you need is delicate taste\u2026or to be perceptive of delicate sentiment. The idea here is that if you're going to be on of David Hume;s ideal critics of art\u2026you should at least be able to look at something and actually SEE the entire work that you're judging\u2026including all of the finer details and choices that were made that makes the piece of art what it is. The thinking is if you look at a piece of art and someone asks you immediately after what you thought about this detail over here or how these two things work together over there\u2026and you have no idea what they're even talking about..well you probably aren't paying close enough attention.\u00a0\nThe best example of this I can think of that we can all relate to is that not everyone hears a song the exact same way, have you experienced that before. Like often times when someone has never studied or written music or even if they're just not a hardcore fan of music that listens to it all the time or tries to break it down into it's individual parts\u2026often times they listen to a song and they don't differentiate between the pieces of the song\u2026they just listen to it as one whole. So someone will ask this person\u2026what did you think of that syncopated drum part in the chorus and they will go\u2026I didn't even notice it! I had no idea that was even there\u2026I don't think of this song as all of these little details and layers coming together, I think of it as one sound that I'm listening to.\u00a0\nNow this doesn't make this person dumb\u2026and it doesn't make them incapable of ever being able to see details like that, but David Hume would say that to be one of what he considers the ideal critics of art\u2026they would need to spend time cultivating this eye for detail. Again, he's not saying that art with more details is necessarily better than art with less details\u2026he's just saying that it seems pretty reasonable that one requisite before you call yourself an ideal art critic should be that you are actually looking at everything the artist put out there\u2026not just a surface level, sensory experience of the art where you believe you see all the details.\u00a0\nYou can imagine how difficult this must be, just this first criteria by Hume. After all, when you look at a piece of art and you are trying as hard as you can to have an eye for detail, how can you be sure that you're actually seeing all the details as opposed to just BELIEVING that you're seeing all the details? What if you go the other direction? What if you read too far into something\u2026what if an artist makes a painting and then over the years as it sits in his basement and his kids are playing down there one day and put a big scratch in the side of it\u2026and now 200 years later you're reading into that line as the artists depiction of the progress of mankind? This truly is a delicate sentiment.\u00a0\nThe second thing David Hume says you need if you're going to be a true critic of art is pretty uncontroversial\u2026practice. It makes sense\u2026the more you practice something, the better you get at it. The more you practice judging art, the better you become at judging art. The funny thing here is that most people that consider themselves critics of art in today's world don't think of every new experience they have with art as an opportunity to develop their skills and become better\u2026they think of it as an opportunity to see if this thing measures up to my refined set of expectations for it. Just an interesting difference in attitude.\u00a0\nThe third thing David Hume thinks we need to properly appreciate art is\u2026to compare it to other art! This ones also pretty straight forward. There's a certain context that you garner from looking not just at your generation of art\u2026or art that your friends recommend to you in your particular social circle\u2026Hume thinks you should compare all kinds of art\u2026don't just limit yourself to one kind! If the only movie you've ever seen is Fight Club, how could you possibly know whether it is a good movie or a mediocre movie or whether any details about the movie are noteworthy at all? The thinking is, you are a better critic of art when you understand the piece of art you're judging within its proper context. David Hume thought this practice of comparison was incredibly important.\nThe next quality you got to have if you're going to be an ideal critic in the eyes of David Hume is that you must be completely free of prejudice. Or\u2026at least as free from prejudice as is possible. We've already talked about a couple of these that might be a problem\u2026whatever personally brings you nostalgia or mistaking things to be novel when they really aren't, but what about removing the prejudice you carry because you like or dislike the person that made the piece of artwork? Think of how tempting it would be to hate a TV show produced by a member of the KKK? Or a painting by Hitler? On the other side\u2026think of how tempting it would be to say that you absolutely LOVE a painting simply because you just spent two million dollars on it? Or because your step dad painted it while going through his mid-life crisis?\nHume would say this.. is\u2026 a CRUCIAL skill to have if you're going to be critiquing art\u2026you have to be able to separate yourself from these kind of things.\u00a0\nThe last one that predicates all the rest of these skills, and in many ways is the most important one of all is that you need a strong sense. To put it simply, you need to be able to see or hear or just be present to be able to experience the actual art that you're judging. I mean, a deaf guy is probably not going to be the best judge of music\u2026you're probably not going to find the next siskel and ebert by interviewing people in the hospital that are in a coma\u2026To be an ideal critic we need \u201cStrong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, that alone entitles critics to this valuable character.\nWhat is Hume getting at here? Sure, we may not be able to say that this piece of art is objectively better than that piece of art, but is everyone's ability to judge things accurately the same? Can we say that some people are better judges of art than others? David Hume would say yes. It's really interesting how so many of these things that he tells us we need if we're going to be an ideal critic are really just us removing the clouds from the world that prevent us from seeing art as it truly is, rather than just how it relates to this narrow framework we've set up so far in life so that we can make sense of things.\u00a0\nOne of the most profound points in the entire essay to me is his idea that as subjective of a matter as art seems to be on the surface, there's definitely something consistent about great art. A consistency that you don't see in other areas of inquiry where things seems more set in stone. The greatest scientist of our generation will probably not be the greatest scientist of the next generation. The philosopher we recognize as the best today will probably change as the centuries go on. But the Davincis the Homers the Shakespeares\u2026the brilliance of these people is oddly timeless. I mean, how crazy is it that we can read a poem written thousands of years ago and still recognize it as greatness. What are we connecting with there?\u00a0\nThis discussion is far from over, but next episode we're going to look at it through the lens of a very different idea of beauty is and to borrow a pun from a guy on Twitter: I Kant wait to tell you about it. Thank you for listening. Talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_50": {"date": "2015-5-11", "text": "Posted on May 11, 2015\nEpisode 57 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #054\u00a0on David Hume. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne interesting thing to consider about even the most brilliant people that have ever lived is that many of them spend years and years of their lives in a state of complete confusion\u2026 about what would eventually become their area of expertise. It's funny, you think back to someone like Immanuel Kant\u2026an Albert Einstein\u2026a Sir Isaac Newton and it's easy to project onto these people an air of invincibility. It's easy to think of Kant as some sort of philosophical prodigy\u2026you know\u2026somehow he was just born with an incredible ability to revolutionize thinking, but in reality even someone like Kant spent many years of his life in a state of limbo\u2026baffled about how to move forward with anything.\u00a0\nI want to take you back in time to the earlier years of Kant's career\u2026when he was but a young man from a poor family living in Prussia who was very much interested in philosophy. He had read a bunch of it. Was putting out work on it\u2026he spent much of his early life writing on various things in the realms of science and philosophy, but if you read what he was writing during this period in his life\u2026something was missing from it.\u00a0\nHe was kinda all over the place when it came to his fundamentals. Like, if you read his earlier stuff you'll see that it all feels very Kantian at its core. The stuff is filled with all kinds of foreshadowing to ideas that he talks about later in his more influential works, but whenever he starts talking even for a moment about epistemology\u2026depending on which work you're reading the guy switches back and forth between a couple three different ideas. He was confused\u2026But then something happened. He tells a story to explain what happened.\u00a0\nNobody knows how literally we should take the anecdote by Kant. Nobody knows whether this actually happened, or whether it was a metaphor or a parable\u2026but then again if you're Immanuel Kant and you're going to make up a story about yourself\u2026I think you'd make up something a little more cool than this. you know its like saying your dad invented Toaster Strudel\u2026why would you ever make that up? You'd make up something way cooler than that. And what Immanuel Kant says is that one day as he was in this state of confusion early on in his life\u2026he was searching for answers\u2026searching for clarity and he was re-reading David Hume and he was struck by something. Intellectually\u2026he wasn't physically struck with a rolling pin\u2026he said famously that something came over him in that moment\u2026that he was:\n\u201cI freely admit that it was the remembrance of David Hume which, many years ago, first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the field of speculative philosophy a completely different direction.\u201d\nKeep in mind as you hear this that Kant is RE-READING David Hume when he has this eureka moment. He had already read Hume, gotten whatever he could from him the first time around and was STILL confused. It was only after going back and reading him again that he had this insight that would change everything\u2026the way that HE looked at the world\u2026the direction of his future thinking\u2026and as it turns out\u2026it changed philosophy itself.\u00a0\nYou know, there's something to take from this anecdote. If you're someone that feels stuck on a particular subject you've been thinking about for years\u2026if you're someone who feels like you've exhausted every resource that's available to you when educating yourself on something\u2026and you're STILL confused about it\u2026this is a good lesson to take from Kant. Sometimes the answer may be behind you. Sometimes you may want to go back\u2026sometime you may want to re-read things that you've already read in the past because who knows\u2026for whatever reason when you first read it you weren't in the right frame of mind to receive it. maybe you weren't feeling well the day that you read it\u2026Which brings me to the point of this episode and really the point of this entire podcast\u2026I want to tell you about a man named Jesus Christ. Just Kidding.\nBut in all seriousness, what if \u00a0Kant had never gone back and re-read Hume? See, Hume's commentary on causality and all these assumptions we make about things that we see interacting in the world\u2026this was a game changer for Kant. Because it was by reading that that he realized that even the great David Hume\u2026the great skeptic himself\u2026he was like Siri if you wanted to find assumptions in arguments\u2026Kant realized that EVEN DAVID HUME had been making a massive assumption all along. What was that assumption? Well let's talk for a second about the divide we're all aware of that existed prior to Immanuel Kant between rationalism and empiricism.\u00a0\nLet's talk about it. For hundreds of years there was this scandalous and kind of complicated relationship between people when it came to how we arrive at knowledge. A schism between the rationalists and empiricists. They didn't always get along. In fact, sometimes they hated each other. Sometimes they all just started snapping and made really weird eye contact with each other and broke into one of those dance fight scenes like in West Side Story. They didn't agree on some stuff, but the point is that like the rival factions in West Side Story aside from all their territorial differences\u2026they were actually remarkably similar in a lot of ways!\u00a0\nI'm sure you guys have either had this thought or heard someone have this thought when you're talking to them about this great divide between rationalism and empiricism. Why does it need to be one or the other? Why can't we all just get along? Why can't it be a combination of the two? Rationalism AND Empiricism. And it's a good question. But the reality is, basically none of these people on either side of the argument really thought the other guys were COMPLETELY wrong. Like, if you were an empiricist you understood the value of reason when it came to drawing conclusions about the world\u2026and vice versa. The question was: which is more imperative? Which was more important as a requisite to knowledge?\u00a0\nYou know, of course there are more extreme viewpoints on either side and you guys know I'm not aiming to define every rationalist with a single sentence, but the arguments are ones that we've heard throughout the history of this podcast. You got more extreme rationalists on one side like Plato for instance who talk about total knowledge of the universe being innate. He talks about how the process that we think of as learning is REALLY just a process of remembering things that we already know by virtue of them being programmed into us.\u00a0\nRemember the story we talked about with Socrates and the slave boy that he teaches the basic ideas of geometry? The slave hadn't ever experienced geometry before. He hadn't ever seen or smelled or touched the things that Socrates was showing him, yet somehow he was able to use reason and arrive at the correct answer\u2026as if he already knew it. Socrates wasn't teaching him new ideas\u2026he was delivering new ideas like a midwife delivers a baby. To someone like Plato, it was obvious that REASON was a much more important tool when it came to arriving at knowledge, and you know the story, Plato is seen as a rationalist.\u00a0\nBut then you got people like Hume right? Custom is the great guide of human life. Reason in his work takes a subservient role. Yes, he acknowledges people use their ability to reason and it IS very important, but ultimately all knowledge at least initially comes from experience. You can't just magically conjure up new ideas with this mysterious thing called \"reason\". They would argue that the slave boy from the story isn't REALLY unearthing new ideas when Socrates is drawing squares in the dirt\u2026you know just through his life as a slave he's encountered concepts like addition and subtraction and the number four and all the other tools he'd need to reason to the correct answer\u2026and he's just using these tools that he initially gained through experience on a new project\u2026i.e. the squares Socrates is drawing in the dirt. Hume's not arguing that he isn't USING reason\u2026he's arguing that at least initially, his knowledge was borne of experience.\nNow, the common argument back from rationalists in this case would be\u2026well if everything is truly derived from some experience that I've had\u2026then how come I can imagine things that I've never seen before? I can imagine a chair made entirely out of kittens! This idea obviously isn't something I've experienced\u2026how do you explain that?\nThe common argument back to that is that you HAVE experienced it. You've experienced kittens and you've experienced chairs and you're just creating a complex idea by combining two concepts you've experienced in the past. The more serious implications of this is that:\nWhen Descartes or Spinoza or Leibniz arrive at some fundamental truth about the nature of the universe\u2026and then from there construct an ENTIRE SYSTEM on top of it using this thing they have called reason that they've used to arrive at these \"new\" ideas, that HAVE to be true\u2026it's very tempting to think that they've arrived at something true there\u2026but what the empiricists would say is that they aren't actually arriving at anything completely foreign to their experiences. This system that they've created is just a creative conglomeration of things they've experienced in the past. Which explains why many of the things they talk about are mutually exclusive.\u00a0\nAnyway, this argument can go back and forth all day. And it did. For many days. For many years. The point is, none of these people were extremists\u2026they all understood the merits of the other side of the argument\u2026they just thought that either reason or experience was MORE important than the other. And again if you're someone on the Empiricist side of things like David Hume\u2026imagine how tempting it would be to feel like empiricism is the answer to arriving at knowledge\u2026considering this scientific revolution and the very REAL improvements in the lives of the average citizen came from a method that used empirical observation\u2026a far cry from the centuries of speculation that came before.\nBut then along came Kant.\u00a0\nSee, one day in the 1700's Kant was sitting down thinking about this very topic that we're talking about right now!\u2026and he realized a giant assumption that even the great skeptic David Hume had been making. I can just imagine this conversation happening\u2026I can just imagine Kant talking to David Hume if he ever left his basement: Listen Dave\u2026help me with something real quick\u2026i think I'm confused\u2026as far as I can remember\u2026there's no seminar that we all went to right after we're born, right? There's no Tony Robbins weekend extravaganza on the nature of space and time that we all attended right after we left the womb that I missed, right? So isn't it interesting that you think that all knowledge is ultimately derived from experience, yet you talk about causality and this chaotic mess of phenomena all interacting with each other as though you're appealing to something exterior to yourself.\u00a0\nBut\u2026where did THAT come from Mr. Hume? When did you experience something that taught you about the existence of space? How could you even know to expect to have a concept of I\u2026or a concept of something being \"exterior\" to you at all? If all knowledge is derived from experience\u2026where did you learn to make that distinction? \u00a0\nIn fact, when you think about it, Kant says\u2026how is it even POSSIBLE to make that distinction? For someone to arrive at knowledge about ANYTHING in the external world\u2026they would first \u00a0need to know that it was outside of them to begin with. But how can you even identify where you end and the outside world begins without already knowing about the concept of \u00a0you and the concept of the outside world? In this way, Kant thinks there is no explanation other than the fact that the concept of \"space\" is something that we as humans are familiar with prior to experience of ANY kind. Or in cool philosophical language, apriori.\u00a0\nIt's here that we can see what we were talking about before\u2026it's here we can begin to see this nexus between rationalism and empiricism right? Kant looks at how we arrive at knowledge and he largely agrees with Hume\u2026he definitely thinks experience is an important element when it comes to arriving at knowledge, but is it everything? Kant makes the argument that it CAN'T be everything\u2026it has to be a combination of experience and certain Apriori intuitions of the mind like the concept of space.\u00a0\nNow, what does this mean? Well, aside from him finding an assumption that David Hume was making after dedicating so much of his time to finding assumptions\u2026which is kind of funny if you think about it\u2026the philosophical implications are what you guys wanna hear about.\nThink of what this means people. The concept of space\u2026this fundamental aspect of the way we perceive the world\u2026as fundamental as anything really\u2026whenever we perceive our house or our dog or a tree or anything for that matter, we attach to this tree this property of it having space\u2026we understand that tree at least partially in terms of the space that tree occupies\u2026but the property of space is NOT something that we're receiving through our senses when we look at that tree\u2026the tree isn't giving us it's property of space\u2026.\nNo, what we're getting when we look at a tree is a flurry of raw information. Billions of bits of data flying into our eyes and ears and nose and all this information\u2026 at this level makes no sense to us! Think about it\u2026have you ever seen a snow flurry? Before all the crazy living situations in California\u2026I lived in Alabama for a while and we would have these snow flurries\u2026big, thick snowflakes densely pouring down with winds coming from all directions\u2026and these snowflakes would just spiral around and twist and tornado through the air and there's no rhyme or reason to any of it. There's no way to make sense of it. It's just pure madness dancing through the air.\u00a0\nThis is what the world would be if we lived in the world of David Hume\u2026where all knowledge is derived from experience! What Kant is saying is that no, that's NOT true\u2026we have certain apriori principles of thought, things that we didn't gain from experience, that make it possible for us to make sense of anything in the exterior world. When we look at a tree\u2026we aren't seeing the world as it truly is\u2026we're seeing the map of the world that our mind creates after imposing those apriori organizing faculties onto what we are sensing.\u00a0\nI want you to think of it this way\u2026because this is how Kant explicitly talks about it. There are two worlds: our bodies and the external world. And what he means by that is that you will never experience the world as it TRULY is\u2026you'll never experience the things in themselves that exist OUT THERE somewhere outside of our experience of the world. \u00a0\nNow, don't just take this at face value\u2026this goes beyond the veil of perception problem that we were talking about in the John Locke episodes..I'll say it again..there are two worlds\u2026one of them you're never gonna see because it's OUT THERE somewhere\u2026you know things in themselves\u2026and the other one is the way that your mind depicts that world OUT THERE to make sense of it. The flurry of raw information gathered through the senses transmuted into something sensible by your mind.\u00a0\n\nKant doesn't care about what that true world is\u2026well that's actually an overstatement\u2026he spend any time with needless speculation about what that true world out there is like\u2026leave that for people like Hegel and Schopenhauer\u2026.two people that are yet to come that were heavily influenced by Kant\u2026but what he DOES do is make an important point\u2026 to a human species that had been agonizing for quite a while about finding the best way to KNOW things about the world\u2026and that point is this:\nAnything that we say we \"know\" about the world\u2026is really just us understanding some measurable facet regarding how our minds DEPICT the world\u2026.not the world itself. Not things-in-themselves. So think about the gravity of this\u2026people talk all the time about how important science or other things are as a means of arriving at more knowledge about the world\u2026but Kant I think very rightly points out that if that knowledge that we're striving for is even possible\u2026ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN\u2026that knowledge is going to be intrinsically connected to how our minds work. How our minds make sense of everything. So once you arrive at that conclusion\u2026it seems pretty obvious what to do next\u2026find out as much as you can about how the mind works. How do we think? How do we know things at all? Are there any other apriori intuitions our minds have?\nDo you understand? This is why you see the names of his major works as things like the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" or the \"Critique of Judgement\". He's writing entire treatises describing different faculties of our mind\u2026because he believed it was through understanding the mind itself that we could understand things around us.\u00a0\nBut there's more! Think of how HUGE this is! Think of the other side of Kant's idea that the concept of space is one method that our mind uses to make sense of everything around us\u2026the other big thing that this implies is that things in themselves\u2026may not have space at all. Just because I look at a tree and I see it as three dimensional and I see it as something that takes up space\u2026DOES NOT Necessarily MEAN that that thing that exists in the external world that my mind is projecting as a tree ACTUALLY takes up space. That would be an assumption. That would be me projecting the way my human mind perceives the world\u2026(the world in my body) ONTO things in themselves (the external world). He doesn't say these things DON'T have the property of space\u2026he just points out that to apply characteristics to things in themselves\u2026to something beyond anything we can ever experience\u2026is just assuming way too much.\nNow that's pretty freaky right? We aren't looking at the things in themselves, but just some depiction of the things in themselves that our mind creates that is useful to us. We don't even know if the things in themselves have the property of space. And if you haven't already guessed\u2026when it comes to these apriori things that our brains come with right off the factory floor\u2026being able to perceive space or that something outside of us exists\u2026is not the only thing that our brains come with!\u00a0\nWhat are some other things that we magically know from birth that can't be derived from experience? What other things didn't we learn from a weekend seminar before we experienced anything? Well, Time\u2026yes we talked very briefly about that one last time\u2026but how bout a more fun one. How about causality?\u00a0\nWhen we go about our lives in the world\u2026we are CONSTANTLY thinking of things in terms of cause and effect. You wake up in the morning you have a crick in your neck\u2026you look for a cause. You get a tummy ache\u2026you look for a cause.\u00a0\nSure, you may eat something bad and get a stomach ache multiple times and eventually arrive at the idea..oh my stomach hurts\u2026there must be a cause\u2026maybe I ate something bad. But, where do you get the notion of assuming causality to begin with?\u00a0\nIn other words\u2026yeah you may through tons of experiences arrive at the idea that certain things commonly cause other things\u2026but where did you get the notion that phenomena are caused by other phenomena\u2026to even think to find an association between two things? Where did you get that? This is yet another category of the mind\u2026a pre-programmed way that the mind makes sense of the otherwise insensible world. This is yet again\u2026something that our mind uses to make sense of things\u2026and it would be a mistake to project this quality onto the things in themselves. Things in the external world.\u00a0\nSo think about the implications of that! If the idea of cause and effect is just a way that our minds make sense of things in the world\u2026then much like things having the property of space\u2026things in themselves may not have the property of causality. Things in themselves may not have a cause. To assume that they DO have a cause is to project the way our minds make sense of the world onto the external world. But this is ludicrous to someone like Kant\u2026cause and effect exist as a part of human experience. This external world that we know nothing about is BY DEFINITION BEYOND human experience!\nYou can imagine how Kant must have felt about everyone's favorite cause to contemplate. Or can you? One things for sure, as we move forward into the next few episodes\u2026we're treading through some murky water. And the most baffling thing to me\u2026even now knowing what the next few episodes will be is that there can be so much more to talk about with so little that we can know at all. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_51": {"date": "2015-5-19", "text": "Posted on May 19, 2015\nEpisode 58 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #058\u00a0on Kant. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo in very Philosophize This! fashion I wanna start out the episode today by putting you through a ridiculous thought experiment. I want you to imagine you're sitting at home on a Sunday afternoon\u2026relaxing\u2026drinking some lemonade\u2026maybe a little Netflix\u2026you're laughing at something on the TV and all of a sudden someone rings the doorbell.\u00a0\nThat's odd\u2026you think to yourself\u2026I'm not expecting anyone. You like how I'm telling this like I'm an author? Like it matters what the heck you're thinking when the person knocks at the door? Anyway\u2026enough of that. You answer the door and standing before you is a really scary looking gentleman wielding an ax of some sort. Somethings off with this guy..You can't put your finger on exactly what it is\u2026maybe its the dirt caked clothes\u2026maybe its the greasy long hair with unsightly split ends\u2026but you get this vibe that the guy has taken a human life before. And if there was any doubt left inside of you\u2026he removes it by saying: hey, tell me where your kids are\u2026I want to kill them with this ax that I'm dragging around!\nWell instantly your stomach drops because you realize you're faced with quite a dilemma. Not because some strange man wants to kill your kids with an ax, but because you pride yourself on being an honest person! Don't you? This man came to your door\u2026he asked you nicely to tell him where your kids are\u2026you're faced with a tough decision! You can tell the man where your kids are and risk him disemboweling them before your very eyes\u2026or you can lie to him and be a dishonest person!\u00a0\nWhat do you do? This is a very difficult decision isn't it? Well, if you're anything like me or the hundreds of people I've asked this question to\u2026it's not difficult\u2026no in fact it's a very easy decision\u2026you tell the guy your kids are down the street, lock the door and call the cops.\u00a0\nBut what if I told you that Immanuel Kant thought that if you made that decision in that moment that you had thereby acted immorally\u2026you ought-ta be ashamed of yourself and that he had very good reasons for feeling that way? Well by the end of the episode you'll understand WHY Kant felt that way\u2026let this be a little teaser for you.\u00a0\nBut to start us off on the proper trajectory that will eventually land us there at the end of the episode\u2026just to get our minds going in that direction\u2026I want to ask you a question about morality in general right now. What do you think morality should be based on? Who or what determines what is moral or immoral? You know so many people think of morality as this codified set of behaviors that you hang on the wall of 9th grade health class\u2026like patience is a virtue! honesty is the best policy! These things are moral behaviors\u2026if you want to know how to be a more moral person you just go to the dictionary and look up this list that we've all collectively arrived at as a species.\u00a0\nWell, yes these are traits that are commonly defined to be virtuous by people, but as we've talked about on this show many times the question of morality is much more complex than that.\u00a0\nWho came up with the idea that patience was a definite virtue? Who determines what right or wrong is? Who is capable of determining what right or wrong is? Here's a better way to think of it: who would you trust to determine for YOU what right or wrong is? Now that starts to get to the root of the issue right? We're all very familiar with the concept of SUBJECTIVE morality. We're all familiar with the idea of arriving at our own personal moral code about things.\nLike, every one of us has contemplated this at some level before. We've all asked ourselves the question what does my ideal life look like? And then you picture it in your head\u2026you see how that life would look and then when you snap back to reality if there's any disconnect between the way that life looked in your head and the way your life looks right now\u2026action needs to be taken right? Usually the next step once you get to THAT place is to create a plan\u2026find some set of behaviors that will take you from where you are now\u2026to where you want to be and execute them, right? This is our own little personalized, subjective moral code that we've arrived at\u2026aimed at producing the life that we've determined to be good.\u00a0\nBut for some people this is too shaky of a moral foundation. For some people\u2026who are YOU to arrive at the proper way to behave day to day to achieve the best life possible? What did YOU do to earn that distinction? You know, you wouldn't get operated on by a surgeon who didn't to to school for it! You wouldn't fly in a plane piloted by someone that hadn't spent thousands of hours in the sky! How many hours have you really spent contemplating morality? Weighing the pros and cons of different actions\u2026really taking them to task\u2026really trying to get to the bottom of which specific behaviors yield specific outcomes in your life?\u00a0\nMany of these people say no, you're NOT an expert. This \"subjective morality\" you have is probably just a disparate collection of social conventions you've gathered throughout your life from your parents and teachers or other authority figures. Many of these people say to put this enormous burden of arriving at a system of morality on a single human being with such a limited collection of experiences to draw from while creating it\u2026is a recipe for disaster! These people say that we may need to be willing to accept that we aren't the most qualified people to arrive at a system of morality for ourselves, if for no other reason aside from the ones we've already talked about, than because far too often we are slaves to whatever fleeting emotional state we're in, in any given moment.\u00a0\nWhen you're the judge, jury and executioner for what \"right\" action is in your life\u2026often times we're far too willing to make exceptions for ourselves out of convenience in the moment, right?\u00a0\n\"Typically stealing would be wrong, but in THIS case it's okay because the guy's really rich and technically I'm only stealing ones and zeros\u2026I'm not stealing a physical CD!\" \u00a0\n\"Typically eating until I feel sick to my stomach\u2026folding over a large pizza like a giant taco\u2026typically that would be a lack of temperance I shouldn't stand for\u2026but my friends are in town. It's a celebration!\"\nNo, these people say this is far too slippery of a moral foundation\u2026there needs to be something more solid\u2026there needs to be something more objective.\u00a0\nSo how do we get there? Well what do we typically do when we have a job to do that we aren't willing to do or capable of doing? Well, you do what every great company ever since WW2 has done. You outsource to the Chinese! Just kidding\u2026the Chinese didn't do it\u2026although let's be real they probably would have done it in a heartbeat for pennies on the dollar\u2026but people DID outsource this task of arriving at a moral code and they usually did so by assigning that burden to some overseer.\u00a0\nSometimes it was a deity. Creator of the universe arrives at a way it wants humans to behave\u2026so it finds one lucky human and channels this wisdom into them\u2026they chisel it into some stone tablets and now we have a moral foundation that isn't laid out by one person\u2026it's laid out by the creator of the universe! As God, I hereby decree that you follow this set of behaviors and if you don't, bad things will happen to you!\nSometimes it was a monarch. You know, as king I hereby decree that you follow this set of behaviors, and if you don't you will be drawn and quartered. As a citizen of this kingdom it is your duty to follow these rules.\nWell, on one hand Immanuel Kant agreed: there needs to be a more solid foundation for our ethics, but he thought there was a serious problem with these ways of outsourcing the task to someone or something else. The problem is: that in the case of the deity or the monarch\u2026you can never say that you're fully to blame for your behavior.\nRemember when we talked about slavery in our episodes about Rousseau? Rousseau thought that if a master ordered his slave to kill someone else, that it would be wrong for us to hold the slave morally culpable\u2026because they are not making this decision based entirely on their own volition\u2026no the master owns them and is directing them on how to behave\u2026the slave becomes like a hung jury when rendering a verdict about what action to take.\u00a0\nWell in the same way, Kant thinks that when some monarch decrees a system of behavior for you to follow\u2026you are never TOTALLY behind an action that you choose to take\u2026that AT LEAST in some small way that monarch is inhibiting your ability to make a different decision. He is affecting your behavior in some way and ultimately isn't morality connected to us having a choice in the matter?\nI mean think about it: you don't think a lion is bad when it kills a gazelle on the Serengeti. No, that lion is just responding to impulses in it's body. The lion doesn't sit there and reason about it's decisions\u2026 perhaps I shouldn't kill the gazelle\u2026perhaps it has a family\u2026no it sees something moving and bites it until it stops moving. It's very simple! We start to hold people and things accountable for their actions when we believe they had a different choice that they could have made. You know this is the reason most people advocate a reduced sentence in our justice system for people who commit crimes who are mentally ill\u2026they weren't in their right mind\u2026they weren't making a fully autonomous choice between alternatives when they did this terrible thing.\u00a0\nNow it's because of this fact that Kant believes that the ONLY way something can be said to be truly a free decision is if it is based on our own reason. This ability to reason is the foundation for everything that will come after in Kantian ethics. This capacity to reason is Kant's way of arriving not at what he sees as some flimsy subjective morality\u2026but moral principles. And these principles would prove to be very important to him. In the same way we can use rational thought to eventually arrive at a conception about an objective reality\u2026like we talked about last episode. Kant believes it's possible to use rational thought to eventually arrive at a conception of moral principles.\u00a0\nThink about how awesome this is! In the event you're the kind of person whose like Immanuel Kant\u2026In the event you want something more than just subjective morality\u2026you know maybe you're not satisfied with just believing in whatever you arbitrarily landed on in your culture and your time period\u2026if you don't like that AND you also don't like the idea of just conceding to the will of some Monarch that tells you what good and bad is\u2026once you're in that place\u2026you have a very difficult question to answer: how should we judge human action?\u00a0\nWhere do we get a more solid foundation for what right or wrong is? Can we get a more solid foundation? Is it even possible? Is it worth thinking about? Like just think about that for a second\u2026if there was a satisfying answer to this question\u2026just think of how LIFE CHANGING that would be. Think of how much more we'd get from every experience! Think about how much more we'd understand about ourselves if we more intimately understood how we judge human action in our own minds! To me\u2026its this exciting feeling of what's possible\u2026it's that that sets the stage for every time I ever even think about ethics. Anyway I'll get off my nerd soapbox.\n\u00a0Now that said, I want us to all take a moment, lay out your prayer rugs, face the nearest library and thank your lucky stars that we \u00a0always have the luxury of looking at Kant in a historical perspective. You know\u2026there's two good ways to bring clarity to a given subject\u2026point out the differences between it and something or point out the similarities. Well, a good way for us to understand Kant's ethics better is to look at where he falls into two sides of an age old ethical disagreement\u2026that's right! I'm talking about the disagreement between deontologists and consequentialists. Now those are two words we've never said on the podcast before, so rather than obliviously continuing and telling myself that everyone in the whole world knows exactly what they mean so that I can fall asleep at night\u2026let's discuss what they mean.\u00a0\nDeontology and Consequentialism are two very broad general, competing categories for how we should look at whether human action is right or wrong. Simply put, deontologists believe that whether an action is right or wrong should be determined by looking at certain things about the action itself and weighing them up against pre-established moral principles\u2026\nConsequentialists believe that no, whether somethings ethical doesn't lie in the action itself\u2026its the CONSEQUENCES of the action that determine whether it is right or wrong.\u00a0\nBefore we continue\u2026please understand what I'm trying to do here. I'm not trying to outline every deontologist or consequentialist who has ever lived. If you fancy yourself one of these two titles\u2026understand that I understand that there are many variants and qualifications and corrections by later thinkers that deal with the weaknesses I'm going to cite for each one of these. And we'll talk about them in due time\u2026keep in mind there are MANY episodes of this podcast to come! But right now I'm just introducing the concepts\u2026and one thing we all need to know right off the bat, and something you'll agree with the more and more we learn about the two sides of this debate\u2026deontology and consequentialism\u2026is that people very rarely strongly identify with one side or the other. Most people fall somewhere in between these two camps\u2026neither of them are perfect. There are strengths and weaknesses on either side.\nNow that said, let's start with deontology. If you just type define: deontology into Google it says \"the study of the nature of duty and obligation\". And the reason it says that is because at the core of the system of any deontologist worth their salt is that the \"right\" thing to do in any situation\u2026 has at it's core an adherence to duty. Duty to what you may ask? To moral principles that have been arrived at in some way. Now we can talk all day about what method we use to arrive at those moral principles, or what they are or how we prioritize them, but the ultimate point is that when trying to decide whether something is right or wrong or good or bad\u2026a deontologist is going to look at the actions themselves rather than the consequences of those actions. Because of this\u2026the intention that someone had behind an action usually plays a key role in how a deontologist perceives the action.\nFor example, if your mom asks you to clean your room\u2026there's a big difference between a kid who cleaned their room out of a sense of duty to what the \"right\" thing their mom asked them to do is\u2026.and a kid who did it just because their mom said she'd buy them an ice cream cone if they did it. See, in both cases the consequence is that the room got cleaned, but are both people equally moral? I think most of us would say no! If someone does something just to get a \"thank you\" or just to get a special prize for having done that thing\u2026it doesn't matter how moral their actions APPEAR to be\u2026it cheapens it a bit. It seems clear that the intentions behind actions matter!\u00a0\n\u00a0Now because the whole thing revolves around a sense of duty to moral principles\u2026from here\u2026historically\u2026 it's never been a far jump away from moral absolutism. The idea that no matter WHAT the consequences of an action are\u2026no matter how seemingly bad they may be\u2026regardless of context\u2026certain actions are just right or wrong. Simple as that. Moral absolutism.\nIt wouldn't be uncommon for a moral absolutist to say things like murder is just wrong, stealing is unquestionably wrong\u2026lying is always wrong. Doesn't matter how good of a reason YOU think you have, these things can NEVER be justified. But if you still want some clarifying as to what it takes to be a good moral absolutist\u2026take it from my good friend Cardinal John Henry Newman\u202619th century moral absolutist\u2026whenever I stay up really late at night with a flashlight under the covers thinking about moral absolutism and how terrifying it is\u2026this exact passage always flashes through my mind.\u00a0\nHe said:\n\"it were better for sun and moon to drop from heaven, for the earth to fail, and for all the many millions who are upon it to die of starvation in extremest agony, so far as temporal affliction goes, than that one soul, I will not say, should be lost, but should commit one single venial sin, should tell one wilful untruth, though it harmed no one, or steal one poor farthing without excuse\"\nSo what this guy is saying is that in his humble opinion\u2026or he's speaking for the church in this passage\u2026Lying is wrong\u2026plain and simple\u2026it would be better for the sun and moon to drop from heaven\u2026for millions of people to die in agony than for one person to tell a single lie that harmed no one. Now if this sounds a little emo from Cardinal Newman\u2026you gotta admire the guys conviction, right? Who would've thought Exodus 20:16 could get so painful for all of God's children?\u00a0\n\nAnd if this sounds a little inflexible to you for a way to approach morality\u2026well you're absolutely right. It is VERY inflexible. And this is a good lesson to take from our discussion here\u2026there are strengths and weaknesses to both deontology and consequentialism\u2026this moral absolutism that we're talking about being only one type of deontology\u2026but the same criticism is leveraged against most deontology and it is this: whenever your approach to morality involves arriving at these hard and fast moral principles that you have a duty to adhere to regardless of what the consequences might be\u2026you always run the risk of being called a little inflexible.\u00a0\nTake the ax murderer example from the beginning of the episode. A deontologist who is a moral absolutist that believes lying is wrong would have to answer their door\u2026look the ax murderer dead in the eyes and tell him exactly where their kids are. If this guy was offered a billion dollars to any charity to tell one lie\u2026he would have to say no. If this guy could save a billion innocent human lives if he just lied about his weight while getting his drivers license\u2026he would have to respectfully decline.\u00a0\n\nNow I wanna make this clear: deontology is not synonymous with moral absolutism\u2026there are many deontologists we will talk about that have answers to these criticisms, but the point here today is: Deontology has many strengths. For one thing\u2026whenever you're faced with an ethical dilemma\u2026when you're in that awkward place\u2026it does provide COMPLETE certainty about what the correct decision is in a given instance. Also, it takes into consideration people's intentions behind WHY they do an action, that seems to be part of it. Its also good because it removes human discretion from the equation so there's no chance of us letting ourselves off the moral hook in the moment\u2026these are ALL strengths\u2026But these strengths come in coalition with weaknesses\u2026a key weakness being that it is tremendously inflexible and if we're being honest\u2026probably a little oversimplified because of it.\u00a0\nNow, a consequentialist on the other hand would look at the ax murderer example completely differently! A common phrase that people use to describe the fundamental idea behind consequentialism is something we've all heard before\u2026\"the ends justify the means\". What makes something right or wrong is not necessarily the act itself\u2026but the consequences that act produces. For example\u2026in the ax murderer thought experiment\u2026it wouldn't be uncommon for a consequentialist to say that it is perfectly OK to lie to the ax murderers face! Yeah, the consequentialist may not advocate lying in some situations\u2026they may not advocate lying in 99.9% of all situations\u2026but in THIS PARTICULAR situation\u2026lying to the ax murderer about where your kids are preserves human life. Lying may TYPICALLY be wrong\u2026but the ends justify the means.\u00a0\nMost philosophy 101 professors use the example of Anne Frank. Imagine you're living in the apartment during WW2 where Anne Frank and her family were hiding in the attic\u2026some Nazi soldiers came to your door and they ask you \"Is there is a family hiding in the attic of the house\"\u2026to a consequentialist\u2026knowing that if they tell the soldiers the truth\u2026people almost certainly WILL die as a result of it\u2026to a consequentialist\u2026even if they typically WOULDN'T advocate lying\u2026it is morally justifiable to LIE to the soldiers\u2026because the consequences of doing so are good.\u00a0\nSo let's think about this. On one hand this approach is very flexible, right? I mean hypothetically\u2026you could even justify murder with a consequentialist approach.\nWhat if we could somehow go back in time before WW2 and murder Hitler before he comes to power. A consequentialist might say that killing Hitler to save the subsequent tens of millions of people who died as a result of his decisions\u2026that murder\u2026in this very specific case\u2026would be morally justifiable. Interesting. And very flexible.\nBut, although this approach IS incredibly flexible\u2026it certainly comes with it's weaknesses as well right? Not the least of which is illustrated perfectly by our previous example. If we could go back in time and kill Hitler\u2026wait\u2026we CAN'T go back in time.\u00a0\nWe don't know the future. The problem with basing the moral worth of our actions only on the consequences that the actions produce is that\u2026you can't always know what the consequences of your actions will be! Even if you make your best guess and you predict the outcome pretty well in the short term\u2026you can just imagine the ripple effect you may have caused and who are we, as feeble humans, to try to understand the long term repercussions of our actions decades later? It just seems very difficult.\u00a0\nFor example\u2026what if we shift the Anne Frank thought experiment just a little bit? What if when the Nazi soldiers come to your door\u2026 asking if a family lives in the attic\u2026what if they told you that if they don't find this family while they're making their rounds today\u2026they are going to be executed. Now, no matter what decision you make\u2026human life will be lost! If you're a consequentialist\u2026how do you make your decision? What criteria do you use to determine what the best outcome will be?\u00a0\nYou may say\u2026well I'm just going to err on the side of the least human suffering! The highest good for the greatest number! You may look at the situation and see that there are four guards at your front door\u2026and five people living in the attic of the apartment. Seems like an easy decision\u2026the guards die\u2026there's four of them and five people in the attack\u2026simple as that! But how about this? What if one of those guards if they weren't executed would eventually go on to find the cure for cancer.\u00a0\nObviously you could have never known that in the moment\u2026but if you're being judged solely on the consequences of your actions\u2026you know this very extreme, rudimentary version of consequentialism that we're talking about\u2026if you're being judged on that you have just committed a terrible moral atrocity. So in deontology there are these principles we have a duty to adhere to that can sometimes run us into problems\u2026and while consequentialism is good in that it allows for a lot of flexibility there\u2026it also comes with some problems itself. The fact that the ends justify the means\u2026even if it goes against basic human rights. The fact that it is based on consequences, but when you think about it\u2026it is very difficult if not impossible to predict what the true consequences of our actions will be\u2026the fact that it DOESN'T consider the intentions behind why people do things.\u00a0\nThe end of the show kind of snuck up on me this time. You know\u2026when I started recording this I planned on getting a lot further in a half an hour, But I don't regret it and here's why: This conversation that we just had about morality in general and the differences between these two different approaches\u2026deontology and consequentialism\u2026you will remember this conversation. When we talk about these subjects in the future\u2026you will remember what these concepts mean as opposed to them just being two more words that end in \"ism\" that are meaningless. And that is what this show is about\u2026it's about wanting to know more today than you did yesterday. Not just feeling like you know more\u2026actually knowing more.\u00a0\nSo what did we learn? There are very real strengths and weaknesses to both of these systems\u2026people much smarter than me in both camps came afterwards and tried to correct some of the weaknesses..next we will talk more about them\u2026you'll find out whether you consider yourself a deontologist, a consequentialist, somewhere in between. And who knows? Maybe there's more than just these two to choose from! Thank you for listening\u2026I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_52": {"date": "2015-5-27", "text": "Posted on May 27, 2015\nEpisode 59 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #059\u00a0on Kant. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo if you've been listening to the show for a decent amount of time you've probably noticed something by this point about philosophers in general: these people just love their thought experiments don't they? Thought experiments are an important part of philosophy\u2026see as you know philosophy often times tries to get us to think about ourselves and the world in a slightly different way than we typically would\u2026the goal being that hopefully we can hack past the absolute jungle of social conventions and prejudices and all these things that've been meticulously programmed into us since birth\u2026to hopefully get a more honest depiction of reality\u2026not just one with our culture's stamp of approval. And whenever someone asks us to consider ourselves in the middle of one of these thought experiments\u2026it's so easy to be dismissive of the entire process, isn't it? It's so easy to not take a thought experiment seriously\u2026because well, it's not real! This is something I've encountered a surprising number of times when I try to talk to people about ethical dilemmas in particular\u2026like the ax murderer example from last episode or the kind of things we're going to to thinking about today\u2026you know\u2026they'll say things like \"what's the point of considering these things?\" \"what's the point of being whisked away in your little fantasy world?\" I got both my feet on the ground here. Look, I don't need to understand the fundamental reasons behind WHY I make the moral judgments I do\u2026I live my life\u2026I take all the information available to me in the moment and I just use common sense. But in the words of the great Abraham Lincoln\u2026common sense is just a collection of prejudices you've arrived at before the age of 18. Fact is: people make decisions for specific reasons\u2026not because they're appealing to this elusive thing called \"common sense\" that is just simply the right answer in any situation. No, when you cite \"common sense\" or \"sound moral reasoning\" as the justification for why you made a decision you did\u2026you STILL may be making a decision based on deontology or consequentialism or anything for that matter\u2026you're just using this term \"common sense\" as a catch-all euphemism. You know that's the other side of this. Last episode I went on a bit of a nerd tangent where I talked about the perks of arriving at a satisfying definition for all of this\u2026I talked about the potential fruits of laboring away in these ethical dilemmas and how you might over time arrive at some clarity about why you personally deem certain things to be right or wrong\u2026but be warned\u2026the exact opposite might be true as well. If you're anything like me\u2026I mean I started out thinking that I had a pretty ironclad understanding of what makes something right or wrong\u2026But what ended up happening is the more I read and the more I started thinking about all the contingencies\u2026all the different individual circumstances\u2026instead of gaining clarity\u2026I started questioning myself more! I started finding exceptions to my so-called ironclad rules. I started to get confused. I started to realize\u2026that this thing we call morality\u2026this process we call ethics\u2026not as cut and dry as I once thought. Sometimes things are not as simple as just\u2026this decision was right and this decision was wrong. It's sometimes not as simple as\u2026this person was a saint for doing what they did\u2026and this person was a monster for doing what they did. In fact\u2026 and it was a very unexpected byproduct of this whole process when it happened\u2026after thinking about these things long enough\u2026for some reason I stopped thinking of people as monsters and saints altogether. And it was weird\u2026it felt like the same sort of mental graduation that a four year old would make when they stopped believing in monsters under their bed\u2026I felt like I stopped believing in monsters. Maybe this is why I take issue with the people that talk about morality as though it's this definitive collection of adjectives that you can hang on the wall. Those people have not been through the baptism by fire\u2026it's just so obvious when you talk to them\u2026these people have not run their beliefs through the rigors of these ethical dilemmas\u2026these people are not confused enough. And I guess to tie this together if there's one thing philosophy has taught me over the years it's that confusion on a given subject is not always a step backwards. Point is: even if you're one of these people that are super confident about why you make the moral judgments you do\u2026often times you learn a lot about yourself when putting yourself through these ethical dilemmas\u2026often times you quickly realize that just by asking a few very simple questions that whatever this thing is that you use to make moral judgments\u2026whatever this thing is that you're super confident in\u2026it can be very difficult to define. Now that said, if you consider yourself a fan of philosophy\u2026there are certain infamous thought experiments you've just heard before. If you're at some sort of hoity-toity philosophy party and you walk up to the guy with the monocle and you bring them up in a conversation, that guy's going to know what you're talking about\u2026and let's continue to learn more about ourselves and where we stand ethically by putting ourselves through one of the most famous of ALL the famous thought experiments of philosophy\u2026.it's known as the trolley car problem. I want you to imagine you're the conductor of a trolley car. Now hold on\u2026before you go getting all excited about your new prestigious career as a trolley car conductor\u2026I want you to imagine you're the conductor of a broken trolley car. That's right\u2026back down a couple pegs\u2026Anyway..you're conducting this thing down the tracks one day and the brakes stop working. It's a runaway trolley car! Now to make matters worse you look ahead of you a few hundred feet and you see five people standing on the tracks completely unaware that this runaway trolley car is hurling towards them at 60 mph. It seems like there's nothing you can do! You can't STOP the trolley car\u2026it seems like it's going to run into the five people\u2026kill them all\u2026what a horrible tragedy it will be. But then you realize something! You realize that you can switch the trolley car onto a different track\u2026an adjacent track! You know those little junctions switches that they have on train tracks\u2026you can pull the lever and the train switches tracks? You can pull one of those! But just as soon as you realize you can switch tracks\u2026you realize that on that new track\u2026is just one person who is completely unaware of what's going on and will inevitably get turned into a trolley pancake if you so decide to switch the tracks. What do you do? Do you allow the trolley to kill the five people\u2026or do you switch the tracks and kill the one person? What decision would you make in that moment? Well, I have no doubt given just the type of people who listen to this show\u2026there are a lot of creative answers out there about what to do here\u2026but if we're speaking just statistically here\u2026most people say that in this moment what they would do is pull the lever\u2026switch the tracks and favor killing the one person over the five. And this is a totally understandable decision. In fact, come to think of it\u2026I can get on board with this. I would pull that lever. I'm not confused about morality anymore. I'm not afraid anymore! After all, one person dying is a much better outcome than five people dying, right? I mean, to me this seems REALLY straightforward\u2026if you had the opportunity to, why wouldn't you save the five? I'm sure you remember from last episode, what I'm doing here is I'm looking at the situation through the eyes of a consequentialist. If you wanted to go further I might be looking at it through the eyes of a utilitarian. Utilitarianism is a specific type of consequentialism developed by a guy named Jeremy Bentham\u2026refined by a guy named John Stuart Mill\u2026but the fundamental idea at it's core is something we've talked about on this podcast going all the way back to the Hellenistic period with the Epicureans. The idea being that what is right or what is good is always the action where the consequences of that action maximizes utility. Hence the name: utilitarianism. What is utility you may ask. Utility can be a lot of different things from emotional well-being, economic well-being, limitation of suffering\u2026but most of the time people just define it as pleasure. This is a very simple idea that sounds absolutely incredible on the surface\u2026Jeremy Bentham looked at nature\u2026much like the Epicureans and he realized that \"Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters: pain and pleasure. Human action can be distilled down into an avoidance of pain and the pursuit of pleasure\" To a utilitarian, the right decision in any situation is the one where the consequences insure the greatest amount of utility to the greatest number of people. The right thing to do is the thing that maximizes happiness for the greatest number of people! So back to the trolley car example\u2026sounds like I'm a utilitarian right? After all, it seems very straightforward what the right decision is\u2026I would pull the lever to kill the one person in favor of killing the five people\u2026if we\u2019re judging the right or wrong decision in terms of it bringing the greatest utility to the greatest number of people\u2026then killing one to save five is a no brainer! I gotta be honest with you guys\u2026it feels good being confident in where I stand morally. It\u2019s kinda nice just being able to pull levers and kill people with impunity\u2026Finally I have a group to attach myself to! It's been so many years of searching\u2026.finally I can buy a T-shirt and be a member of a team! But then inevitably philosophy throws us a monkey wrench. Then the trolley car problem takes a turn and asks you to consider a slightly different scenario. This time, imagine you\u2019re still in the general vicinity of the trolley tracks but now you\u2019re up on a bridge\u2026a bridge that overlooks the tracks. While looking down and observing you notice a very similar situation unfolding except this time there\u2019s only one track. There\u2019s five oblivious people a couple hundred feet away from a runaway trolley and it seems in the moment like there\u2019s nothing you can do to save the five people from certain death\u2026when all of a sudden you look over to your right and you notice something. There\u2019s a fat guy standing next to you leaning over the side of the bridge to get a look at what\u2019s going on. Now I realize this may seem slightly ridiculous\u2026but in the thought experiment we\u2019re supposed to imagine that this guy is not just your run of the mill fat guy\u2026but grotesquely fat\u2026so fat that you could push him over the bridge\u2026he would fall to his death\u2026but his sheer size would produce a shock-wave on the ground\u2026which would alert the five people on the track and slow down the train enough for them to get out of the way and the five people would be saved. Do you push the fat man over the bridge to save the five? Well I gotta be honest\u2026now I'm starting to not have as much fun going through the process of this thought experiment\u2026I mean I recently converted to utilitarianism and now I'm starting to have a crisis of faith. As a good utilitarian\u2026if I'm just looking at the consequences of my actions and whether they bring the greatest amount of utility to the greatest number of people\u2026well the answer seems cut and dry here as well. Without question the answer is to push my size-able friend over to my right\u2026over the bridge and kill him to save the five. But it just feels wrong. Statistically speaking, most people after being advocates of pulling the lever in the first scenario would never even think of pushing the fat guy over the bridge\u2026.and I seem to fall into the same category. Why do I feel different about this scenario? What, really, is the difference between the two situations. Now obviously there ARE differences between the two or you couldn't ask the question what's the difference between these two things, but really let's think about it\u2026in both cases\u2026 your behavior remains remarkably similar\u2026you are actively sentencing one innocent person to death in the name of saving five innocent people. Now it's tempting to give all sorts of rebuttals here\u2026yeah I was down for pulling the lever before\u2026when my actions only involved only people who were already on the tracks to begin with\u2026these people were in harms way\u2026to push the guy over the bridge is to put an innocent bystander in harms way just so that I can save five people\u2026that's not fair! But is that true? In the original example\u2026was the one person that you opted to kill in harms way BEFORE you pulled the lever? They had no reason to assume the train would take an unexpected diversion at the last second onto their track that was otherwise completely safe\u2026they were completely OUT of harms way until you decided to pull the lever and PUT them into harms way. If it weren't for your decision to pull the lever\u2026that track was as benign as standing on a bridge overlooking the tracks. Another rebuttal might be\u2026well pushing someone over the side of a bridge is much different than merely pulling a lever! In one case you're just pulling a lever and something happens after you pull that lever\u2026in the other case\u2026you're physically putting your hands on the guy and forcing him over the side of a bridge. That physical contact makes it MUCH different! But is it really the physical contact that makes it different? I would argue that it's not. What if instead of pushing the guy over the side you could pull a lever that would launch him out of some sort of medieval trebuchet and the same thing would happen\u2026he'd go onto the tracks\u2026would you feel morally justified to do that? Personally, I wouldn't and I think if this illustrates anything its that there must be something else at work here\u2026something other than just the physical contact that makes us think this is wrong. I think most people would say that regardless of the consequences\u2026there is something unique about pushing the fat guy over the bridge that is \"just wrong\"\u2026something that isn't present in the lever pulling example. Now the really fascinating thing here that we should all take from this is not that we make different decisions in different individual situations\u2026that's obvious. The interesting thing is that I started out pretty confident in my decision making about pulling the lever\u2026I cited very clear reasons for WHY what I did was okay in that situation\u2026and then with just a few minor tweaks to the circumstances\u2026I started to revise my entire moral foundation. I started giving different reasons\u2026which either makes me ignorant..a liar\u2026a hypocrite\u2026or more likely\u2026it implies that the reason I gave for why I made the FIRST decision to pull the lever was not the REAL reason why I did it. There's something more complicated at work here. What is that thing? There have been many attempts to answer this question over the years. As we talked about last time\u2026a deontologist would say that regardless of what the consequences of our actions will be\u2026or inaction in this case\u2026although the consequences are bad\u2026some things are just wrong. Like, for instance, pushing an innocent fat guy over the side of a bridge. Let's get one thing clear..in both scenarios\u2026if we do nothing\u2026five people die. There's no getting around that. And just you knowing the certain outcome in either situation instantly implicates you\u2026 and it leaves you in a place where you need to make a choice. Doing nothing does not absolve you from any guilt. Consequentialists would say that the ends justify the means\u2026but a Deontologist\u2026someone like Immanuel Kant would say that you should never use people as means to some end. When you push the innocent fat man over the side of the bridge\u2026you are using that guy as a means to some end that you aim to achieve\u2026and that is wrong. Immanuel Kant talks about the ideal society that we could live in as what he calls a \"Kingdom of Ends\"\u2026where every person is viewed not as a means to some end\u2026or a pawn in someone else's game that they're playing where they can say \"the ends justify the means\"\u2026every person is an \"end in themselves\" as Kant says. Now we'll talk in a second more fully about why this point that Kant's making is important\u2026but first let's talk about how he may have responded to the apparent contradiction between me thinking its okay to pull the lever to kill someone and save five people\u2026vs me thinking its wrong to push the fat guy off the bridge to save five people. See Kant was smart. He recognized that it would be very easy\u2026 to mistake whatever cultural norms or traditions or circumstances you were born into\u2026 for a good, solid moral foundation. You know\u2026not many people would think that chopping someones hands off would be a proper punishment for someone that stole a Snickers bar, but if Snickers bars existed in Babylonia you might find quite a few people that disagreed with you at the time. So to circumvent this transient, subjective moral trap that we might otherwise fall into\u2026as we talked about last episode\u2026Kant thinks that just like our objective conception of reality itself is based on a priori concepts of reason\u2026our morals too can be based on a priori concepts of reason. Now think about what this means for a second\u2026this doesn't just mean that these moral principles need to be appropriate for every human in every time period and in every circumstance\u2026but for these things to be TRULY valid\u2026they need to done purely from a place of being moral. For example\u2026from the last episode the kid that only cleans his room because his mom told him he'd get an ice cream cone if he did so\u2026that's not good enough for Kant. So given these criteria\u2026 that Kant's laid out for what a moral action can be\u2026let's try to come up with a few. What are some moral principles that fit all of these criteria? Can you think of any? Cause I can't. I mean this is a pretty intense set of restrictions to put on the process\u2026Kant's obviously taking these moral principles seriously. See Kant argues that if you're ever doing ANYTHING in this world\u2026any action you take is going to be done at a particular place in time\u2026yielding to a particular set of circumstances\u2026considering a particular history given your own particular personality. Think about this point he's making\u2026these elements of ANY ACTION WE TAKE are inescapable aspects of our existence. This is the reason why he looks to things that are \"prior to experience\"\u2026you know prior to tradition\u2026prior to circumstances\u2026prior to your personality\u2026it's for this reason that Kant says that the only things that would fit this rigorous set of criteria are a priori. The moral principles that I should adhere to when determining whether to push the fat guy over the bridge or not must be a priori in nature. Remember\u2026moral action is determined by reason for Kant\u2026reason is the same in all rational beings regardless of time period or culture\u2026so because REASON is universal\u2026morality TOO should be universal. So once you arrive here as Kant you still have a pretty difficult task ahead of you. Well where Kant goes from here\u2026his solution to the problem is what he calls his \"categorical imperative\". Two really cool sounding words that if you break them down individually\u2026actually do explain exactly what Kant's talking about with his categorical imperative. Categorical meaning explicit or applying across all categories\u2026and Imperative meaning essential or necessary. An essential rule of morality that applies across every situation, culture, time period, set of experiences\u2026you name it. Now, Kant gives multiple formulations of his categorical imperative\u2026but by far the most famous one is this: \"There is \u2026 only a single categorical imperative and it is this: Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" What Kant's saying here is that before you do anything\u2026consider something for a second\u2026consider for a second what the world would be like if literally every other person in the entire world acted as you did in that situation. Really imagine it. And if that world is not something that you're willing to deal with or if it would be a direct contradiction for that world to exist or if that world would be filled with chaos\u2026then you shouldn't do whatever it is you were considering doing. Let's think of a few examples of what he's talking about here. Someone cuts you off in traffic\u2026what do you do\u2026well if you decide to chase the guy down and kill him\u2026Kant would want you to ask\u2026how would the world look if every time someone got cut off in traffic\u2026the person that got cut off chased the person down and killed them? The world would be absolute chaos\u2026people would be terrified of driving\u2026and heaven forbid you lose focus on the road for a couple seconds and accidentally cut someone off! But how about something less extreme. You're drinking a coke outside of a supermarket waiting for a ride somewhere\u2026you finish your bottle and you decide instead of walking all the way to the trashcan\u2026you're just gonna leave it on the ground by where you were standing. Someone will get it eventually, right? Well if we apply Kant's categorical imperative to this example\u2026the world would be an ocean of coke bottles. Think if 7 billion people just left their trash wherever they were when they got done using it\u2026just think of how that world would look. Aside from us existing in a perpetual revolving trashcan\u2026think of the burden to the average taxpayer\u2026including you! We'd have to spend millions and millions of your hard earned dollars on teams of people constantly patrolling around picking up people's trash\u2026it would be madness! This is the sort of thinking behind why Kant thinks it's a bad idea to lie! It's just downright illogical. Because if we existed in a world where all anyone ever did was lie\u2026then everyone would always know that they were being lied to. So they would never be deceived. But that's the point of a lie\u2026to deceive people\u2026so it logically would be pointless. Contrast that with a world when everyone always told the truth\u2026and nothing would be wrong with that world picture. So I want to tie all this together into a neat package. To Kant when considering whether to push the innocent fat guy off the bridge in order to save the five innocent people on the track\u2026in fact when we want to consider whether moral principles of any kind hold water\u2026he would want us to consider these five things. Number 1. Reason. Our actions need to be guided by our own reason, not our senses or our experiences or our cultural norms or anything like that. 2. It needs to be Autonomous. We need to be acting freely\u2026and in order to be acting freely we need to not be enslaved to some overseer decreeing a moral law for us to follow or enslaved to some ice cream cone that we might get if we do something moral. 3. we need to treat ourselves and others as ends in themselves\u2026not means to some end that we want to achieve. We can't manipulate people or lie to people because when we do that\u2026we are, by definition withholding valuable information from them so that they will make a decision that they might not otherwise make if they had all the facts. In this way\u2026you are ROBBING them of their ability to make a fully rational choice\u2026and in a way\u2026robbing them of some piece of their humanity. 4. we should act only in accordance with moral principles where we'd be satisfied if they were made into a universal maxim\u2026i.e. if everyone did this thing, how would the world look? 5. we should strive to live in the kingdom of ends\u2026which is too complicated for this 5 bullet point format I created on the fly, but it has to do with the political implications of all this stuff. So it's very easy to be dismissive of thought experiments or asking ourselves questions about why we make the moral judgments we do\u2026but the advantages of putting yourself through these thought experiments are more than just understanding yourself better or living a more fulfilling life\u2026these things inevitably extend to every decision we make as a society about what is right or wrong. See it's so tempting to say that \"murder is wrong\"\u2026or \"stealing is wrong\"\u2026or I'm just going to pull the lever and kill the one person instead of the five and that's just common sense\u2026no need to consider any other alternatives\u2026no need to understand what I base my moral judgments on. Well, maybe that's good enough for you\u2026but the reality is that the world at large isn't always that black and white. See\u2026things like murder trials and economic policy and whether to become involved in a war or what a just war is at all or foreign policy or civil rights\u2026the ethical decisions at the root of these massive issues\u2026these aren't things that you can just adhere to moral commandments about\u2026these things aren't as simple as just.. a guy steals an ox from his neighbor and we need to punish him let's consult our RULES\u2026the world is filled with millions of nuanced grey areas that need to be accounted for. Yes\u2026 sometimes the only thing that's at stake is your time\u2026Yes, sometimes it's just some stupid podcast asking you to be whisked away into a fantasy world\u2026but in other cases\u2026its only by considering these details and this minutia that we can get a more accurate understanding of what we really value as a species\u2026 to understand why we REALLY pulled that lever\u2026it's for the times when literally millions of lives might hang in the balance including yours. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_53": {"date": "2015-6-1", "text": "Posted on June 1, 2015\nEpisode 60 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #060\u00a0on The Sublime. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm gonna be really straight forward with you guys\u2026I have no idea what it is we're even talking about today. Really, it's something to marvel at\u2026for the next 30 minutes I'm going to talk into this microphone right in front of me and I'm going to tell you a story that is impossible to tell. I'm going to tell you about a very mysterious thing\u2026its a thing that has captivated generations\u2026it's a thing that has consumed men much greater than myself for their entire lives.\nThis is a mystery that I've been fascinated with for years\u2026I've read entire books on the subject\u2026I've read first hand testimonies\u2026essays\u2026eye witness accounts\u2026and despite all of this\u2026to be completely honest\u2026I couldn't even tell you exactly what it is, I certainly have never EXPERIENCED it before\u2026and if you just look at things statistically speaking I will probably die\u2026I will probably be lowered into a hole in the ground in a pine box one day without a full understanding of what this thing actually is.\u00a0\nBut you wanna know what keeps me going people? It's the simple fact that I'm no the only one\u2026You may say that I am stupid. But I'm not the only one. No, in fact I find solace in the fact\u2026 that the thing we're discussing today is so elusive, so profound and so incredibly subjective\u2026that quite literally\u2026there is no one who has ever lived\u2026 or will ever live that could EVER in audio podcast form\u2026convey to you what this concept means fully.\u00a0\nAnd that's because the thing we're talking about today is by definition ineffable. Now in case if you don't read the dictionary every night before you go to bed\u2026Ineffable is fancy philosophical lingo to describe something that is so great, and so above comparison that the very construct of human language is not capable of describing it.\u00a0\nAnd really this shouldn't be THAT controversial of a topic at this point in the show. We've talked about on the show time and time again about this imperfect thing called language that we humans have created\u2026we've talked about just terrible this thing is sometimes at describing even the most basic things.\nYou know, it's good enough to do MOST things we do on a daily basis\u2026it's good enough to convey basic things\u2026asking the person across the table from you to please pass the salt\u2026that's something it can do\nIt's good enough to convey feelings of basic emotional states of mind\u2026you know I think you are a very beautiful girl you should go on a date with me\u2026these are emotional states that we have in our head that language is pretty decent at conveying\u2026its good enough\u2026 to plant in the other person's head what we are feeling or experiencing in a given moment.\nIt's good at doing some things, but is it that crazy to think that language cant describe everything there is out there? That maybe language not capable of describing certain things? That at least potentially there is something out there in the universe that is so great, so powerful, so immense that these things that we call nouns, adjectives and verbs are just not capable of conveying the greatness, power or immensity of that thing? Is that possible?\n\nNow as you can probably guess, typically people assign this ineffability to the idea that they have of something like God, right? But we've seen it used in other areas on this podcast before. You know\u2026Laozi and the Dao \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao\" \u2026 Plotinus and his conception of \"The One\"\u2026 When Plotinus and Laozi were talking about these concepts, they prefaced all of it by saying\u2026 that to even try to categorize the essence of these things with words\u2026 would be a huge mistake. See, language is good at some things\u2026but it has its limitations. To deny that fact would be hubris. To deny that fact would be human arrogance.\u00a0\nWell, the thing we're talking about today is one of these ineffable things that is completely beyond human description\u2026it has become known to history and the generations of people who have tried to come into contact with it as: the sublime. Now, we don't know much for sure about the sublime. We know that it exists. We know that people claim to come into contact with this thing whatever it is, we know that they typically come into contact with it when they are out in the wilderness somewhere\u2026distantly secluded somewhere\u2026usually when they feel like their life is imminently in danger\u2026we know that people spanning across many different cultures and time periods claim to have had similar sublime experiences\u2026so what is this thing?\nNow at this point whats common for people to do that hear the words I just said is to try to simplify this concept down into things they're already familiar with, right? Like, they'll hear that this is some sort of unique, powerful, ineffable elusive experience and immediately jump to the conclusion \"oh when people talk about having one of these sublime experiences\u2026they're just talking about having some sort of run of the mill transcendent religious experience\u2026they think they're communicating with God or something\u2026No\u2026that's not what this is.\u00a0\nSome interpretations of sublime experiences do talk about feeling at one with nature or God or whatever you want to call it\u2026 but if one thing seems clear about these experiences that people have had over the generations it's that\u2026 that would only be one specific interpretation of a sublime experience.\u00a0\nNow, i'm telling you alot right now about what the sublime ISN'T\u2026maybe the best way to begin telling you about what it is, is by talking about the conditions that people are in when they have these sublime experiences\u2026maybe I should just give you an example. And I'm here to tell you that historically speaking\u2026by far the most common thing that people have used to illustrate the sublime\u2026a motif that's used time and time again across all generations and cultures\u2026is a ship lost at sea hopelessly caught in a horrible storm in the ocean. Just imagine that scene real quick.\nSee, I want you to picture it because there's a reason why these sublime experiences typically happen when people are out in the wilderness\u2026the REASON why is because to produce one of these sublime experiences\u2026you first need to perceive something powerful beyond measure. Greatness beyond anything you could ever possibly calculate.\u00a0\nThe reason these things typically happen in the wilderness is not because there's some magical connection between humans and nature\u2026but because nature is typically the only thing we have \u2026capable\u2026 of producing something that is so beyond human thought or \u00a0capability or familiarity to be able to produce this sort of intense emotional state.\u00a0\nSo knowing that, it's no wonder that from the very beginning, from the very first philosopher to ever reference the sublime\u2026his name was Longinus he lived in the first century AD and it's no wonder that when he talks about the sublime\u2026 he uses the ocean\u2026 as an example of something that has this level of magnitude that would be required to produce a sublime experience. He says:\n\"Hence it is almost an instinct that we follow in giving our admiration, not to small streams, though they be pellucid and useful, but to the Nile and Danube, or Rhine, and far more to the Ocean\"\nWhat Longinus is saying here in the first work EVER created on this subject of the sublime\u2026is that how fitting that we look at a stream\u2026or a lake or a babbling brook\u2026and it's nice. They're pretty. You might sit down and have a picnic by one, or use one to travel down in a canoe. But man there's just a different feeling you get when you look at one of the giant rivers like the Nile right? The turbulent white rapids\u2026the inertia of the water. Even more than that, Longinus says\u2026what about the ocean? When you compare those feelings\u2026when you compare the way you feel between when you look at a little stream flowing through the park\u2026and the ocean! What a difference there is! I mean, the ocean is a great example of something that has this sort of greatness beyond calculation\u2026that raw power! We don't marvel at lakes and streams. We marvel at oceans.\u00a0\nFor the sake of understanding why the ocean is such a great catalyst for having one of these sublime experiences\u2026let's talk about the ocean real quick. I realize at this point it's a comedic bit that's been beaten into the ground, but the ocean is one of the most terrifying places you could ever possibly be. If someone paid me a billion dollars to write a horror genre book creating a world scarier than the ocean\u2026I would still be eating top ramen. I could never do it. Just think about the monsters that fly around in there! A jellyfish can accidentally rub up against your leg and you're dead. You could stub your toe on the wrong coral reef and just be dead. There's something off-putting about the fact that a shark will rip you to pieces with that lifeless stare in its eyes and never even have a thought cross his mind about whether that was a morally acceptable thing to do or not. Your opposable thumbs do nothing in the ocean. You are at the bottom of the food chain. Whenever you decide to go on a visit to the ocean\u2026you have to keep a portion of yourself above water at all times just so that you can breath and not be killed by the ocean!\nBut aside from that\u2026there's a certain eternal quality to the ocean isn't there? You can go to the beach and sit on the sidelines and just watch the ocean slam up against the rocks\u2026over\u2026and over and over. Endlessly. The waves never stop. The ocean doesn't wake up in the morning and need a pep talk to motivate itself to do what it does\u2026no it's moving and shifting because of a constant and necessary law of the universe\u2026the law of gravity. Just consider that every second you're listening to this podcast\u2026when you're graduating high school, when you're getting married, when you're playing video games, when you're checking the mail\u2026when your mind is elsewhere the ocean is still there. Wave after wave relentlessly slamming against those jagged rocks with the weight of the ocean behind it. With the power to erode the earth away. Any one of those waves could kill you. Any one of those waves could suck you under never to be seen again. Consider in that moment if you were up against those rocks how futile your attempts would be to resist the ocean.\u00a0\nNow for the sake of time I will stop\u2026but I could honestly go on waxing poetic about the greatness of the ocean for probably about an hour before I got bored of myself talking. The point is: The ocean is without a doubt an incredible thing. For some reason\u2026I really enjoy thinking about it\u2026 raw power, about how easily it could chew me up and spit me out without even batting an eyelash because it is that powerful. As morbid as it may be on the surface\u2026It is truly awe inspiring. Even if you think the ocean is lame and boring\u2026I'd hope that you can at least understand where my feelings are coming from\u2026that considering and thinking about the sheer greatness of the ocean can at least potentially be a source of pleasure.\nSo given all this enormous power of the ocean\u2026this power beyond our ability to calculate its no surprise that its something Longinus suspected all the way back in the first century might have been at least one piece of the puzzle when it comes to having these elusive sublime experiences \u2026But it's not like in his work Longinus laid out exactly what the sublime was\u2026there was still a great deal of mystery surrounding the whole concept.\u00a0\nI mean, how can we even know for sure whether people were having these experiences? How can we know whether they're not just going crazy out in the wilderness\u2026or if they're just vying for attention from the public claiming to have some special experience? Collectively as a species we were confused for a long time and what people started to do, is they got tired of being in this state of confusion and they tried to get to the bottom of it\u2026and they used their own bodies as the petri dishes.\u00a0\nWhat people started to do is head out into the wilderness not in spite of these sublime experiences\u2026but in SEARCH of them! People would just head out into the woods\u2026into the mountains looking to have one of these sublime experiences. If and when they did\u2026they would record their findings and shine at least a little beam of light on something that was largely a mystery up until this point. What a noble sacrifice!\nBut if you're a miserable skeptic like me\u2026the first thing you think when these people talk about doing this is well, never underestimate the minds ability to think somethings true that it wants to be true. What I'm saying is, these people don't seem like the best neutral third parties to be conducting these unbiased experiments about the sublime. They WANT to be having sublime experiences\u2026if you want to go into the woods and are looking to find big foot, your mind will inevitably find a way to justify and distort what you saw to reinforce that fact. If you WANT to look into the sky and see aliens flying around, it becomes much easier to find some mysterious light you can identify as extra terrestrial. Which is why to me\u2026the most FASCINATING and persuasive of ALL the accounts of the sublime are the ones recorded by people that weren't going out with the intention of HAVING a sublime experience\u2026they sort of accidentally stumbled upon a sublime experience.\u00a0\nThere are thousands of pages of diaries written by adventurers crossing the alps in the 17 and 1800s. Now, the alps, as far as a mountain range is concerned\u2026just type \"the alps\" into google images and you'll see what I mean\u2026you look at these mountains and they are absolutely beautiful beyond words but as you look at them\u2026 you can just picture yourself as a little speck on the side of one of these mountains and you cant help but notice how treacherous it must be trying to navigate up there, let alone in the 1700s. If\u2026 two of the ingredients in this recipe for a sublime experience are greatness beyond measure and a fear for your own life\u2026well crossing the alps in the 1700's must have been like a hotbed for growing these sublime experiences.\u00a0\nYou read these accounts by the people that managed to catalog their emotions when crossing the alps\u2026you begin to feel the emotions they felt\u2026two of the most famous for their accounts of the sublime were John Dennis and Joseph Addison\u2026and both of them when you read their diaries describe the EXACT same sort of feeling!\u00a0\nDennis talks about this psychological tightrope that he was walking the whole trip\u2026torn between delight at the landscape but delight that was \"mingled with horrors, sometimes almost with despair.\" Addison talks about having the same seemingly paradoxical feelings as he's braving the alps\u2026he famously said \"The alps fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror!\"\nWhat are they talking about here? They seem to be taking pleasure in the landscape, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows in the Swiss Alps. It SEEMS counter intuitive! How can you be mingled with horror, but still somehow\u2026 be unquestionably deriving pleasure from the experience? What these diaries show us, if anything, is the beginning of what seems to be a completely different way of aesthetically judging the world, while getting pleasure from the experience, that has nothing to do with beauty.\u00a0\nAnd this right here, is the exact reason why the sublime is such a fascinating concept to me personally, because when I first read about this and realized that we're talking about potentially a different way of aesthetically judging the world different from beauty\u2026perhaps mutually exclusive from beauty, it just completely blew my mind. So just to be sure we don't gloss over this point, let me explain why this is such a big deal.\nSee, as you know from this podcast aesthetically judging the world was nothing new at this point\u2026it had been talked about ad nauseium in the past. Plato talks in the Symposium the Philebus\u2026we can all relate to the experience of looking out at the world\u2026finding something beautiful and it doesn't seem that controversial to say that the thing that differentiates something from being beautiful or not beautiful in my experience is that\u2026oh when i look at this thing that's beautiful it brings me some kind of pleasure however marginal that makes me attracted to it. Now the natural conclusion to jump to there is that if seeing a beautiful thing brings me pleasure and that's part of the reason I am attracted to beautiful things\u2026then the inverse must be true as well, right? Ugly things must bring me some small level of pain which is why I recoil from them.\u00a0\nI kinda feel bad for \"ugliness\" if that's even a thing. Why did \"ugliness\" get such a bad rap in the world? People like St. Augustine went so far as to say that really ugliness doesn't even exist\u2026see for him when we perceive something beautiful\u2026what we're seeing is God's fingerprints on his creation and that when we call something ugly\u2026really what we're seeing is just an ABSENCE of God's goodness, not a quality in itself. I'm sure you can see the striking similarities to Plotinus's theodicy.\u00a0\nBut for me\u2026this is a pretty awesome assumption that Edmund Burke's calling into question when he writes his work on the sublime\u2026why is the inverse necessarily true? Why does ugliness necessarily have to be painful? Why does ugliness have to not exist at all? Once you start calling these things into question\u2026it opens up a whole other barrel of monkeys\u2026can we derive pleasure from looking at ugly things? Forget about ugliness for a second\u2026can we derive pleasure from some OTHER type of aesthetic experience\u2026from something OTHER than looking at beautiful things?\u00a0\nThe Sublime, to Edmund Burke is a very strange type of pleasure that we get from feeling as though our lives are in danger while coming into contact with these things like the ocean that are powerful beyond calculation\u2026not too much in danger, you still have to be able to feel that strange delight! Burke says that too much danger just makes it into a terrible experience\u2026no there's this Goldilocks zone of an attack on your instinct of self-preservation that when at the right place at the right time can bring you a sort of pleasureful distress. You're in imminent danger by this thing that is powerful beyond measure, but at some deep level you know that you're going to be fine\u2026you know you're at arms length from this thing\u2026and it brings you a weird kind of pleasure being in contact with that greatness. You can imagine being a ship caught in a storm. You can imagine being a traveler in the 1700's crossing the alps.\u00a0\nThe sublime to Burke is visceral. It's not based on some intellectual calculation that we're making\u2026it's not like beauty where we look at some thing and weigh it up against all the other beautiful things we've seen in our life and make a judgement about whether it's beautiful and if we find it beautiful we just sit there and enjoy it for a while\u2026you know the tastemaker that Hume talks about\u2026where you use your mind to cultivate these skills of judging beautiful things.\nNo the sublime is something different\u2026it's something deep within us\u2026it's a part of what makes us human\u2026very different than beauty. Burke talks about beauty being something that brings the mind inaction\u2026it doesn't stimulate the mind\u2026you find beauty and you sit back and enjoy it. No, on the contrary Burke says that the mind SWELLS when it encounters the sublime. The Sublime to Burke is a much more real, much more important type of aesthetic judgement:\n\nThis idea of the sublime being a more real, non-intellectual, more natural version of aesthetically judging the world was a massively appealing concept during Burke's time. Remember, this is the enlightenment\u2026there is this intense momentum moving in the direction of using reason as the guide for human progress\u2026of using empirical observation and arriving at truths of fact. And in response to this there was a push back by people\u2026they thought we were going to far with all this reason stuff\u2026there was this populist uprising fueled by the ideas of Rousseau and many others called Romanticism that loved the idea of the Sublime. There are stories of dozens of ordinary people that had no business pretending to be a mountaineer\u2026being led into the mountains trying to achieve one of these sublime experiences\u2026and many of them ended up dying!\u00a0\nThe point is: you can see how attractive this idea of the Sublime was back then\u2026there was a hysteria that people connected to it. It really was like the 1700's version of Beatle-mania. Artists everywhere during this time and artists ever since have tried to take this incredible, profound experience of sublimity\u2026and encapsulate it in the form of a painting. Or of a poem. Or of a song. Artists for hundreds and hundreds of years have tried to use their art to not give people something BEAUTIFUL to feast their eyes on\u2026but to evoke a sublime experience! This new type of aesthetic judgement! Check out the series of paintings The Horse and Lion by George Stubbs if you want to see an incredible example of someone attempting to evoke a sublime experience in the viewer\u2026George Stubbs was actually a friend of Edmund Burke so he had an understanding of the concept that not many people were privy to at the time.\u00a0\nSo here's the question you've all been considering the whole time you've been listening to this\u2026have you ever had a sublime experience in the way Edmund Burke describes? Well, as I said at the beginning of the show\u2026I haven't. I have no idea what this guy's talking about\u2026and when I say that I mean I can't relate FULLY to what this guy's talking about\u2026because we can all relate to the idea of getting some sort of strange pleasure out of recounting ugly or life-threatening things from the past right?\u00a0\nLike, my dad was in the military, first Gulf War. He was a good American. And it was interesting because when he got home it seemed like whenever he came across anyone who had ever seen combat before like he had, they would sit down, have a beer and talk about what their units did\u2026the sort of missions they went on\u2026they'd sit there and recount intimate, gruesome details about the terrible things they'd seen in combat.\u00a0\nI remember one time I was a fly on the wall to this whole process and this guy was telling a story\u2026we were walking through the trees\u2026this kid stepped on a bouncin' betty and all of a sudden I got this 17 yr old kid holding his detached leg in his hands saying what do I do sarge? I said, boy you know what to do\u2026take off your bootlace\u2026make yourself a tourniquet.\u00a0\nThis guy was telling this story in the most cavalier voice you'd ever heard\u2026like he was standing in line at subway talking to his friend about his job. And my dad was sitting there nodding like he was just enjoying the story. Yes, I too remember the day I had to take off a bootlace and make a tourniquet out of it.\u00a0\nNow of course people join support groups and they talk to each other and they find relief discussing the terrible things that they've witnessed in wartime, but this specific case was different and I don't think it's entirely uncommon. If you asked these guys what the most traumatic horrible things they'd ever seen were they would undoubtedly point to what they saw during their years in the military, yet they take advantage of every opportunity they get to relive those moments in their heads over and over again.\u00a0\nIt doesn't seem like they're talking about these things so that one day they can come to terms with them and never have to think about them again\u2026it seems like there is some peace that it brings them, some strange pleasure that they get by recounting a horrible situation where their lives were in danger but knowing at some level that they are at arms length from it now. Could these horrible events be one of the rare exceptions of something not produced by nature that's powerful enough to produce one of these sublime experiences?\nOne of the main points Edmund Burke makes about the Sublime in his work is the idea that the Sublime is not just a greater level of beauty that we can only find in nature. What I mean by that is that its not like I look at a beautiful flower\u2026I look at a beautiful house\u2026and when I look out at the ocean it's just SO incredibly beautiful that it evokes this sublime experience\u2026No, to Edmund Burke\u2026the beautiful and the sublime are mutually exclusive. The Sublime to Burke is a much more real, much more important type of aesthetic judgement:\n\"If Taste has no fixed principles, if the imagination is not affected according to some invariable and certain laws, our labour\u2026 must be judged an useless\u2026 undertaking\u2026. to set up for a legislator of whims and fancies.\u201d\nSee, to Burke it's not just enough to look out at a calm ocean\u2026he actually says explicitly \u2018These waters must be troubled before they can exert their virtues\u2019.\u00a0\nWell this brings us to Immanuel Kant\u2026who is in my opinion the second greatest commentator ever on the sublime. Second only to a man named Arthur Schopenhauer who were gonna be talking about soon\u2026but now were brought up to speed on this idea of the Sublime. Oddly enough\u2026we know how little we know about this thing called the sublime at this point in history\u2026.how mysterious it is\u2026And I guess what I'm saying is that I have good news for you either way:\nIf you hated this episode, then the good news: it's going to be about a dozen episodes until we talk about this concept of the sublime again.\nIf you loved this episode or are as fascinated as I am by these elusive, mysterious, truly undefinable sublime experiences\u2026then you got an absolutely EPIC episode to look forward to when we talk about Kant and Schopenhauer and how they changed the way I look at everything in the world. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_54": {"date": "2015-6-14", "text": "Posted on June 14, 2015\nEpisode 61 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #061 on What is Enlightenment? Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn a cold, dark, cloud covered night in the year 1783 a small handful of European revolutionaries gathered together in secret to discuss their future plans. They called themselves the Wednesday Society.\u00a0\nNow I know what you're thinking: Wednesday society\u2026not a very good name for an ominous, revolutionary secret society\u2026well that's because there was nothing ominous going on at these secret meetings at all! Wednesday was just the day of the week that they met on. They also called themselves the \"friends of the enlightenment!\" It was friendly secret society\u2026they gathered together every week in solidarity\u2026 in support of this enlightenment that was going on. They talked about the good the bad\u2026potential mistakes to avoid. These people had the presence of mind to realize that they were immersed in the middle of a massive cultural movement. It was like a big pro-enlightenment support group that they were a part of.\n\n\nIn fact, two of the members of this secret society were editors and founders of a super pro-enlightenment magazine slash journal slash periodical collection of pro-enlightenment ideas. Like, do you guys ever wonder what the opinion section of the newspaper was like hundreds of years ago? I do. I read this stuff sometimes. It's so cool to see what kinds of questions the average person thought were worth asking back then\u2026given where and when they lived in history. What did they think were the most pressing issues facing them during their time. What's even MORE fascinating most of the time is just how similar the things they worried about are to the things WE worry about\u2026it's fascinating how many of the questions they asked\u2026we still haven't resolved. This may be one of those questions.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, one of these two editors and founders of this magazine was named Johann Biester\u2026now Johann Biester in the year 1783 anonymously published an essay in this magazine of his\u2026 where the title of the essay was: Proposal not to engage the clergy any longer when marriages are conducted. Now\u2026it's pretty obvious what the point of the essay was\u2026and this kind of thinking was a hallmark of the enlightenment. See Biester's writing this essay and he's very self aware of where he fits in to the context of history. As I said before\u2026these guys KNEW they were smack dab in the middle of the massive cultural shift. They were very aware of the momentum of society moving in the direction of more secular institutions\u2026the church was no longer the moral authority of the world\u2026the church was increasingly become less and less influential in terms of government\u2026so what this article aimed to do is ask a very natural next question: what about marriage? Marriage certainly in the past has been an exclusively religious ceremony\u2026you know\u2026being bound together in holy matrimony under the eyes of our lord Jesus Christ and his partner in crime God, but why is marriage a religious ceremony?\u00a0\nWhy does the church have to have a monopoly over this\u2026why can't it be a civil ceremony? Why can't it be something that the government does? After all, aside from the moral implications\u2026aside from the belief that it's a moral thing to do to commit yourself to one person for the rest of your life\u2026people getting married is actually a pretty good thing for a government too, right? I mean, a married person\u2026is a stable person. It's a person that has something to lose. It's a person that probably, by and large, is going to be thinking about their family and because of that will probably become a stable, monogamous, productive tax-paying member of society\u2026paying into the very tax pool that funds the government. If you're the government, why WOULDN'T you give someone a tax break to get married\u2026marriage is a loss leader for you! Eventually you're getting your money back one way or another.\u00a0\nThe point is, and the point of Biester's essay was: why do clergy somehow have a monopoly over marriage\u2026why can't marriage be something else\u2026something that's say, a civil procedure\u2026carried out by a judge\u2026overseen by the state. Well, we all know who eventually won this argument, but that's not the point of the episode today. As you can imagine, at the time that the essay was released\u2026not everyone agreed with removing this power from the hands of clergymen\u2026many of them were of a religious bent themselves\u2026one of them in particular named Reverend Johann Zollner responded to this anonymously written essay with a question\u2026a very good question. It was a question that was so good and so necessary to answer at the time that I don't think Reverend Zollner could've ever predicted the level of response he was going to get.\nSee, Zollner was a proponent of the enlightenment himself\u2026but he looked at THIS article in particular and he just thought it was going way too far. To Zollner\u2026the enlightenment was definitely good thing for SOME things\u2026you know we have our secret society meetings\u2026this is a fun little game we're playing when it comes to a lot of things\u2026but when it comes to the institution of marriage\u2026now things are starting to get ridiculous, now you're starting to question the foundations of morality itself! Marriage is just way too important\u2026 to muddle it up with all these human created institutions\u2026it's best left in the hands of the church. He said you guys better just think about what you're doing here\u2026think about your actions before you \"confuse the hearts and minds of the people in the name of the enlightenment.\" After all, he asks right after that: what is enlightenment anyway? We have these Wednesday society meetings where we talk about the enlightenment\u2026but who ever decided what the end goal of enlightenment was? What IS enlightenment, because if it's gonna go THIS far then maybe I need a new definition! Maybe I need to start the Thursday society.\nWell it was one of those questions that was so obvious that no one had even thought to answer it yet. What IS enlightenment? We talk a lot on this podcast about the AGE of enlightenment\u2026and I know for a fact you guys at this point in the show the first thing you do whenever someone says a term is try to define terms\u2026I have no doubt at home listening to this podcast as I've been talking about the so called \"Age of enlightenment\" you guys have been asking yourself\u2026well what is enlightenment? By saying that, aren't we making a lot of assumptions ourselves? Look at you\u2026you're turning into philosophers!\nAnyway when Zollner posed this question\u2026it was like a circus\u2026EVERYONE wanted to respond\u2026dozens and dozens\u2026flocks of respected intellectuals gave their two cents but no one's response was more famous or more influential than a almost a year after he asked this question when an answer was given by none other than the man we've been talking about lately Mr. Immanuel Kant.\n\u00a0See Immanuel Kant had a very unique perspective in all this\u2026he's not just gonna sit back and let this little diversion tactic that Zollner does slide. No doubt this is a valid question Zollner brings to the table\u2026what is enlightenment\u2026but that could also be something else right? That could also be someone's primary argument having no merit, so they ask an unanswerable question to try to leave the conversation at a stalemate. That way they don't need to address the fact that their argument sucks.\u00a0\nLike if your girlfriend comes to you and says, John, John we've been together three months and I'm just not happy! OK, hold on there\u2026but answer me this: what is happiness? Can you answer me that? Because if you cant then I'm afraid we cant have his conversation!\u00a0\nNo, Kant's having none of that and he wastes no time and takes Zollner's question head on in the very first sentence of his response\u2026what is enlightenment? Kant says:\n\"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\"\u00a0\nWell what does he mean by that? It seems like he's saying\u2026and I don't want to come off like I'm putting words in Kant's mouth here\u2026but it seems to ME like he's saying that if you're an unenlightened person\u2026you are walking around your life constantly with a self-imposed state of immaturity. Why would he say that?\u00a0\nWell to understand fully where he's coming from, we need to understand some historical context\u2026we need to understand something about what it meant to be one of these people that would go to a place like the Wenesday society\u2026you know one of these people living in the 1700's that's FULLY AWARE that they're in the middle of a massive cultural movement that's going on.\u00a0\nNow to be one of these people\u2026a common question that you would ask to yourself\u2026or at least BE asked by other people at the time is: have we arrived at our destination? Have we done it? Are we now an enlightened people? I mean just look at what we've accomplished! Look at the scientific method we've created! Look at these new systems of government that we have! Look at the progress that's being made on a daily basis, comparable to the darkness we lived in for a thousand years during the middle ages. Let's just call a spade a spade\u2026we are enlightened now! We've earned the medals in the field of battle\u2026now let's wear them across our chests and walk around with pride!\nWell Kant realized something: people love to wear the medals\u2026 they don't love to earn the medals. See when Kant was asked this question\u2026Kant ALWAYS said that during his time they didn't live in an \"enlightened age\"\u2026no they lived in an \"Age of enlightenment\". We hadn't arrived at our destination yet\u2026but we were on the right path to get there.\u00a0\nJust think about that statement for a second though\u2026 it really begs the question of what we were as a species before we were in the age of enlightenment. It really almost seems like Kant saw human thought during his time in a state kind of like young adulthood\u2026they still had a ton of work to do a ton of lessons to learn..they weren't quite an adult yet\u2026but at least they weren't what they were before. A child. A passenger to whatever arbitrary superstitions and doctrines it decided to place value on.\nWhen you really think about it, and this is coming from me\u2026so this is not a term I use lightly: that's deep. I mean, this is why the first line of his response to reverend Zollner's question is: \"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\"\nSee, we all start out as children. We're born\u2026and as we're eating rocket ships full a baby food and we realize very quickly that the nature of life itself is very finite, right? I mean, at BEST we only have two parents. Two parents with a very limited set of experiences themselves\u2026most of the time the way they live their life\u2026they're really just doing the best they can\u2026 they're not trying to cure cancer\u2026they're just trying to make through another day at the factory without wanting to off themselves. As children, we don't have an infinite bookshelf spanning off into the horizon\u2026no, we have a limited number of books to read, cartoons to watch, church services to attend, relatives to consult. One things for sure, our childhood does not even consist of us as a five year old kid walking around the playground like Socrates\u2026some immensely educated, wise enlightened person, right? But it shouldn't be that way anyway.\nI mean, on the other hand that's one of the the great things about being a kid. You have nothing to worry about! You ask so many adults to recount the greatest days of their life and how often do they cite a time in their life when they had zero obligations? How often do adults tell their kids\u2026oh you think YOU got it bad as a kid\u2026wait till you have the stresses of adulthood, the bills, the commitments, the people you're beholden to, enjoy being a kid while you can!\"\u00a0\nNot to mention the fact that when you're a kid your life is pretty stress free because whenever you have a problem\u2026there is always a very clear solution of what the answer to the problem is. You have at your disposal essentially two omniscient oracles that you go to with ANY problem and they instantly have a solution\u2026their names are mom and dad. You get a boo boo on your foot\u2026you come to them, show them the problem\u2026they know exactly what to do about it. Someone's mean to you at school, you tell them about what they said\u2026they know exactly how to handle that situation next time. There's comfort in having that resource.\nYou know, on that same note, I've known people that have quit their job in the corporate world thinking that being their own boss would be their dream job, it'd be the best thing that could ever happen to them\u2026but when something goes wrong and there's a problem to be solved\u2026there's something comforting about not being the boss\u2026there's something that feels good about having someone to go to and ask what the best course of action is so that you're not the one making the decision that might potentially fail!\nWell, when we become adults\u2026bad stuff still might happen to you five minutes from now. You still may get a boo boo on your foot, except this time the boo boo on your foot may be that your house is getting foreclosed on\u2026or that your liver is shutting down. It's still terrifying to not know the future, so what do we do about it? How can we be sure that none of this bad stuff is gonna happen to us?\u00a0\nTo Kant, what we do as children is we outsource different components of our life. We need to by means of necessity. But we become dependent on this process. We become dependent on not thinking for ourselves. It feels good. It feels so good, Kant says, that we extend this way of doing business into adulthood. I mean think about it, there's no rite of passage between childhood and adulthood or some ceremony that takes place where we go from \"not capable of thinking for ourselves\" to \"capable of thinking for ourselves\". No we just live one continuous existence. So at what point do we make that decision to start thinking for ourselves and not just do the best imitation of our parents and the people around us as possible?\nWhen Kant says \"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\"\nWhat he's saying is that most people find so much comfort and ease in this lifestyle of outsourcing your thoughts on everything to the people around you during childhood that they just never stop doing it. They turn 18 and they find college professors to think for them. They turn 21 and they find charismatic radio personalities. They turn forty and they find hacky cable news commentators. They live their lives seeing themselves as autonomous adults, but just think of what they're doing here\u2026they're outsourcing their ENTIRE life to other people!\nKant says:\n\"It's so EASY to be immature. If I have a book to serve as my understanding, a pastor to serve as my conscience, a physician to determine my diet for me, and so on, I need not exert myself at all. I need not think, If only I can pay: others will readily undertake the irksome work for me.\"\nJust listen to the first line of that: it's so EASY to be immature, right? It's so easy to find a single book on a subject\u2026memorize a few taglines and insights from it and then whenever that topic comes up you just parrot whatever this author said and pass it off as your own thoughts. It's so easy to outsource your understanding.\nIt's so easy to go to church on Sunday, memorize a few taglines and insights from what a pastor told you is the correct way to act and then whenever you're faced with a moral dilemma or a choice to make about what the right decision is\u2026you just parrot whatever the pastor said and pass it off as your own decision. It's so easy to outsource your conscience.\nIt's so easy to find some nutrition guru. Find some website that tells you everything you're doing wrong with your diet\u2026they lay out exactly what you should eat and whenever someone asks you about what they should be eating you just parrot whatever the diet guru guy said on the internet. It's so easy to outsource every element of your life and allow someone else to think for you.\nKant says people claim to love this idea of freedom. They love this idea of truly being able to exercise their ability to choose\u2026to have a say in the matter. But how many of us just find someone else to outsource our thinking to and then wash our hands of the process of actually using our brains to think?\u00a0\nKant says people love to TALK about how much they love freedom\u2026but this immaturity\u2026this extension of their childhood\u2026this looking to others for our own thoughts is a cage that we lock ourselves in. It's a self-imposed cage. It's a cage where you never think for yourself, where you're constantly at the mercy of whatever people you arbitrarily decided to believe\u2026whatever book was next to you at Barnes and Noble\u2026whatever website came up on your search results \u2026whatever church was closest to your house. It's a self incurred cage of immaturity.\nNow, the good news is\u2026the key to that cage is hanging around your neck. The key out of this cage is around everyone's neck\u2026but they don't use it. And Kant says it's not a death sentence\u2026we don't stay in this state of self incurred immaturity because were somehow incapable of getting out of it. It's not that people are too stupid to get out of it. It's not a lack of understanding of HOW to get out of it\u2026but Kant says the reason why they don't is always one of two things\u2026the first one is that they're comfortable.\nRemember he said it in the first quote: it's so EASY to be immature. So what inevitably happens is people take the key from around their neck and they leave this cage for a few minutes and they can't handle it. Kant says\u2026they start thinking for themselves for the first time and it's incredibly uncomfortable\u2026they've never used this part of their brain before. It's like that scene out of the Matrix where Neo asks why do my eyes hurt? You've never used them before!\nKant says what happens is people usually just out of laziness retreat back to letting other people think for them because it's so much more difficult to think for yourself.\u00a0\n\"It is because of laziness and cowardice that so great a part of humankind, after nature has longsince emancipated them from other people\u2019s direction, \u00a0nevertheless gladly remains minors for It is so comfortable to be a minor!\u201d and \u201cHe has even grownfond of it.\"\nThe second reason Kant gives for why people keep themselves in this self-imposed cage of immaturity, as you probably picked up in that quote I just read\u2026 is cowardice. They lack the courage to ever stand up and use their intellect. Now at first glance this seems strange\u2026they lack the courage? Why would someone lack the courage to use their brain as much as they can? Why would it be scary to use your brain?\nWell think back to why we started this way of thinking in the first place\u2026because we were kids! When you're a kid\u2026it actually IS really scary to think for yourself. What if something bad happens\u2026I've never been here before\u2026I don't know anything! What Kant's saying is that that fear that you have doesn't just magically leave you the moment you throw your graduation hat up in the air.\u00a0\nThink about it\u2026it's scary to think for yourself! What if I'm wrong? What if that terrible thing happens to me that I'm always thinking about? What if I do this whole process of thinking for myself and then people reject me and call me an idiot! This is a big deal consider.\u00a0\nI mean, just because you read books and listen to podcasts doesn't mean you love to think about stuff\u2026you could just be reading books to have thoughts to recite when someone asks you a question. That's not you loving to think about stuff..that's fueled by insecurity! Oh my god, what if someone asks me a question and I don't have an answer to it!\u00a0\nBut Kant says we cant let this fear of failure or negative judgement enslave us for our entire lives. There's far too much at stake. Kant has some words for someone in this place trying to muster the courage to take the leap he says:\n\u201cthe danger is not in fact so great, for by a few falls they would eventually learn to walk; but an example of this kind makes them timid and usually frightens them away from any further attempt\u201d\nWhat Kant's saying is what if when you were a baby and you were trying to learn to walk you tried to stand up and fell over\u2026.you tried to stand up and fell over\u2026what if you just gave up? What you're gonna ride around on one of those hover-rounds the rest of your life? NO! That's ridiculous\u2026you keep trying until you learn the skills you need to walk! This is the same process as that\u2026REMOVE yourself from your self-incurred immaturity\u2026think for yourself\u2026fail..fail..fail again and eventually you will learn to walk.\u00a0\nHave the COURAGE to remove yourself from your self-incurred immaturity and not outsource your thinking to everyone around you. You know, Kant says this should be the trumpet that is sounded\u2026the motto and slogan of the enlightenment\u2026that we must DARE to be wise. To not cower in the corner terrified of what if we're wrong and we fall over a couple times\u2026no! We will fall over, we will learn our lessons but one thing we will not do is be willing\u2026to spend another thousand years outsourcing our thinking to whatever dogma arbitrarily lands on our lap.\u00a0\nNow if this all sounds abrasive and engaging to you, keep in mind that this was occasionally Kant's style. It's been said about Kant that he didn't teach people philosophy\u2026he taught them to philosophize. So, I hope you got some food for thought this week. That said, real briefly, the book I've been working on for about a year and a half is done now. I'll be releasing it within the next couple weeks\u2026I'm really proud of what it is\u2026I don't want to waste your time talking about it\u2026but I hope you'll consider checking it out\u2026I'll have more information the next time we meet. But until then\u2026thank you for listening\u2026I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_55": {"date": "2015-6-22", "text": "Posted on June 22, 2015\nEpisode 62 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #062 on Suicide Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid you know that it's illegal to commit suicide? Seriously!\nWell, it's been taken off the books in some places because they realized how\u2026just\u2026hilarious of a law that is. Nonetheless to this day\u2026and all throughout history\u2026it was a felony under English Common Law\u2026for most time periods and cultural climates it was ILLEGAL to commit suicide.\u00a0\nMight be spoiling the ending here but suicide's an interesting thing in morality. Is it okay\u2026is it not okay\u2026it's incredibly controversial\u2026certainly not a consensus on the matter. But given the time and place you were born into\u2026 you might think there was a clear cut answer.\u00a0\nLike what do we do when someone brings up suicide in normal, everyday conversation? Like what do you do if someone comes up to you at work and says in passing in a conversation\u2026my uncle committed suicide yesterday!\u00a0\nWell in modern American society you instantly feel terrible, oh no! He committed suicide, that's horrible! Quiet, reverential tone to your voice. Things get awkward real quick. Completely different response than if they said, I had to take my uncle to the airport yesterday, he's going on a long trip.\u00a0\nWell pardon me for asking this, I don't mean to offend anyone's longstanding beliefs on the nature of suicide, but after all this is a philosophy podcast in case you're new around here\u2026this is all about questioning our beliefs about stuff\u2026questioning why we think and act the way we do\u2026so I apologize in advance if this is an easy question for you to answer\u2026but why are we so quick to negatively judge suicide. Why are we so biased and judgmental toward suicide in particular? Why did suicide earn this reputation? Why can't it be that when someone tells you at work that their uncle committed suicide you say \"Hey! Good for him! That's Great!\"\nMaybe we should start here. Let me ask you something, can you at least imagine there ever being a situation where committing suicide is OK? Can you think of an example where committing suicide would be an OK thing to do?\nNow most people in response to this question fall into one of two camps I'm not saying you're either of these but most people would say either:\u00a0\nOne is: No! Are you kidding me? Why would you even ask that? Are you stupid? It's NEVER okay to kill yourself\u2026it's NEVER the right decision. There's always an alternative!\u00a0\nThe other is: Who cares? Not my problem? You want to kill yourself, kill yourself\u2026I can't stop you. It's your body. Do what you want with it!\nThe point I want to make here today is not which one of these is more correct, the question I want us to ask ourselves today is something kind of weird\u2026where do these beliefs come from in the first place? Your beliefs that you hold right now about whether suicide is morally permissible\u2026even if they're more nuanced than these two examples\u2026where did those beliefs come from initially? You weren't born with them\u2026you weren't a baby walking around with beliefs on suicide\u2026you must have learned them somewhere\u2026or reasoned to them somehow? Where do they come from?\nHere's an even better question: can you imagine a world\u2026and this is COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL HERE\u2026I REALIZE HOW CRAZY THIS SOUNDS\u2026but can you imagine a world where committing suicide was actually considered a good thing? Where people waited their entire lives for their ultimate moment to commit suicide\u2026where they trained every day in hopes of one day having the deterministic laws of the universe or the providential hand of God or whatever they believed in\u2026GIVE THEM THE GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY to commit suicide? Can you imagine a world where you tell someone that your uncle committed suicide at work and you were met with smiles? Because if you can, then you can imagine the world you actually live in\u2026and that's a good place to start.\nThe Spartans lived every day training, PRAYING for this sort of opportunity\u2026to be met with a glorious situation of certain death on the battlefield where they may sacrifice themselves. Even in many cultures today it's seen as an honorable thing to do, to take your own life if you're nothing but a financial or emotional burden on your family.\u00a0\nSee, what I'm arguing is not that suicide is some great thing\u2026but that the world is not as black and white as suicide is bad in every situation or suicide is perfectly okay in every situation\u2026even just in the vacuum of modern America\u2026a single culture\u2026a single time period\u2026. even then we keep two sets of books when it comes to suicide.\u00a0\nHitler\u2026notoriously seen as a suicide. The guy had it coming. The enemies were converging on Berlin and he killed himself. But what about Jesus? Ah! That's not a suicide\u2026he was put to death by the Romans! I got news for you people\u2026Jesus was God manifest on planet earth\u2026this guy could walk on water\u2026he could heal the blind. He could've summoned an army of freakin' unicorns to come down and kill the Romans but he chose not to. He facilitated his own death\u2026he committed suicide in the name of your sins! It's very tempting to try to redefine these things so that we can reserve the word suicide for times when we facilitated our own death and I don't agree with it!\u00a0\nFor you more secular minded folks out there what about the suicide of Socrates in the name of philosophy? You're probably thinking, no! he was sentenced to death by the Athenians! But Socrates could've EASILY argued his way out of those charges\u2026he chose not to! He wasn't going to be reduced to sophistry! He committed suicide in the name of a noble cause! Again, it's very tempting to try to redefine these things so that we can reserve the word suicide for times when we facilitated our own death and I don't agree with it!\u00a0\n\nWhen someone tells us at work that their uncle committed suicide over the weekend\u2026we INSTANTLY assume that something must have been wrong with them when they made that decision. And there may have been mentally, but that doesn't change our assumptions that we make: Why would anyone commit suicide? I certainly wouldn't commit suicide! Death is something I'm trying to avoid at all costs! But therein lies the problem: you're conflating your own intentions behind why you make the choices you do with theirs..and it's all from the comfort of that armchair up in your head.\u00a0\nHere's what I'm going to ask you to consider today: that maybe your thoughts on suicide are equally as conditioned into your head as the ones were into the heads of the Spartans during antiquity. Maybe your beliefs on suicide are more pliant or less black and white than they seem on the surface.\nWe're going to look at suicide from a lot of different angles today\u2026ultimately to Kant's views which I think are an incredibly interesting take on why suicide is NEVER okay\u2026but let this episode serve as an extension of last episode. Let this episode be an example of how easy it is to outsource our beliefs to the people around us\u2026I mean, suicide doesn't seem very dynamic. It seems like something cut and dry enough\u2026if conclusions about what is morally permissible are possible at all\u2026.suicide seems like one of those things where we'd be able to conclude some stuff on. Right?\u00a0\nNow I know what you're saying right now: well look when someone at work tells me their uncle killed themselves I instantly assume somethings wrong with them because usually there was and I have a reverential tone in my voice because mental illness is a tragedy. I wholeheartedly agree. Mentally ill and depressed people do kill themselves. These people needed help that they didn't get\u2026in fact if you want my opinion I think in 100 years people will look at how little we serve these people as a society and think we were barbarians. People also typically make an exception for suicide when it comes to the terminally ill\u2026if someone's in a lot of pain\u2026they think it's okay for them to go out on their own terms\u2026again, not disagreeing.\nBut that said, I would ask you to return to the original question: barring the exceptions of mentally or terminally ill people taking their own life, is suicide morally permissible to you? How much control do people have over their own bodies? Does an otherwise mentally sound, perfectly normal person have the right to take their own life? Would you say they were morally wrong for doing it? These are questions worth asking\u2026and the mental illness exception to the rule is one that Plato recognized all the way back in the third century BC.\u00a0\nPlato writes in his work Phaedo through the quintessentially wise character of Socrates aligning himself with something the Pythagoreans initially talked about\u2026in one of Plato's more Pythagorean moments\u2026he says that suicide is definitely wrong. It's wrong because it would be releasing ourselves from our duty that the gods put us here to do. He compares us like a guard at a guard post\u2026it would be in appropriate if you were a guard manning a post to relieve yourself of your duty\u2026no it's not YOUR choice when to leave your guard post\u2026no you wait for your orders. Plato talks about how we've been placed here as sort of a punishment by the Gods\u2026we're kind of like prisoners serving a sentence, although there's a pretty negative connotation you would attach to being a prisoner so its probably not the best example\u2026but us committing suicide is wrong because its like we're a prisoner committing some sort of celestial jailbreak to Plato. It's not our job to decide when our sentence is over.\u00a0\nPlato does give exceptions to this rule\u2026people who are struggling with mental illness and people whose character is so far gone it's a lost cause\u2026these people get a free pass\u2026but for everyone else\u2026there is no excuse for committing suicide\u2026it would be laziness or cowardice to relieve yourself of your duty\u2026Plato even starts to sound emasculating at times like\u2026what you can't handle the pressures of life? Man up ya sissy!\nSo, I wanna talk about this theory\u2026the idea that it would be morally wrong to relieve ourselves of our duty as guards placed at a guard post by the gods for a purpose. Now it's easy to look back and cloud this theory with medieval superstition, it's easy to say oh Plato with his hocus pocus about gods and goblins and witches\u2026but keep in mind\u2026Plato lived centuries before Jesus made it popular to be a monotheist. Plato's not talking about a singular God that has a personal relationship with you who has decreed a moral code for you to follow\u2026and I think it opens up a lot of interesting conversations to be charitable to Plato here. Like, you can apply any number of different viewpoints across Plato's example and you might be able to appreciate his argument more.\nLike, let's do a modern example\u2026let's apply some Saganism to Plato. Carl Sagan's famous quote we are a way for the cosmos to know itself. We are sentient life. We sense and perceive the world around us. Our purpose is to sense and perceive the world around us. So if you apply this idea across Plato's example metaphorically, the gods could just be the ordering principles of the universe\u2026you know the laws of physics, the laws of thermodynamics, the progressive adaptation of life to acclimate to its environment\u2026the things that make it possible for sentient life to exist\u2026and our guard post that we're manning as guards\u2026is just\u2026to perceive the world around us. The universe has bestowed upon you sentient life\u2026the incredible ability to be one tiny aspect of that totality and be a way for the cosmos to know itself. It has bestowed upon you a guard post and you committing suicide would be to cut that perceiving short\u2026that duty that you have to help the cosmos know itself.\u00a0\nNow again, this works with any number of examples, the constant in the argument is this: we have an obligation to some exterior thing\u2026some purpose assigned to us by a third party that would make us killing ourselves immoral because it is us not meeting up to our end of the bargain. People do this with government and society. They say\u2026from the very moment you're born society and government are affording you a certain lifestyle\u2026security, resources, even down to the roads\u2026these things are serving you\u2026and some people say that suicide is wrong because you owe it BACK to this society your production for as long as you possibly can. Again, from Gods, to virtue to society\u2026the constant here is that it is wrong for you to kill yourself because you have an obligation to meet your end of some bargain that's been set up, often times without your explicit consent\u2026which starts to be the REALLY twisted and funny part about this.\nBut anyway you have the Stoics\u2026Seneca\u2026council to the emperor Nero as we talked about\u2026one of the most famous suicides ever\u2026it's the quality of life that matters not the quantity of life.\u00a0\nBut nothing was more influential on how the average modern American views suicide than Christianity. Now it should be said, in recent years, the Catholic church has been coming around\u2026they see the writing on the wall\u2026if they want to survive as being a moral authority in the world\u2026 they're going to have to lighten up in relation to the society that's growing morally around them\u2026they've introduced new clauses that allow for mentally and terminally ill people to commit suicide and they're pretty sure Jesus is going to take that terrible disease he allowed them to get into consideration before damning them to hell-fire, but before about 15 years ago, the stance of Christianity on suicide was based on a conglomeration of the philosophy of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.\u00a0\nSuicide was wrong. Absolutely wrong. No exceptions. Turns out God takes the ten commandments pretty seriously\u2026and what Augustine notices about suicide\u2026he writes in his famous work The City of God is that God makes his stance on suicide very clear. He says \"Thou shalt not kill\". Now, he also says Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\u00a0\nSo what Augustine says is: God very deliberately frames it this way. He could've easily chiseled into some stone tablets Thou shall not kill thy neighbor, but NO! He says thou shall not kill! That means EVERYTHING! Yourself included, future reader of this stone tablet. Makes it kind of interesting and confusing when you think about all the life coursing through the animals we supposedly have dominion over\u2026and the fact that all of Christianity is contingent on a voluntary human sacrifice..but either way: God's will was clear. Suicide was wrong\u2026no matter what color you were\u2026.Black, white or yellow with jaundice.\u00a0\nThomas Aquinas completely agreed with Augustine. He defends the idea further throughout his philosophy and ultimately the end game of their philosophical suicide tag team is an idea that we, as mere humans, we didn't COMPLETELY\u2026own\u2026our bodies\u2026we were limited to what they called usus..sorta like a rent to own program. We're merely in possession of these bodies\u2026God owns them\u2026we renting them as we're navigating this planet\u2026but the deed is in his name. Now, the natural conclusion here is that if you commit suicide in the middle ages your body was desecrated, torn apart, mutilated\u2026and all of your possessions and your family's possessions were seized. Wait, was that the natural conclusion\u2026either way: it's how it went down. They didn't take suicide lightly in the Middle Ages, they just loved you way too much to watch you hurt yourself.\u00a0\nNow this moral absolutist stance on suicide was the main way of thinking all the way until the enlightenment\u2026it was unshakable. It was powerful. Consider this: even someone like a John Locke\u2026even someone whose entire political philosophy\u2026world changing political philosophy is predicated on the idea that we talked about on here: we as humans have the right to life, liberty and property\u2026liberty over our body and what it produces\u2026even John Locke says that one of the exceptions to that rule of liberty over our body is that\u2026well, we can't kill ourselves.\nWhy would he make that distinction? Why don't we have sovereignty over our body to the point we can destroy it if we want? Raises a lot of interesting questions about what suicide even is. Like couldn't you make the case that people that smoke or people that eat really bad or people that drink all the time, they're willingly destroying their body\u2026but you wouldn't call that suicide. You wouldn't call it suicide if someone thought they were drinking Kool-aid but instead they were drinking bleach. So suicide can't be just any death that you cause yourself\u2026what philosophers usually say from here is that suicide is when you INTENTIONALLY are bringing about death on yourself. It's somewhere in the intentions behind WHY you're doing something that suicide lies\u2026not in what actually happens. Conversely, it's still suicidal behavior if you think you're taking an entire bottle of prescription meds when in reality they were Flintstones vitamins.\u00a0\nBut questions about what suicide is aside: philosophy's opinion on it took a giant shift in the enlightenment thinkers that we've been talking about for the last dozen or so episodes. Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume\u2026they all opposed the, as they saw it, radical idea that suicide is morally impermissible. Hume may be the most interesting of all these positions\u2026mostly just because what he does is SO DAVID HUME. It's exactly what you'd expect from David Hume.\nHe takes the argument that the church has been making for centuries about why suicide is wrong and he points out all the assumptions and contradictions in it and ultimately shows that it may be more complicated than they're leading on about.\u00a0\nSo their argument is that we don't own our bodies and that ultimately it's God's decision when and how we die and that by killing ourselves we are going against the \"divine order\" that god has set up for the universe. Again, we are beholden to some \"divine order\" that God has established\u2026to take your own life is to violate that order.\u00a0\nSo Hume just starts there. What is this divine order that we're appealing to? Really let's get to the bottom of what this divine order is that we're beholden to\u2026by divine order do you just mean the causal laws created by God? What he's saying is\u2026are we never allowed to take any action for the sake of our own happiness for fear of going against this divine order? Well, obviously that's ridiculous\u2026God wouldn't get mad at you for taking medication when you're sick or trying to get yourself better if you were dying. That can't be the divine order that we're talking about.\u00a0\nIf the divine order is just a set of behaviors that is intended to make us happy\u2026then what if someone decides they'd be happier if they killed themselves? That wouldn't contradict the divine order if that's what it is.\u00a0\nIs the divine order just whatever God consents to? Because in that case then God seems to be consenting to everything that we're doing. I mean after all, Hume says\u2026an omnipotent God could always choose to intervene and change the course of history\u2026he apparently does all the time\u2026so at least we know we're not going against the divine order if THAT is the metric you're using.\u00a0\nBut what about society Hume? Maybe not God, but don't we have a moral obligation to stick around for society? Don't we owe it to our fellow countrymen to give and produce as much as we can for as long as we can given that we so willingly accepted the benefits of society for so long? Hume says that's all well and good, but it reaches a limit right? Eventually you get to be 60 years old, sometimes much younger, and it just becomes extremely painful to work. Should that person continue working in abject suffering\u2026working themselves into the ground just for the sake of this obligation they have to society? You would have to call them an immoral person if they didn't!\u00a0\nOkay, Hume. I see what you're saying\u2026but we can't actually live this way right? I mean, what's to stop the whole world from just killing themselves if we don't tell them it's unthinkably wrong? That's the slippery slope argument\u2026I guess if I was Bill O'reilly I would feel like I really just made a good point\u2026but the more sound argument from someone might be: I mean people that are young and stupid make rash, immoral decisions all the time. How many teenagers have stolen a candy bar from a 7/11\u2026what if they make a similar rash, immoral decision but this time it isn't a snickers bar at stake\u2026it's their life at stake!\nTo that, Hume would say\u2026what are we really worried about if we DARE TO SAY that suicide is a morally permissible thing? Look it's not like we are EVER going to go around being attracted to the idea of suicide. We have a natural aversion to death as humans\u2026and what he says is that if a right thinking person ever got to a place where they just didn't want to live anymore, they got to that place and arrived at that mental conclusion in the face of that fear of death, in SPITE of that fear of death. They probably thought long and hard about the decision to even be able to transcend that natural wiring. Hume would say\u2026this isn't something comparable to stealing a candy bar at 7/11. Suicide takes courage to Hume. Suicide takes clarity of mind for someone to do, obviously with the exceptions we've already talked about.\u00a0\nVoltaire also talks about this inherent fear of death as being a safeguard against people just randomly killing themselves one night\u2026oops! He has a really beautiful quote:\u00a0\n\u201cI have been a hundred times on the point of killing myself, but still was fond of life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our worst instincts. What can be more absurd than choosing to carry a burden that one really wants to throw to the ground? To detest, and yet to strive to preserve our existence? To caress the serpent that devours us, and hug him close to our bosoms till he has gnawed into our hearts?\u201d \u00a0\nHe's saying how crazy is it that even in cases where people hate their life and I mean truly hate it\u2026detest their very existence\u2026they STILL have a desire to live. They STILL have that instinct to just persist\u2026at all costs. It's downright illogical, Voltaire's saying\u2026it's like caressing the serpent that is eating us. Why would we go on like that? To take it one step further: why would we say that someone is immoral for wanting to end that? Why don't they have full control over what they do with their body?\nLet me ask you this question: if you knew someone who said that they truly hated their life and what they wanted more than anything else in this entire world\u2026what would make them happy is to end it all\u2026let's say you knew they were planning to do it on a specific night\u2026would you want some sort of police force or governing body to step in and stop them from doing it? To restrain them? Do you believe that people not only have the right to take their own life if they so choose to\u2026but they also have the right to not have people intervene and STOP them from doing it if they want to?\u00a0\nThere are a lot of people that feel this way. If what you want more than anything else is to kill yourself\u2026these people say I don't think it's right for someone to be able to tie you up and force you to live. But the flip side is true as well\u2026if you don't think someone should be able to intervene and STOP someone from committing suicide, then you need to be consistent and also not believe in doctors being able to intervene and ASSIST people with the act of committing suicide. Complicated national debate we've been having in this country for quite a while and I think this question of whether we should allow people to intervene on either side of the decision is one of the big things that stops progress\u2026it's a tough question to answer.\u00a0\nThe point I think these enlightenment thinkers would want us to realize is that it's so easy for us to relegate this activity down into terms of: I think death is bad. Therefore, suicide must also be bad. But many cultures don't see it this way at all\u2026sometimes the most dignified and best way you can die is on your own terms\u2026maybe what you have a problem with is not the act of suicide itself as someone voluntarily facilitating their own death, but something else that lies at the root of the intentions behind suicide. Because not everyone commits suicide for the same reasons\u2026some do it out of depression\u2026some do it out of anger like I'm gonna really show you and commit suicide! like they're punishing someone, but other people do it in the name of glory. Other's do it out of a duty to their family and people around them. Others do it because they believe they are serving the creator of the universe\u2026sacrificing themselves in the name of the very thing that they believe gave them life in the first place.\u00a0\nWell, Kant didn't see room for this sort of nuance. No, Kant thought it was very simple. Suicide is wrong. But what's interesting about Kant is that in part of his argument he gives an entirely SECULAR account of why suicide is always wrong. This separates him from many of the others that are appealing to what a God chiseled into stone on the top of a mountain several thousand years ago.\u00a0\nKant thinks that if you even try to commit suicide\u2026not even succeed at it\u2026but even just TRYING to commit suicide is tantamount to \"discarding your humanity\". You are now lower than the beasts to Kant. Lower than animals. He's not just throwing around a bunch of insults here cause he's having a bad day\u2026No Kant REALLY thinks that if you try to commit suicide and survive\u2026that we can treat you like an animal now. Like who's a good boy? Who's the best boy in the world? Kant says we should \"treat him as a beast, as a thing, and to use him for our sport as we do a horse or a dog.\"\nNow where is Kant coming from here? Well, Kant says that by killing yourself, you're no longer treating yourself as a human being, but more of as a thing\u2026nothing more\u2026which to Kant has a lower status and apparently gets fed dog biscuits and used for sport:\n\u201cMan can only dispose of things; beasts are things in this sense; but man is not a thing, not a beast. If he disposes of himself, he treats his value as that of a beast. He who so behaves, who has no respect for human behavior, makes a thing of himself.\u201d\nThe other argument Kant gives I think is the REALLY interesting one and that is that: it just doesn't make sense that something could be a moral act\u2026where the very act of doing it precludes moral acts from being able to take place at all.\u00a0\nIn other words, if you kill yourself, you're dead. That's it. You can't do moral things anymore. What Kant is saying is why would it be moral to \"root out the existence of morality in the world.\" Why does that make sense? That something could be considered moral than prevents you from doing anything moral. By taking your own life you are robbing yourself of your rationality\u2026of your ability to do your moral duty\u2026you are robbing yourself of everything that distinguishes you as a human that makes free-thinking choices. This is the reason why Kant thinks it's not only morally WRONG to commit suicide, but by even trying to do so, you forfeit your human card.\u00a0\nYou know, this whole conversation we're having\u2026that we've been having over the Kant and Hume episodes is coming to a climax. This whole conversation is a micro to a larger macro that is going on in history\u2026what Kant and Hume are doing here whether they realized it at the time or not is craft a way of looking at human life that is so beautiful and so freeing of the shackles of this burden that we willingly place on ourselves to KNOW so much all the time\u2026.\nYou know what\u2026I'll save that. The point of this episode is don't commit suicide. Thank you for listening, I'll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_56": {"date": "2015-6-30", "text": "Posted on June 30, 2015\nEpisode 63 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of Episode 63 \u2013 Kant pt. 8 \u2013 Limitations of Knowledge.\u00a0Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nI wanna start the episode today by simultaneously saying both the most controversial and least controversial thing I\u2019ve ever said on this show. You are not built to have total knowledge of everything around you. I\u2019m sorry. No matter how painful or unpainful this is for you to hear, you just were not designed to arrive at a full understanding of everything that exists out there. > There\u2019s this weird tightrope that we walk as human beings sometimes\u2026on one hand we live our lives and we want to feel like everything is knowable\u2026we want to feel like if we just keep philosophizing and conducting science experiments that eventually we\u2019ll get to some knowledge rest stop along the highway\u2026to a place where we just know\u2026everything. Or at least close to everything. But on the other hand\u2026at some level\u2026we know this is impossible. On the other hand we know just how incapable we are of knowing. > Many people simply by virtue of being the kind of person that listens to a podcast like this\u2026there\u2019s a part of you that sees value in seeking knowledge, right? Understandable. I\u2019m one of you. > But why do you do it? Why seek knowledge about the world as opposed to not seeking knowledge? You ever had someone ask you that? Why do you like to LEARN stuff\u2026do you know what I like\u2026NOT reading. That\u2019s my thing. Why would you ever read a book about something when you can just enjoy your life instead? Why would you ever watch a documentary on something and actively use your brain when you can be entertained\u2026 watching Honey boo boo? It\u2019s a valid question: why are you listening to this podcast when you could be listening to one of any number of hacky ex stand up comedians telling the same formulaic dick jokes week after week into a microphone? > How would you respond if someone asked you that? Well I would respond by saying that no matter how immediately ungratifying an educational experience may seem on the surface\u2026it usually leads to my life being better in some way, right? Knowledge is power. I learn new things and I create for myself a richer, fuller understanding of the universe. I can list off a thousand examples of how learning things makes me less ailed by ignorance\u2026 or clouded by superstition like some member of a pygmy tribe. > Knowledge brings opportunities that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have..by that I mean that more opportunities present themselves to you in this world because of this knowledge that you have.You can look around at the world and appreciate things more than other people\u2026in this way knowledge broadens our vision of what the universe is\u2026it makes everything in this small very limited, community that you live in\u2026bigger\u2026more exciting\u2026more interesting. > For example\u2026let\u2019s say you watch a Netflix documentary on\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026electrical boxes. When you\u2019re walking down the street\u2026you look at that electrical box\u2026you don\u2019t just see an electrical box\u2026you see all the ingenuity behind it\u2026how it powers the entire neighborhood\u2026you think about how George C. Electric Box in 1843 made the first one and you consider the intricate web of wires and connectors\u2026the billions of calculations that box is making every day\u2026when you apply your knowledge to your perception of the world around you\u2026you are for all intents and purposes seeing a completely different world than someone else who walks past that very same electrical box and just says. Meh. This things in my way. Knowledge makes the universe bigger and more interesting. > And lucky for people like us\u2026knowledge is a respectable paradigm to strive for in our society. I think it\u2019s so respectable\u2026many of us choose it and fall into the trap of failing to ask ourselves: what is my ultimate goal here? What\u2019s the endgame? What am I aiming towards with knowledge? What are we as a species aiming towards? Total knowledge of everything there is? Sure, why not? I mean why would we ever get to a stopping point? Can you really ever imagine scientists stopping? We could arrive at the most awesome piece of knowledge imaginable and would we really stop? Why would we? There\u2019s no stopping point when it comes to knowledge! > Or is there? > You know there\u2019s a way of thinking about our knowledge of the universe that seems pretty popular when I talk to people in today\u2019s world but it was actually being talked about all the way back in Kant\u2019s time\u2026there was a famous mathematician named Pierre Laplace who was sort of the poster child for this way of thinking\u2026the idea was that if we knew the location\u2026theoretically speaking\u2026if we knew the location of every atom in the entire universe\u2026and we knew exactly how to calculate these seemingly necessary, constant forces like gravity\u2026that we could at least in theory simulate every cosmic event\u2026every natural event\u2026we could simulate or predict EVERYTHING that was going to happen\u2026from there on out. > Now in modern times this usually takes more of the form of\u2026look at what science has done so far! Look at how much we know compared to before! As long as these people in lab coats keep conducting these empirical experiments and concluding things and then building off of those experiments and making further conclusions that eventually\u2026we will have arrived at TRUTH\u2026we will have knowledge of everything there is in the entire universe! > There\u2019s a huge difference between truth and knowledge. What Immanuel Kant would want us to consider\u2026and this is a very key distinction to make\u2026 is that even if we arrived at this rest stop on the knowledge highway\u2026even if this was possible, at best all we could EVER have is not total knowledge of everything there is\u2026but total knowledge of human experience. There\u2019s a big difference between the two. > Remember Kant talks about how there are two worlds\u2026the world of things in themselves\u2026the noumenal world\u2026out there somewhere\u2026out of our reach\u2026and the world of appearances\u2026that\u2019s the world we live in\u2026the crude map of that more real world that our mind and senses produce so that we can navigate our existence. > We know this\u2026we know at some level that everything we see all around us is not TRUE, fundamental reality\u2026but only what our mind is depicting of that reality\u2026yet just at a raw everyday existence level\u2026very few of us make that distinction\u2026we live our lives as though we are existing in some infallible, true depiction of the universe. It\u2019s almost like a defense mechanism. > This is why I said this is simultaneously the most and least controversial thing I\u2019ve ever said on this show\u2026people navigate their lives emphatically believing they are making judgments in the \u201creal world\u201d but they\u2019re never more than a couple well placed questions away from being talked down from that standpoint\u2026from saying\u2026ah yes well of course this isn\u2019t reality! > Like if you believe you are an agent of the Christian God\u2019s will navigating this planet, then you don\u2019t believe that God created your eyes, ears and mental faculties to necessarily comprehend the FULL extent of this majestic, glorious tabernacle he\u2019s created for you\u2026no he made you so your eyes and ears would work well enough\u2026well enough to read the bible and treat other people around you nicely. > If you\u2019re a Godless, hedonistic monster, well you also have another way you look at the world. This hardware that you have to perceive the world is not necessarily designed to measure the fabric of reality itself\u2026it\u2019s designed to pick bananas and live in these particular climatological conditions. And in that way, the hardware you have that is picking up this reality is completely arbitrary on a cosmic level right? This way that you perceive the world is really only a relevant skill-set on this little blue planet that we have during this very short time period, right? > Let me explain what I mean by this: right now you can see certain types of waves. You can see light waves, heat waves, etc\u2026but you can\u2019t see other ones\u2026like gamma rays, microwaves radio waves\u2026but they still exist right? Just because you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t exist, but how did we get to a place where we needed these special instruments to see some waves but not others? Well again, if you\u2019re a Godless hatchet man of Satan then you probably believe that life forms with genetic mutations that could perceive things like light and heat waves had a reproductive advantage in some former world and that being able to see things like gamma rays or radio waves isn\u2019t impossible\u2026it just wasn\u2019t that useful before the advent of the radio. > Let\u2019s use a modern example. Let\u2019s imagine some really bizarre post-apocalyptic scenario where there are disparate pockets of wi-fi signal still being transmitted and we have these devices that we carry around that pick up that wi-fi signal and it connects us to a network where we\u2019re told where to find fresh water and food. Now if that\u2019s the world you live in most of you listening to this show have a serious problem on your hands\u2026you don\u2019t see wi-fi signal flying around when you walk into Starbucks, right? If you do you should probably get that checked out\u2026you don\u2019t SEE the wifi signal, but it\u2019s still there. All around you. Because of that\u2026your life in this post apocalyptic world would be VERY difficult\u2026you\u2019d be reduced to walking around randomly staring at your phone praying for bars to show up. You\u2019d be hopeless. > Now here\u2019s the crazy thing\u2026there probably are several people alive today that can sense when wifi signal is present. Either by seeing it or feeling it or hearing it\u2026but either way\u2026that skill that person has that right now is practically useless\u2026becomes very relevant in this bizarre post apocalyptic world that we\u2019re talking about. You essentially become a human dousing rod. I mean, talk about a survival advantage. You can sense where the disparate wifi connections are that lead to food and water! I want that guy on my team. > My point is: this guy goes on to reproduce and his kids inherit this gene\u2026their kids inherit the gene and so on\u2026this goes on enough generations and it\u2019s not crazy to think that the average human being eventually could be able to actually see wifi signals. Right? Now, my BIGGER point is that the fact you CAN\u2019T see wifi signals and can see light rays\u2026is equally as arbitrary. It\u2019s determined by whatever climatological conditions your ancestors were in. If survival was contingent on some OTHER skill set in the past\u2026you wouldn\u2019t be here and if we want to pretend we would be here then it\u2019s not contrary to reason to say that the map our mind creates of reality\u2026our experience of the world might be much different than it is now. > See what we are to Kant\u2026this is very important for us to understand\u2026is not a perceiver of the world of things in themselves\u2026the ACTUAL world\u2026no we should think of ourselves as an experience machine. A human apparatus that walks around experiencing stuff. That mind that you have that draws you a picture of reality\u2026it\u2019s not necessarily showing you the world as it TRULY is\u2026but just the information that\u2019s USEFUL to you. And that, as we just talked about could be any number of things\u2026 it could be God giving you eyes good that are just good enough to find the collection plate or your eyes just being good enough to get by on this very subjective, circumstantial, narrow set of climate conditions. > But think of what that means: if that is true\u2026then human experience itself might be very subjective, circumstantial and narrow. What you\u2019re seeing right now could be nothing compared to what there actually is. There could be an infinity of parallel universes stacked on top of you right now that you have no idea are even there because it serves you no purpose to see them, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there\u2026no it just means God\u2019s love is not limited to one universe and why would he show you them if you\u2019re being morally judged in this one. There could be an infinite number of waves or vibrations or signals going all around you all the time that you don\u2019t sense\u2026we don\u2019t have an instrument that READS these signals\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there\u2026just that 100 million years ago it didn\u2019t give some mutated fish with a gimp leg a reproductive advantage to perceive them. > Now here\u2019s Kant\u2019s point: Kant loves the sciences. He thought Newton was definitely headed in the right direction when it comes to arriving at knowledge about this seemingly mechanistic universe that we live in, but what Kant would say is\u2026what science is really good at doing is arriving at knowledge about HUMAN EXPERIENCE\u2026not things as they are in themselves necessarily. Now that doesn\u2019t make ANY PART of the scientific body of knowledge not useful in Kant\u2019s eyes but it does make a very good point about human knowledge itself\u2026that what we know\u2026what we\u2019re organizing when we do science is only human experience\u2026 and that any inference we make about what that actual world looks like to Kant, is useless. What it also does is make the point that given how obviously flawed and narrow this human experience machine that we have at our disposal is\u2026it begs another question: are there at least potentially things that we just CAN\u2019T know? Knowing anything is always contingent on that human apparatus, right? So are there things out there\u2026 that ours are just not capable of knowing or perceiving regardless of how big of a microscope we make or how much philosophy we do? Both metaphorically and literally speaking: Are there signals out there that we just can\u2019t pick up simply because of the human apparatus we fell into by happenstance? > Kant thinks the answer is yes and he also thinks that dismissing things about what the world is based on this very narrow conception of reality that you have is just plain dumb. > Kant believed in God. Kant was not just a believer in God\u2026but a believer in human souls\u2026he believed that we actually have free will despite how that might seem contrary to the Newtonian Universe that was emerging\u2026he believed all this stuff. > Now at first glance this may seem weird or inconsistent. In fact, it may seem inconsistent at second or third glance as well. In fact, you eventually get to a point where you just stop glancing at Kant and start glancing at the people that came after him\u2026but there are some interesting discussions to be had in the mean time. > Kant\u2019s views on God would be very confusing to someone just getting into philosophy. Like does he like God or doesn\u2019t he? Because back there he was saying some really mean stuff about God but then I heard him say something about faith and God existing\u2026which seems like its different! I don\u2019t know! > Keep in mind\u2026before you label Kant as a superstitious moron\u2026that this is the same unparalleled genius Kant that we referenced back in our episode on St. Anselm. This is the same Kant to finally debunk Anselms proof of God\u2019s existence. You know, if God exists then he must be the greatest possible thing that can exist. God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived. I can imagine that thing in my head. Couple that with the fact that something actually existing has to be at least marginally greater than something not existing\u2026therefore, the TRUE thing than which nothing greater can be conceived must exist. Therefore, God exists. > Now if you\u2019re rolling your eyes right now\u2026this was a knockdown argument in philosophy before Kant. Consider the fact that Kant went OUT OF HIS WAY during his lifetime to debunk this thing. In fact, Kant goes out of his way to debunk a lot of stuff about how people have been thinking of God. Remember, Kant agrees with Hume in his rebuttal to the Cosmological argument or the prime mover argument that we are assuming that the universe needed to have a cause. Kant says sure, when navigating the world as one of these human experience machines it intuitively makes sense that this all needed a cause, but we can\u2019t say anything about things in themselves\u2026which is what this all truly is. Cause and effect\u2026space and time\u2026these are ways that our minds make sense of the world\u2026we know nothing about what things are like in themselves\u2026just the human experience of these things. So all these arguments that use these intuitive approaches to what \u201cHAS TO BE TRUE\u201d because \u201cIT JUST DOESN\u2019T MAKE SENSE OTHERWISE\u201d are nonsense to Kant. > Kant makes all these arguments and still believes in God. He still believes in human souls. He still believes in free will\u2026and if you asked him about it\u2026he wouldn\u2019t do what anselm did or Descartes did or Thomas Aquinas or any of these people that try to persuade you into thinking that God exists\u2026you know give you an argument for how we \u201cknow\u201d God exists. > Kant takes it another direction. He thinks these things were talking about here\u2026god, free will, souls\u2026these are beyond our capacity to know. If you asked Kant do you \u201cknow\u201d if God exists? Or do you \u201cknow\u201d that humans have free will? He would laugh and say of course not. Of course I don\u2019t KNOW whether God exists or any of these things\u2026but these things are by their very nature outside of what is possible for us to know with this very narrow, limited apparatus that we have to navigate the world. > Now you might be saying, Ok Kant but it seems like you\u2019re sidestepping the issue here. It seems like you\u2019re creating this alternative world that we can\u2019t know anything about\u2026and I\u2019m fully on board with that\u2026I\u2019m fully on board with the idea that we shouldn\u2019t be making assumptions about it or even speaking about the world of things in themselves because to do so would be using human language, words and phrases that we use to describe our human experience and even THAT is assuming too much about this world of things in themselves\u2026I\u2019m on board with all that\u2026but it seems like\u2026you\u2026are now assuming quite a bit about this real world\u2026like the fact that a God is a part of it. > But there\u2019s us walking that tightrope that I talked about at the beginning of the episode. We want to believe that if a God existed\u2026we want to believe that come on\u2026we\u2019d at least be able to know that it exists, right? We want to believe that that\u2019s a piece of knowledge our mind could arrive at. But what if it\u2019s not? We know at some level\u2026Isn\u2019t it possible that it\u2019s not? > What if to some other creature\u2026 looking at the world through a different apparatus than our human one it is perfectly obvious that a God exists or that humans have souls or any number of things? What if the existence of a God is as unknowable to us as the existence of some type of ray or particle or some parallel universe that we just don\u2019t have the ability to ever sense no matter how big of a microscope we build? > When you look at the world like Kant does\u2026really makes the God of the Abrahamic religions start to seem pretty sadistic if you think about it. I mean to make part of the criterion of whether you get into heaven or not a belief in whether he exists\u2026but then to give you hardware that makes it impossible for you to ever know. It\u2019s like the entire meaning of your life is to believe in something based on nothing. Like why doesn\u2019t God have a YouTube channel? I mean seriously people\u2026weekly addresses\u2026no more ambiguity\u2026special segment\u2026here\u2019s what I meant when I said that thing\u2026that thing that you\u2019ve interpreted to mean twelve different things. > Kant has a lot of slippery arguments about why he believes in all three of these things and they change all throughout his life depending on which particular work of his your reading at the time\u2026understandable at one level\u2026we\u2019re reading the intellectual development of a human being that thought about stuff all the time\u2026makes sense some things would change. He talks at times about how\u2026it\u2019s an undeniable fact that most people have feelings about what is right or wrong\u2026and they feel compelled to act in a certain way about them, but even by mentioning the ideas of right or wrong implies that we had some sort of choice in the matter, so although it appears to our human experience machine that we live in a mechanistic universe where we can predict everything that\u2019s going to happen including human behavior\u2026in reality, even though we can\u2019t see it or sense it\u2026there must be a moral realm out there that is responsible for all this. We must have what we think of as free will. Again these things change all throughout his career\u2026reason is the basis for morality\u2026reason is not an object of experience\u2026point is we DON\u2019T know what this other world is like\u2026this is why he spends his career spending so much time trying to understand how we experience the world\u2026because if we can understand this human experience machine fully\u2026we can understand the limits of human knowledge. > See what we can glean from Kant here is a really interesting insight about the limits of that human knowledge. Kant would say that his belief in God is based on faith. No he doesn\u2019t know whether God exists\u2026he thinks all these philosophers trying to PROVE to you that God exists are wasting their time which is why he spends so much of his destroying their arguments. No, this is beyond anything we can ever experience. He makes a really interesting point that the first time I read Kant I must have just glossed over\u2026but he talks about be fair to me\u2026because there are two different kinds of faith. > He says that if you have faith about something that is potentially knowable\u2026then that is superstition\u2026that is detestable\u2026that is laziness\u2026intellectually unacceptable. For example, the tribal people that look at the volcano and don\u2019t understand why it sometimes shoots lava out and sometimes doesn\u2019t shoot lava out\u2026now, if you have faith that it\u2019s your act of throwing people into this volcano that\u2019s affecting it\u2026that it\u2019s somehow appeasing the volcano Gods that honor human sacrifice and that\u2019s what you blame for the frequency or infrequency of volcanic eruptions\u2026well that is superstitious, ridiculous faith to Kant. Reason being, because if you put in the leg work\u2026if you conducted experiments and studied the volcano and geology and eventually plate tectonics\u2026if you did all that, you could arrive at knowledge about when and why the volcano erupts. Tide goes in, tide goes out right? > But Kant says having faith about something that\u2019s unknowable can never be a justification for laziness\u2026there\u2019s nothing more you can do. If knowing whether God exists or not is unknowable to a human mind, then assenting to a faith based belief in it is less bad to Kant\u2026and I think he would just want us to recognize that fact. What exists\u2026is not just what we can measure and see existing in the narrow, crude, biased completely random apparatus that we\u2019ve duct taped around our heads in the year 2015. And while not many of you still listening to this episode would disagree that knowledge is power, maybe knowledge isn\u2019t the paradigm. > Maybe it\u2019s not stockpile as much knowledge as I possibly can that\u2019s the paradigm. Maybe knowledge is a bridge to something else. Maybe the reason you\u2019re listening to this podcast as opposed to another one less abrasive to what you already think you know\u2026is because maybe it\u2019s not the knowledge you want, but something else\u2026something else that usually comes along with knowledge. But I guess that\u2019s the thing\u2026I wouldn\u2019t know\u2026would I? Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_57": {"date": "2015-8-19", "text": "Posted on August 19, 2015\nEpisode 64 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #064\u00a0on Hermaneutics. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo I've been having this vision lately of someone sitting at home listening to the last few episodes of the podcast\u2026angry\u2026disappointed in the show. That's right folks\u2026I have actually been having an argument with a hypothetical person in my head for several days now\u2026and aside from this being a very obvious indicator as to why I'm such a miserable person\u2026uh it's not entirely an indictment on me being a crazy person because this person that I'm arguing with in my head is emblematic of a type of person that actually exists\u2026a person whose existence opens up a lot of interesting conversations when it comes to our episode today. For the SAKE of that conversation\u2026let's call this person\u2026Johnny.\u00a0\nJohnny likes the Philosophize This podcast\u2026he listens to it every week\u2026 and whenever he DOES listen to it he has learned that the show can typically be distilled down into two very distinct types of episodes. One is the kind of episode where we talk about things that are obviously useful in a practical sense. This could be any number of things\u2026things like how our system of government should be implemented\u2026things like what it means to live a \"good\" life\u2026Johnny loves these episodes\u2026but he can't help but notice that they're often offset sporadically by a second type of episode of the show\u2026one where this Stephen West guy who looks like he's 13 years old is wasting Johnny's time with a bunch of unverifiable metaphysical speculation.\nThese would be the episodes where we talk about metaphysical systems\u2026anything from Spinoza, Leibniz, Plotinus, Plato\u2026 point is\u2026Johnny thinks that when we're talking about all of THIS stuff\u2026when were talking about a near infinity of tiny monads flurrying around everywhere that we have no empirical basis for believing in\u2026were essentially just rambling about nonsense\u2026nonsense that has been dismantled by science over the years.\u00a0\nYou can't really blame someone for feeling like their time is being wasted when they hear rampant metaphysical speculation! After all, we've talked about a lot of it! If you just look at our history as a species, we come from a rich ancestral heritage of making these grandiose, unverifiable proclamations about the nature of existence, grandiose proclamations that have led us down some pretty dark roads\u2026at least roads where progress in other fields has been inhibited. You can't really blame someone for being born into the late 80s early 90s into this scientific age and not having a ton of patience for theories like this. Look at what they've done for us in the past! We need some sort of different criteria that we use to determine what is worth believing\u2026so enough with the nonsense\u2026enough with all this speculation\u2026let's use what is measurable and repeatable\u2026let's use science to find the closest thing to truth we can and forget all these other theories that are based on one person's pontifications.\u00a0\nBut even if we could prove that the systems of Spinoza or Leibniz or whoever are entirely false\u2026would it make the stuff that they're talking about completely useless to us? Should this hypothetical person, Johnny, skip over the episodes on Plato or Plotinus? Should he take out his earbuds and feel like his time is being wasted when he listens to those episodes?\nWhat I'm going to do on today's episode is make a case for why I think these episodes are NOT entirely useless and how ultimately the amount of value that you get out of ANY piece of information is usually determined by the amount of effort you're willing to expend when processing that information. I mean, think about it:\u00a0\nTwo people can have virtually the exact same information fed to them and have two completely different outcomes for how that information affects the lens that they view the world through. Picture two people from the same small town. They both load up all their belongings into their respective wagons\u2026they get some extra wagon axles and oxen to ford the river with and they head off to the big city to go to the university and get an education. One of those two people studies really hard, they find ways to relate the information they're learning to schemas they had in their brain in the past\u2026they're passionate about the subjects they're learning about\u2026they cultivate social situations and meet a wide range of people\u2026 they go out and have the FULL COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.\nThey could very easily return to that small town after four years and be almost an entirely different person!\u00a0\nNow on the other hand, the other person could go to school and do anything. They could lock themselves in their dorm for four years watching Netflix. They aren't passionate about their classes\u2026maybe this person just studies for the test that's at the end of that particular week and then forgets everything\u2026they cram the night before\u2026if the test is on Friday, by Friday afternoon that information they're studying has gone in one ear and out the other\u2026never really impacting them at all. Point is, this person could go back to their small town after four years and be almost unchanged by the experience! And in that sense, it's not the information so much that makes something interesting or useful in a practical sense, but the ways our brains process and relate that information to other things! If you read a book about Plato's Timaeus and think that it's boring and useless, then I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you probably have a pretty boring and useless way of looking at that information.\nNow that said: this same mentality could easily be conferred onto our episodes on Kant, right? I just\u2026I see this guy Johnny sitting at home, saying\u2026OK Kant so there's two worlds: the world of things in themselves and human experience OF that world\u2026so if that is true\u2026where does that leave me? I mean, on one hand, Kant's saying that to even try to infer things about the world of things in themselves is a waste of time\u2026and when it comes to the world of human experience\u2026well that leaves me sitting here with my earbuds in listening to some guy from the 17th century give his best interpretation of how the human mind experiences the world? What a giant waste of time! And what use is this distinction practically speaking anyway?\u00a0\nAfter all what Hume said is still true! No matter how far you're willing to go down this reductionist continuum, we still need some sort of method of interacting with the world, right? Why not use science if you're born into the late 80's early 90's?\u00a0\nNot saying that's a bad option if that's what you decide to base your beliefs on\u2026that's perfectly fine\u2026the question I'm asking is: Is Kant's point a boring or useless one? Is the idea that there are two worlds\u2026the world as it actually is and the world of our biased, limited experience of that world\u2026is that just a rambling of a 17th century Prussian monkey? Or maybe\u2026is there something useful to us in our everyday lives that we can garner from the idea that our subjective lens that we view the world through is not infallible. This is a good question that I want to come back to at the end of the show, but I want to give us some historical perspective on this and lucky for me\u2026the enlightenment period we've been talking about for so long is not just a period of massive growth in a lot of different areas of human thought\u2026it's also a period of massive growth in the field of something known as Hermaneutics.\nNow, if you've never heard the word Hermaneutics before, at first glance its probably just a really weird, confusing sounding word. \u00a0Like, what could this word be? Hermaneutics\u2026sounds like something foreign\u2026something far outside of my wheelhouse\u2026where I keep all my wheels. But what if I told you that every single person listening to this podcast engages in Hermaneutics on a daily basis? What if I told you that you're actually extremely familiar with Hermaneutics\u2026that you're actually doing it right now, as I'm saying this sentence.\u00a0\nWhen people talk about someone who is engaging in Hermaneutics, most of the time they're referring to someone who is using methods and strategies to try to accurately interpret what was trying to be conveyed by people throughout history in books, scrolls, any historical document really. Typically Hermaneutics is someone doing Biblical exegesis, interpreting philosophy, etc. but it's actually much bigger than that! I like to think of Hermaneutics as the art of interpretation!\nMaybe the best way for us to understand why Hermaneutics is such a big deal is to think about how we personally interpret the world around us every day. Consider for a second\u2026you are an interpretation machine. Just think about it: as you go about your day\u2026every single day\u2026Monday interpret\u2026Tuesday interpret\u2026everyday I'm interpreting. But what are you actually doing when you interpret things in the world? Well I wouldn't be so naive as to presume to tell you what you're doing when you're interpreting the world\u2026all I can talk about is me\u2026and what I do is look at everything around me in a very narrow context that I've arrived at after having the experiences that I've had thus far in my life.\u00a0\nLike have you ever watched the season finale of Grey's Anatomy with your parents or friends? Doesn't have to be Grey's Anatomy\u2026it could be any show that has some sort of ambiguous ending to it\u2026have you ever watched a movie or a show with other people and you come away from it at the end with different interpretations of what the artist meant to convey when they wrote that movie? Yeah, so have I, it happens a lot. Your dad thought THIS was the obvious meaning behind it\u2026your mom says no, no I didn't get that when I watched it, I got this\u2026Bruce Willis was dead the whole time! Whatever they say, the point is: where do these interpretations come from?\u00a0\nDifferent people, with different sets of experiences can interpret the exact same information very differently! And while it's all fun and games when it's a movie or the season finale of Grey's Anatomy, you can imagine how serious this interpretive task needs to be taken when we're having a multi thousand year game of telephone and trying to understand what someone was trying to convey during their time. Consider for a second that whenever someone writes down what they think is a world changing idea\u2026if I'm reading the thing\u2026the way that my brain processes and interprets that information could really be the difference between whether this information is life changing, or whether I gloss over it like I read it on the back of a cereal box. The prejudices and biases and very narrow collection of experiences that I've had over just few decades on this planet\u2026shade every thought that I have\u2026they distort everything that I read that was written by anyone else\u2026even in THIS culture and time period\u2026.let alone others!\nAnd when I say prejudices and biases, typically these words come with a negative connotation\u2026like I'm telling you that because you hate black people you're not interpreting the world correctly\u2026even though that's true, that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about biases that aren't so culturally charged, biases that you have every day of your life that are almost nothing but useful to you.\nFor example, if I'm walking down the street and I see a guy in an orange shirt and he has neon green reflective flair all over him and he's wearing a hard hat using a big heavy rake and a hula hoe to till the soil and level it out\u2026then obviously that guy is a construction worker that is prepping that area for some sort of construction project, right? But you see what I just did there? Obviously that's what he's doing! But really, there's nothing obvious about what he's doing at all. I may be right about what he's doing, but the only reason I was right in this one interpretation is because of my collection of experiences. All my experience having seen people in orange shirts and hardhats congregating around an unimproved plot of land.\nImagine if an alien from a far off galaxy landed on that culdesac and looked at that very same guy. Would it be obvious to that alien that he was prepping the area for construction? No, the alien would rightfully be confused\u2026this guy could be doing any number of things. The alien might think he's exercising\u2026like this is earth's greatest cardio routine. Maybe it would think he was doing some sort of interpretive dance. Maybe the alien would look at the obvious matching costumes of all the construction workers and assume that this is obviously some sort of cirque de soleil show going on.\u00a0\nNow if that seems ridiculous, just imagine if you and I could get on a space ship and go to that alien's home planet. How arrogant and misguided would we be to look around and pretend that we know exactly what is going on in a world and culture that is completely unfamiliar to us. Even if we had time to stick around for a while and try to understand the way the aliens lived\u2026everything about us would be looking at their world\u2026and trying to understand their world better by trying to compare it to things in our world. We would be projecting these relics of our culture and time period onto their culture and place in the universe. Even down to the most basic things! Down to what motivates this alien race\u2026even down to the questions these aliens even think are worth asking. But what can you do\u2026this is what we are\u2026interpretation machines, right? Constantly trying to make comparisons.\u00a0\nWhen we look back 2,300 years and try to understand exactly what Plato meant when he wrote every word he wrote\u2026when we read a translation of a translation of a translation and try to have a conversation using something that was etched into a scroll before Alexander the Great was even born\u2026we are essentially travelling to an alien planet.\u00a0\nRight around this time that we've been talking about there was a philosopher who is widely considered to be the first great philosopher of Hermaneutics in the modern era\u2026his name was Friedrich Schleiermacher. Schlieiermacher points out like many people before him that one of the biggest challenges someone faces when trying to understand the intent of an author behind a piece of work is understanding the true meaning of the words they were using, which is enough of a headache in itself, but Schleiermacher points out that a big piece of that that is often overlooked is understanding even seemingly insignificant characteristics about the author themselves\u2026even down to the character and personality of the author. Hermaneutics turns into a lot more, I don't want to spoil Schleiermacher too much because we're probably doing a much larger episode on Hermaneutics in the future, but the main take away is that\u2026\nWe want to think that because these people walked on two legs and that because we can relate to some sort of underlying humanity in their work that we are experts on exactly what they meant when they wrote something, but it's far from the case! Schleiermacher famously defined Hermaneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. It's so easy to project our own biases onto people from the past when we don't fully understand the cultural and historical context that they were writing in the midst of\u2026and by the way this isn't just something we reserve for people in the past\u2026we do it to each other in our present day as well!\nLike, if you've ever had a misunderstanding in a conversation\u2026you've witnessed first hand the sort of agony that bad Hermaneutics has wrought. See, because while most people think of Hermaneutics and they think of old educated white guys in clever hats interpreting the bible for the Catholic Church, in a sense, we are all practitioners of Hermaneutics. We are all different collections of experiences interacting with each other and interpreting each other. Some of us are better at interpreting than others. It's definitely a skill that is learned. We all exist at some point on this Hermaneutic skill level continuum\u2026at the top are the people that are super bright\u2026people that do exegesis for a living\u2026people that work at NASA\u2026the fine folks at Google\u2026at the bottom of this continuum are people that have next to zero critical thinking ability\u2026you know\u2026infants\u2026a jar of mayonnaise\u2026bill o'reilly\u2026you know things at that level.\u00a0\nYour interpretive ability creates your reality. Our lives are a collection of fleeting emotional states that are largely shaped by how we interpret the world around us. When you look at it that way\u2026are there many things more important than how well or accurately we interpret the world around us? In fact, if you want to take it one step further, just knowing about that separation that your experiences create\u2026just knowing that you have a very narrow collection of life experiences that are unquestionably useful when it comes to identifying construction workers, but probably not very good at understanding EXACTLY what's going on around you all over the world\u2026it seems like acknowledging that there's a difference between your world of experience and the world as it TRULY is\u2026somewhere out there\u2026 could bring you a lot of comfort.\u00a0\nRemember that guy living in my head named Johnny? So it would be very easy for Johnny to be born into the late 80's early 90's into a world where we have a long history of being misled by unverifiable speculation about metaphysics\u2026to be born into a world where science does so many great things for people\u2026to be born into a world where it is possible to hold your beliefs to what seems to be a higher standard and then to take a giant leap from there and label the systems of Berkeley, or Plotinus or Spinoza, label them a complete waste of time. To angrily slam down his headphones the moment he hears that the most recent episode is not about something that's not immediately practically useful.\u00a0\nSometimes the most profound and useful things of all aren't just lying on the ground somewhere where everyone can see them\u2026sometimes you have to do some digging. Sometimes you have to buy one of those weird metal detectors and walk around on the beach every weekend with your visor on so that one day you can have your moment in the sun where you hold up someone's lost wedding ring and celebrate on a late night infomercial. I'm speaking metaphorically of course. But how ironic that if Johnny had labeled Kan't famous distinction another useless rambling by a 17th century moron\u2026he would've missed out on the very lesson that could have prevented him from making that choice in the first place.\u00a0\nThank you for listening, I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_58": {"date": "2015-11-18", "text": "Posted on November 18, 2015\nEpisode 72 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #072\u00a0on Insecurity. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo for the last few episodes we've been talking alot about why we make the decisions we do. We've been talking about what makes a decision moral or not, how we arrive at those sorts of moral criteria, not being a passenger to the world around us\u2026 basically we've been talking alot about why we think and act the way we do. But its easy for me to imagine someone not being satisfied with this discussion so far.\u00a0\nHuman behavior. Needless to say, its a pretty complex thing. Not gonna cover it on a couple 30 minute episodes of this podcast, but we can make a dent! I could easily see someone sitting at home saying okay, now I understand the foundation of why I deem things to be right or wrong, but let's not pretend like that is the judge jury and executioner of WHY people do the things they do!\u00a0\nThink about it. There are tons of things that you and me and everyone for that matter, DO\u2026on a daily basis, that have nothing to do with whether we've deemed it to be a morally justifiable behavior. I mean, thats just not how it works. We don't go around faced with decisions in our lives and internally start talking to ourselves and say: Ok, i need to make a decision\u2026bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, or blueberry pancakes for breakfast. Hmm. Let me think about this\u2026how do i make this decision. What would JESUS do in this situation? What would a moral exemplar do\u2026what would the stoic sage do? Would the Stoic sage eat blueberry pancakes?\nPoint is, although its entirely POSSIBLE to do\u2026and some people might\u2026most of us\u2026when it comes to those rudimentary tasks of day to day living\u2026we dont make those decisions by having some internal philosophical debate with ourselves\u2026decide what the right thing to do is\u2026and then doing it. It's just not how most of us make these little decisions.\u00a0\nNow why IS there a distinction there? Why do most of us HAVE that internal philosophical debate with ourselves\u2026only when we're faced with potentially crippling life choices? We only do it with the really UNIQUE decisions in our lives\u2026not so much with the day to day.\u00a0\nWe have no problem thinking over what the right decision is when it comes to changing careers\u2026or who we should marry\u2026or what kind of cell phone plan to have\u2026which by the way Socrates said is the MOST important choice you'll ever make\u2026we do it with THOSE things\u2026but for some reason\u2026we dont\u2026do it\u2026with the little things\u2026Why is that?\nWell for one thing it would be exhausting. I mean who wants to do that, really? Having a BRAND NEW oxford style debate\u2026 in your head about every, miniscule thing you do\u2026even down to every step you take asking yourself whether that step\u2026 is bringing you closer or further away from your goals\u2026it would be PARALYZING! Not to mention probably impossible.\u00a0\nSo what do we do? Well, we pull from the archives! Previously on: Your Life. We make use of\u2026 old debates that we've had with ourselves at some other times in our life! See at some point in your life you DID\u2026actually think\u2026about whether putting one foot in front of the other foot was a good idea. You considered all kinds of things about it\u2026your gate when walking\u2026the way your foot hits the ground so you wont sprain an ankle\u2026whether you have those dr scholls arch support things in your wingtips\u2026and thats not all! You thought about whether being able to move and be mobile was a better or worse thing than being entirely stationary\u2026you thought about whether using that movement to walk to your car and drive to work was going to yield a better or worse outcome. You've done the legwork, no pun intended, and now\u2026that decision that at one point wasnt obvious to you\u2026now you just kinda\u2026ya know\u2026drive to work everyday. No philosophical debate\u2026no moral crossroad\u2026you've decided moving and having a job is an integral part of your life long ago\u2026most of us just kind of keep moving and dont question it that much.\u00a0\nStephen, why are you talking about walking. I know how to walk. Listen\u2026I get it. The question that I want to ask you today is: how many of these autopilot activities do most people have? How many do you think? No question you cant have a philosophical debate in your head about everything\u2026but how far does that extend? Whats an appropriate amount of questioning this stuff? about whether what you're doing is the right or healthy thing to do?\nSee, it's a tricky question because there's no definitive cut off point. As I said before, almost everyone does it with the really UNIQUE life decisions\u2026but how unique does a choice that you have to make need to be\u2026before its appropriate to think about what the right thing to do is?\nNow the larger point here\u2026is that because human behavior is the beast that it is\u2026and there IS no definitive\u2026agreed upon point where we're all supposed to be thinking about this stuff\u2026is that some people get lazy\u2026and they do it as little as they possibly have to. They almost NEVER contemplate morality\u2026maybe once every\u2026six months when a cop shoots someone or there's an election cycle. \u00a0\nAnd how bout this\u2026how about the fact that every single one of you listening to this show right now\u2026we all know\u2026TONS of people like this! They're all around us! We're SURROUNDED by them. I mean, all of you listening to this are the type of person that listens to educational podcasts\u2026 That says something about you! Many of you are probably identified in your groups of friends or coworkers as the person\u2026 that likes to learn and think about stuff\u2026that contrast is only possible if there is a strong percentage of the population that AREN'T thinking about stuff.\u00a0\nBut can you really blame them? There's no LAW against NOT thinking about morality\u2026no ones gonna abduct you into an immoral spaceship if you watch netflix instead of thinking about these things\u2026so it naturally follows..there's just going to be a certain percentage of people that take the path of least resistance. We see this with ANY voluntary behavior. Pople will have these exhausting, taxing philosophical debates in their head\u2026as little as they possibly have to!\u00a0\nBut the interesting thing is: their behavior hasn't stayed the same from the moment they were born. Just because they haven't contemplated morality doesn't mean they just act like a 5 year old would the rest of their life\u2026so where are they finding out how they're quote supposed to be behaving? When are they making those value judgements\u2026or better yet\u2026WHO is making the decision for them?\nWell again\u2026human behavior\u2026really complex\u2026not gonna cover it all: but I want to talk about one of them. It's something that ALL of us\u2026are very familiar with. It's not really a question of WHETHER this thing affects your behavior\u2026its a question of HOW MUCH it affects the choices you make. The thing im talking about\u2026is insecurity.\u00a0\nWhat are you insecure about? Class, I want everyone to close their eyes and think about something you're insecure about. Because, rest assured. You have insecurities that affect your behavior. You know, when I was like 18 years old I went to the first therapy session I ever went to in my adult life and I remember walking in there thinking that if you're an insecure person\u2026you go to therapy. Like really\u2026if you're one of those people that are insecure\u2026you need serious\u2026psychological\u2026help. You need some therapist to just light all that underbrush on fire\u2026burn all that stuff away and start fresh\u2026with a brand new plot of land in that brain of yours.\u00a0\nWhat I realized instantly, is that everyone is insecure about stuff. I used to think insecurity meant that you were flawed\u2026I realized that insecurity is life. Look around you\u2026 at all those beautiful people\u2026I dont care how beautiful they are\u2026they're insecure about something and it's affecting their behavior.\nIn fact, some people\u2026if you really looked at them and understood them at a deep level\u2026some people build their entire LIVES around their insecurities. Really, it's like building a house with a tree growing in the middle of it, it's not REALLY the house you want, but this thing is there. For some people\u2026 their insecurities run so deep\u2026they affect almost EVERY decision they make\u2026for some people their insecurities make up almost EVERYTHING about who they are! It's why they have the job they do, why they wear the clothes they do, what types of friends or what types of people they're in relationships with\u2026insecurity leaves no stone unturned.\nNow we all realize that insecurity is something that affects the choices we make, but is it a bad thing? I mean, we typically THINK of it as a bad thing\u2026but why? What is it about insecurity that's so wrong? Doesn't it sometimes protect us from horrible things happening to us? Well sure.\u00a0\nIn fact if you just look at insecurity\u2026it's actually really similar to morality in a lot of ways\u2026but in other ways\u2026the two are complete opposites. Think about it: morality concerns itself with\u2026you know\u2026there is this outcome that either needs to be acheived or that I want to acheive\u2026and once I assign that end goal to the equation\u2026now I can contemplate and use reason and arrive at a set of behaviors that will best produce that life that I want.\u00a0\nInsecurity is: there's a life that I DONT want. There's some thing that I desperately DONT want to happen to me. I don't want X to happen to me so I will restrict myself from X so that that world wont come to fruition. Again, they're very similar if you look at the two at face value but there's a key difference we're going to get to in a minute\u2026one that is best understood if we talk about an example of insecurity.\u00a0\nNow everyone close your eyes and think back to the days you were in school, if youre already in school GREAT! This will be easy for you. Remember shopping for school clothes? Well imagine yourself middle school, high school\u2026you come home after going to the sock hop and the ice cream parlor and your mom has a present for you on the counter. You open it up\u2026and your mom got you a brand new pair of denim overalls for you to wear for picture day at school. Yeah, thanks mom. Thanks for the overalls.\u00a0\nWell if youre anything like I was when I was 14\u2026and pretty much every 14 year old that has ever existed\u2026what are you gonna do? You're not gonna wear those overalls to school! Think of the backlash! You would be ruthlessly, socially castigated for wearing them! All your friends would laugh at you. Your enemies would laugh at you. The creepy old janitor would even be laughing at you. You would become that guy that sits in the corner in the cafeteria\u2026eating by himself\u2026people throw food at you\u2026circle around chanting something. That's YOU if you wear those overalls.\u00a0\nYou are insecure about what your friends will think of you if you wear those overalls. Now, this is a great example of how being insecure about something\u2026thinking about that future world that you DONT want to live in\u2026one filled with social reprisal and no friends and food being thrown at you\u2026you dont want to live in that world, so you're going to restrict this behavior\u2026wearing the overalls\u2026to prevent that from happening to you.\u00a0\nAgain, on the surface\u2026it seems pretty similar to morality\u2026but what's different\u2026between the two\u2026lies in understanding who is the driver of the car? Are you the passenger in the car, or the driver? The difference is: WHO is making the choices about how you should or shouldnt be behaving?\u00a0\nInsecurity robs you of your individuality\u2026of your self identity. Well, actually your self identity just becomes a conglomeration of all of the expectations that all the people around you have for how you SHOULD be behaving. You volutarily surrender your autonomy. You just become this patchwork of what your mom expects of you and what that guy you hated in highschool expects of you and what barrack obama expects of you and what the cover of cosmopolitan magazine expects of you. By not making decisions based on these philosophical moral debates about what the correct decision is\u2026we relegate ourselves to a life of just avoiding behaviors that other people expect us NOT to do.\u00a0\nNow you may be saying, well why is THAT so bad? Sure, I would get socially castigated if I decided to murder someone, maybe its a GOOD thing to fall in line with society's expectations of me! Well, that would be TRUE if the decision of whether to murder somebody was the only decision you were making. In reality, everything you do is a decision\u2026and the most interesting/relevant/terrifying part of this entire subject matter to me is: when you put these decisions in the hands of other people's social expectations of you\u2026sure, nothing bad may be happening to you at all\u2026you may go throughout your life completely happy with the way you make decisions\u2026but the problem is: you dont know what you dont know.\u00a0\nYou dont know the price that you pay in opportunity cost for any of these behaviors\u2026all you know is\u2026well I haven't gotten killed doing them yet! Gotta be doing SOMETHING right! But is the fact you haven't DIED doing something yet a valid criteria for doing it that way? What if you could be 30% happier if you were willing to have the difficult\u2026 internal philosophical debate and realize that a particular one of these expectations that someone else has for you is making you less happy than you could be?\nThere's often a cost that comes with putting your decision making into everyone else's hands.\u00a0\nIf you work at a job that you despise because it pays you 20 grand a year more than this other job that would make you not hate your life everyday\u2026and the only reason you dont is because theres these friends of yours that make alot of money and you dont want them to know that you make less money than they do a year\u2026you are paying a very real cost\u2026every single day of your life\u2026just so that you can live up to this STANDARD of\u2026 just how much money a grown man should be making when they're your age.\u00a0\nIf you're a 40 year old man and your dating life looks like a constant revolving door of 20 something year old girls\u2026and there are other women you could date that you'd be able to connect with emotionally and have a more fulfilling relationship with\u2026and the only reason you dont is because you're terrified of what your buddies are going to say when they see a picture of her. You are paying a very real price\u2026every day of your life\u2026just so that you can live up to this STANDARD of\u2026 dude your girl is hot OMG.\u00a0\nThe problem with insecurity is: what if the overalls are functional? What if you would've liked the overalls your mom bought you? What if they had a great pocket for your phone and they were comfortable and they're denim so they're stronger\u2026they're more cost efficient than other clothes. What if you could reason\u2026have one of those internal philosophical debates\u2026and arrive at the conclusion that wearing those overalls would have yielded a better life for you than not wearing them\u2026and the only reason you DIDN'T was because you were trying to live up to a standard that someone ELSE or someTHING else conferred onto you of what you SHOULDN'T be wearing?\nAgain, there's often a cost that comes with putting your decision making into everyone else's hands.\u00a0\nSee, I'd even that MOST of the time insecurity comes with an opportunity cost\u2026and the reason why is because of how completely arbitrary it is. These standards\u2026that people hvae of you\u2026the ones you're relying on to show you how you SHOULD be behaving for fear of embarrassment\u2026its not like theres some constant, static social standard that these people are appealing to. These social standards are CONSTANTLY changing! What someone would castigate you for 50 years ago is completely different than today.\u00a0\nWho was more right? What behavior was quote better?\nOn that same note\u2026there isn't one, single standard that people are holding you to. These standards DRASTICALLY change just based on the people you're seeking approval from! If you wore those overalls to school\u2026yeah your friends may laugh at you\u2026the janitor may laugh at you\u2026but those people over there that wear the cowboy hats would welcome you with open arms! If you put on the black nail polish and the black shirt of some emo band no ones ever heard of\u2026yeah\u2026some people are going to think you're a freak\u2026but there are plenty of other people that would EMBRACE and APPRECIATE how you were dressing.\u00a0\nYou can't make everyone happy! That's the warmed over truism that's relevant here. And by attaching your identity to a way your circle of friends behave and then vehemently opposing any change for fear that they will negatively judge you, is not necessarily wrong\u2026but it's certainly not a recipe for the happiest life possible.\u00a0\nNow that said, we've talking about the individual cost for not being led around by our insecurities\u2026something else to consider is the suffering that we often inadvertently cause by projecting our insecurities onto other people! \u00a0\nInsecurity just absolutely purvades every expectation we have of our significant others when were in a relationship. Well, relationships like human behavior are INCREDIBLY subjective\u2026there's no way I can paint all of them with a broad brush\u2026but the common paradigm that people strive for in most modern monogomous relationships is really founded in insecurity.\u00a0\nThink about it: there's no STANDARD about what cheating is in a relationship\u2026in the same way there's no STANDARD about what acceptable attire to wear to school is. What happens is you get a boyfriend or a girlfriend\u2026you have this\u2026most of the time unspoken verbal contract about the line that you can not cross with members of the opposite sex. This line\u2026is different in every relationship youre in. I had this girlfriend once\u2026we went through the drive through of a KFC/Taco Bell and I'm ordering my food\u2026and the person on the other end of the microphone was a girl and she was just being friendly and said something and I made a joke back to her and she audibly laughed.\u00a0\nWell I didn't think anything of it\u2026I finished the order\u2026I looked over at my girlfriend and she was just\u2026scowling at me. It was like looking into medusa's eyes. She just goes, That's disgusting. Im like what did I do? She was mad at me for the rest of the day\u2026apparently I crossed the line! We had this contract set up that I'm not supposed to make jokes to members of the opposite sex\u2026I had crossed the line. I had cheated on her\u2026RIGHT in front of her! So that was where HER line was. That was the STANDARD of what cheating is that SHE had.\u00a0\nBut there are other relationships\u2026where people can openly flirt with people and their significant other doesn't care at all! You can look\u2026but you can't touch. On that note\u2026there's perfectly healthy, functioning, loving relationships out there where you CAN touch. Where both people love eachothers company and they make eachother really happy and they dont burden themselves with having to fufill any fleeting desire their partner may have\u2026and when theyre not together they can do anything they want! The point is, there's no STANDARD of what CHEATING is\u2026but any expectation you have\u2026 of what is appropriate for your significant other to do\u2026is ultimately founded in insecurity. Again, you're not talking about your OWN behavior here\u2026you're regulating theirs! You're terrified that by having these experiences, they will like that person more than you, realize your shortcomings and leave you for them and that you're going to be all alone.\u00a0\nNow if you doubt this for even a second\u2026just consider this: how interesting that when youre in a relationship\u2026you dont restrict your significant other from most things\u2026you dont restrict them from eating pumpkin pie\u2026you dont restrict them from going to disneyland\u2026you dont restrict them from going to the mall with their friends. How convenient that there is this one, specific, subset of behaviors that you restrict them from that prevents them from finding anyone else but you.\u00a0\nWe claim to love these people\u2026we say things like I would do ANYTHING to make them happy\u2026ANYTHING. But we spend our entire lives keeping them locked in this emotional cage\u2026shutting them off from the outside world for fear they'll realize they're happier outside this cage and leave you. We essentially blackmail our significant others with the relationship. We say things like, If I find out you're going out on a date with someone else\u2026I'm breaking up with you! It's OVER!\u00a0\nReally, thats the relationship you want to be in? The only thing stopping your significant other from dating someone else is the fear that she can't talk to you anymore and you're going to remove her on facebook? One thing should be very clear here\u2026this strategy has nothing to with morality and everything to do with appeasing insecurity\u2026and its a FALSE sense of security at that.\u00a0\nLet's say that the plan works. Your girlfriend FEELS INSIDE like there is a void that needs to be filled\u2026she FEELS like going on a date with the guy from work\u2026but doesn't act on those feelings out of respect to your wishes being a piece of your property. I got news! She's STILL THE SAME PERSON whether you have that expectation of her or not! She still WANTS to go on the date\u2026you're just blocking the exit with a fire extinguisher. She still lives every day of her life\u2026 for god knows how long\u2026secretly feeling like some other life might make her happier, but not acting on it because of the insecurity you've projected onto her.\u00a0\nThis really is what our insecurities can do to the people around us that we claim to love so much. If I met a perfect stranger walking down the street and they approached me and told me there was this thing that they were thinking about doing that they think would make them a happier person and asked me if they should do it\u2026I would say absolutely before they even finished the sentence.\u00a0\nBut for the person that I supposedly love more than anyone\u2026I reserve this extra special way of treating them\u2026I'm willing to force them to spend the duration of our relationship locked inside of an emotional cage simply because I am terrified of looking at myself in the mirror and acknowledging that someone else might be better for them. Someone else might make them happier. This insecurity makes us sound downright sadistic. Oh you think you'd be happier with another life, but it's my job to restrict you or bully you into not doing it?\nThe point of this long winded rant about relationships is that when we're satisfied with having our behavior controlled by our insecurities that are COMPLETELY arbitrary\u2026we don't ONLY hurt ourselves with the opportunity cost, we potentially hurt other people around us with the ones we impose on them. That's the other thing\u2026let's say your WORST NIGHTMARE comes to life\u2026let's say your girlfriend or boyfriend leaves you for someone else because you let them go on a date and they liked them more than you\u2026isnt that information you would want to have? How many of you have been in a relationship WAY LONGER than you should have? Youre together for a year two years\u2026seven years and you find out there is some fundamental disagreement that is a dealbreaker\u2026that couldve easily shown itself two weeks into the relationship if we were playing this insecurity riddled game. Just saying, it benefits you too when you're making decisions with good information.\u00a0\nQuestioning morality is the antidote to insecurity. But its not a panacea. All of us listening to this will continue to have things were insecure about\u2026they will continue to cause you to look in the mirror and kind of turn side to side and feel inadequate because you dont perfectly embody this generations paradigm of beauty. they will continue to cause you to turn red and be embarrassed when you slip up speaking in front of a group. All I'm saying is how much or little these insecurities affect our decision making and our identity its not out of our control. And I guess what I'm also saying is\u2026I would never judge or laugh at anyone for wearing overalls. I don't look at myself as the litmus test that I dunk in everyones choices and tell you whether you're red or blue. What I'm saying is: if you feel insecure all the time\u2026maybe the thing that makes you feel insecure is not you\u2026maybe its the people you're hanging around with.\n\u00a0You know that game show variation of the prisoners dilemma? You know the game works like this\u2026there's 20 dollars up for grabs. You and one other person have to decide what you're going to do, and you cant tell the other person what you're going to do. Your choices are to either share the money with the other person\u2026or steal the money for yourself. But the other person has the same choice. Now if you both decide the SHARE the money, if thats what you both choose\u2026you each get half. If both of you decide to steal the money, neither of you get anything. If one decides to share and the other to steal\u2026the person that stole gets all of the money.\u00a0\nNow what would you choose to do? Would you steal the money or share it? Keep in mind, if you choose to share\u2026you have no idea if the other person is just going to steal it from you! Well BY FAR\u2026the most COMMON thing that people choose to do here is steal the money. And when we think about this question of what drives us to make the decisions we do\u2026we can understand the reasoning\u2026and it is entirely fueled by not what the RIGHT thing to do is, but what future world we want to prevent for fear of social reprisal. Thats a long winded way of saying its just like insecurity.\u00a0\nThese people playing this game show, just like an insecure person making life choices, would restrict the possibility of sharing the money with the other person, for fear of getting taken advantage of and embarrassed by the other person. What if the other person steals the money from me\u2026I'll be ruined! They've asserted themselves as superior to me!\nWell, its a good parrallel to insecurity but they could just be doing it because if you steal you either get all of it or nothing\u2026if you share you get half of it or nothing. Uh, but I hope these episodes are helping us understand the variety of different reasons people use when making a decision. The larger point for this podcast is: when is it acceptable to hold someone morally cupable for an action? It's very easy for us to arrive at our own personal code for how other people SHOULD be behaving\u2026and when they do something we dont like\u2026attack them and hold them morally accountable for it\u2026but in reality. Think about it: they may not be making a moral choice at all. As we head into future episodes\u2026think of the peace that comes along with understanding that. \u00a0\n\n\nThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_59": {"date": "2015-12-1", "text": "Posted on December 1, 2015\nEpisode 73 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #073\u00a0on Logical Fallacies. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's the holiday season everyone. Christmas is in the air! In fact, every holiday Starbucks has unjustly declared war on with their cups\u2026is in the air right now\u2026and we all know what that means! Family is coming over, you're embracing them lovingly, you're making food together, playing games\u2026but as we all know something that's just as much of a fixture in the holidays as mistletoe and pumpkin pie\u2026is the inevitable argument with one of your family members about some sort of problem that they have with a particular race, creed or socio-economic bracket of people. It's just inevitable! Grandma Beatrice grew up in a different world than you did and by golly\u2026 is she going to fight to the death to make ours return to the way things once were when things were better. The argument is unavoidable.\u00a0\nNow many of you having these sorts of conversations, disagreeing with Grandma Beatrice, may find yourself stuck in a particular place\u2026its a place that I think 100% of the people listening to this can relate to\u2026we've all been here at least at SOME point in our life and the place is this: you're having a discussion with some other party, the other party presents to you WHY they have the beliefs they do about something, and in that moment you can just tell\u2026that something is very, very wrong about their argument. You get this unmistakable feeling in your stomach like, no\u2026there's something wrong about that\u2026but you can't really pinpoint exactly what it is that's wrong about it.\u00a0\nThe problem with this is that it's very hard to launch a convincing argument BACK to this person if you don't know exactly what part of the argument you should be attacking. You know, I'd compare it to physically launching an attack against a bunker or a fortified position in an actual war. You don't want to run up to the reinforced steel of the bunker and just start beating your head into it\u2026no, you find the creases! You find the weak points! That's where you launch your attack!\nWell funny enough, these disagreements with friends, family members or loved ones are not the only places these arguments take place. In fact\u2026THEY'RE EVERYWHERE! With our coworkers about what the best course of action is to move forward on a project\u2026with our spouses about whether we were out of line when we made too much noise in the kitchen\u2026and yes\u2026as you probably guessed\u2026these arguments are an INTEGRAL PART of what it means to be conducting philosophy.\u00a0\nThink about it: when Hegel is trying to make improvements on Kant's work or when Kant is improving upon Hume or when Hume is improving upon Locke\u2026a HUGE part of what they're doing when they're trying to improve upon their work is looking back and trying to find the dishonest assumptions that they use as a justification for why something MUST be the case. The entire history of this show so far has really been one generation's polymath genius conducting this type of analysis on the PREVIOUS generation's polymath genius. Kant is essentially grandma Beatrice to Hegel's Christmas dinner. And \u00a0as a podcaster that has this is the format of the show, it would be EASY for me to overlook that whenever you engage in any sort of philosophical discourse that is productive\u2026you know whenever you guys out there interested in philosophy are actually HAVING discussions about these topics\u2026you can have all the information in the world about any of these thinkers, but if you're unskilled at or incapable of conducting a philosophical argument with someone you disagree with, all of this information is just that: information. Not really useful at all at trying to arrive at something productive BY VIRTUE of knowing that information.\u00a0\nMake no mistake, whether you're engaging with your philosophy professor, your local senator, the guy at the grocery store or EVEN GRANDMA BEATRICE\u2026you are engaging in a philosophical discussion. And being able to quickly identify the crease in the bunker\u2026being able to quickly identify the problem at the foundation of the argument that any of these people are making, is one of the most powerful skills you can possess.\nSo how do you get it? Well you look at a LOT of arguments. Thousands. Eventually it gets broken down into formal logic. And to save you time, the pot of gold you'll find\u2026at the end of that rainbow, if you look at thousands and thousands of arguments that people make for why they hold the beliefs they do\u2026is that although there are hundreds of faulty justifications people give\u2026by and large\u2026across the board\u2026no matter WHAT subject we're talking about\u2026football, healthcare, welfare, civil rights, or the newest harry potter book\u2026people pretty much use the same ones over and over again\u2026they pretty much use and recycle the same 10 to 15 of these arguments\u2026these are just the common ways that people simplify an issue in an attempt to understand it. These \"justifications\" that people give\u2026are more commonly known as fallacies.\u00a0\nSo what this episode is\u2026is a handbook of sorts. We're going to be going over the most common fallacies of argument that you're going to face when you have a philosophical discussion with someone. I see this as an episode that is LONG overdue, this is usually covered in most philosophy 101 classes\u2026I see this as an episode that you can hopefully return back to as a refresher course if you ever forget any of them\u2026and I'm honestly having a hard time thinking of any other \u00a0episode of this show that if you memorized the contents of it\u2026would be more valuable to you practically speaking. I'm here to tell you: when you memorize even just the 5 MOST common fallacies that people have at the root of their arguments, you start to see them everywhere! \u00a0The world changes all around you and when you're around the water cooler and someone says something that just feels wrong and you don't know why\u2026instead of just having a strong suspicion that something is wrong\u2026now you'll have the ability to instantly pinpoint exactly where the flaw is in the thinking\u2026and that comes with many rewards: you can have more productive conversations, be less frustrated, help your friends and family more when they're confused, you yourself will be less susceptible of succumbing to bad arguments\u2026this really is a skill that in my opinion should be taught to every kindergartner in the entire world\u2026 and it is beyond me why it isn't.\u00a0\nSo with that said, let's get into it: The first common fallacy that somebody might use against you in an argument is called the argument from consequences. Also known as the APPEAL to consequences fallacy\u2026this is an incredibly common one and it goes like this\u2026 someone will argue for how TRUE or false something is by appealing to how much they like the consequences that arise if that things ends up BEING true. In other words, just because IF something was true it makes your life better, doesn't mean that it is actually true.\u00a0\nOne of the most common ways people use this fallacy is something like: you know, if God doesn't exist, then what does that mean for human behavior? If God doesn't exist then there's no moral accountability! A Tsumami of rape and murder, is that a world you want to live in? Therefore, God must exist!\nNow if you're doubting whether people actually use this argument or not, understand that even otherwise INCREDIBLY intelligent people are guilty of falling into this trap! This is the exact argument that Bryan Callen made on his podcast FOR YEARS whenever he had someone on that even loosely alluded to the possibility of a God existing, Bryan would say: I believe that God exists because I don't want to live in a world where there is no God! That's just not a world I want to live in!\nWell you can see the problem with the thinking there right? Just because a particular human being WANTS something to be true, has nothing to do with whether it is ACTUALLY true. Truth is something separate from human perception. Even if every human being ceased to exist on this entire planet, most of us would agree that there would still be a way that things ACTUALLY are, right\u2026independent of what Bryan Callen or anybody else WANTS to be true.\nNow I'm sure if you talked to Bryan Callen he would say that of course this is a fallacy ridden argument, but this isn't a scientific claim I'm making\u2026this is a pragmatic one! This belief helps me! It brings ME solace! Well that's fine\u2026and maybe there's no opportunity cost on YOUR end\u2026but you can at least acknowledge how being satisfied with this fallacy ruling your beliefs BREEDS complacency, right? Tell you what, I don't want to live in a world where there are millions of hungry children that go to bed each night living with a tarp as the wall to their house in third world countries. It's just NOT a world I want to live in! So therefore, the food must exist on their table each night! They must NOT be going to bed hungry!\u00a0\nThis is the potential cost of the argument from consequences.\u00a0\nIf X, then Y will happen.\nY is a good outcome.\nTherefore, X is true.\nIt could be anything\u2026It could be your friend saying that they love building and driving cars, so because of that\u2026they are vehemently opposed to the idea of self driving cars. It could be your mom saying that she LOVES the idea of us being able to visit other galaxies, so therefore she believes that we're going to be able to build a intergalactic spaceship in her lifetime. Whatever it is, the core argument is the same\u2026it's the argument from consequences and we need to be careful to not muddle up what the TRUTH actually is with what we WANT the truth to be as human beings.\u00a0\nAnd it should be said that, finding this fallacy can be a little tricky. It seems really obvious, it seems like you'd be able to spot this one a mile away, but I think the reason so many people don't INSTANTLY identify this as a faulty argument when they hear it is because there actually ARE a lot of situations when it IS an appropriate argument to use.\u00a0\nFor example\u2026 if a politician is lobbying congress and they argue that we should adopt their new criminal justice policy because if we did\u2026 the world will see a 90% reduction in crime. Well, that too is appealing to the consequences to make a case. They're saying we should agree with this policy because the world would be a better place for the people if we did!\nBut there's a big difference there! The difference between THAT and what we were talking about before is that one is a proposition about what might make the world a better place and the OTHER is a proposition justifying what we should believe and what is objectively true. It's when we start to use the argument from consequences to make claims about what is true that we start to run into problems.\u00a0\nThe second common fallacy were going to be talking about today is known as Affirming the Consequent. When someone is affirming the consequent they are inferring the truth of the antecedent of a conditional statement from the truth of the conditional and its consequent. Alright, moving on. Just kidding\u2026you guys really thought I was gonna leave you there? That's not what this show's about! What that's saying in fancy philosophical lingo is that just because you know that if something happened, a specific consequence would result from it\u2026and you live in a world where that consequence is reality, you can't assume that that one thing that would have caused the consequence happened\u2026 just because the consequence is there. In other words, you might say that if the cashier down at the grocery store won the lottery, she would be happy. And you might go down to the grocery store one day, go through her line and see that she is really happy. Affirming the consequent would be saying, Oh she's happy! She won the lottery!\nNow the problem with this way of thinking is that yes, it may be true that if the cashier won the lottery she would be happy, but there are many other explanations for WHY the cashier might be happy that have nothing to do with 5 random balls being pulled out of a spinning machine. What if she just got a promotion? What if she just got a new boyfriend? What if she listened to the episodes on moodiness and has a new lease on life? The possibilities are endless, so it's WRONG to use a consequence to affirm an antecedent.\u00a0\nThe best way to get a handle on this one is just to give real world examples that you're bound to hear if you talk to people. You know\u2026If someone was going to be a truly great president\u2026they would've obviously been able to see this long period of economic stagnation in our country WAY AHEAD of time. Donald Trump saw it coming. Therefore, Donald Trump would make a truly great president.\u00a0\nYou can see how this one's flawed. We have no way of knowing HOW Donald Trump came to that conclusion ahead of time. Yeah he could've gotten it by being an economic scholar\u2026he could also have gotten it by calling Ms. Cleo the psychic on late night TV. Now this by no means proves that Donald Trump WOULDN'T be a great president, but it goes the other way too. It doesn't prove that he would. The difference is, one person's making an argument that it would.\u00a0\nAnother example\u2026you can imagine talking to a friend of yours that believes in god using this argument as well. They might say, if God existed\u2026then we would obviously be able to see unparalleled beauty and complexity in the works of nature. And look at the human eye! Look at how beautiful the natural world is! Therefore, God must exist.\u00a0\nWell again, this is affirming the consequent. There are many other explanations for why we might see beauty and complexity in the natural world than a supernatural God existing, so just because we see it\u2026that isn't necessarily a knockdown argument that God exists.\u00a0\nImagine talking to your significant other. If you were cheating on me right before I got off work then you would have been late when picking me up from work! You were an hour late. Therefore, you must be cheating on me! Obviously, there are dozens of explanations for why someone could be an hour late that have nothing to do with whether they were cheating on you. Maybe they got a flat tire, maybe they fell asleep, maybe they forgot\u2026You can't use a particular consequence that is present in the world to infer an antecedent, that's the point.\u00a0\nThe next common fallacy people use in arguments is the appeal to ignorance or the argument from ignorance fallacy. Now there's many variants this one takes the general idea goes like this: that we can assume that some thing is true, simply because there is no evidence that has been presented that says that it's NOT true. There's no evidence that PROVES Bigfoot DOESN'T exist, so therefore, it must exist. There's no definitive, conclusive evidence that PROVES, two humble hobbits didn't go on an unexpected journey traveling on hairy feet to return the ring of power to the fires of Mt. Doom. Therefore, it MUST have happened.\u00a0\nNow we see this fallacy everywhere, it's just cloaked in clever ways. There's a famous usage of it in american politics with George W. Bush was running for president\u2026Dan Rather, the anchor for CBS news pointed to documents that seemed to be alluding to the fact that George W. Bush hadn't been so clean cut and honorable during his time in the National Guard, and the way that they combatted this criticism was to accuse Dan Rather of using forged documents to make the president look bad. Now this is a brilliant way to cloak the argument from ignorance fallacy.\nNow, for Dan Rather to dismiss these claims and regain the legitimacy of what he's saying\u2026now he needs to find some way to PROVE that the documents weren't forged. But how can you do that? Seems pretty difficult to PROVE that something wasn't forged and even if you somehow COULD prove it, by the time you have\u2026 the argument has gone off on such a tangent that rarely people ever remember why proving it was important in the first place. I bet you guys see this tactic in your arguments all the time.\nWhat happens a lot of times is people hide behind that stage of \"gathering definitive evidence\" because they KNOW it will next to impossible or exhausting to actually gather what both parties deem to be definitive evidence.\u00a0\nFor example you might say to a friend or a significant other: I don't like how frequently you've been having a bad day, coming home from work and taking out your day on me! Can we try to find some compromise here? The other person might use the argument from ignorance and say, you think I AM treating you poorly, I think I'm NOT treating you poorly. There's no definitive evidence that says I AM treating you poorly, so until you can provide it, I must NOT be treating you poorly. Well rarely is anyone gonna have a written chronology of all the times you've come home from work and been a jerk to them. And how EASY it is retrospectively to shut down most examples they give as NOT what their criticism initially was. What ends up happening most of the time is a stalemate. Turns out there WAS no problem after all!\nBut this appeal to ignorance argument takes a lot of different forms, one of the most common in day to day conversations is what's called the personal incredulity variant. And I'm sure a few of you saw this one coming. I mean after all if the root of the argument from ignorance is that we can believe something because it hasn't been completely DISPROVEN yet, then when applied on a personal level, this can be a really convenient way to justify believing in whatever you currently believe and never questioning it\u2026 until the end of time.\u00a0\nBecause now, if we want to COMPLETELY disprove something\u2026we don't have the collective knowledge of the history of humanity to pull from\u2026with the personal incredulity fallacy, all we have now is whatever seems reasonable to one person's brain\u2026right at this very moment. What I'm saying is in other words, because something is really difficult for them to understand, they assume that it must not be true.\u00a0\nLet's talk about some examples of this we might hear talking to people. You think the Egyptians built the pyramids? What are you stupid? You actually can believe that people carving stuff into stone and living thousands of years before the common era could carve, move and set slabs of limestone THAT large? What are you crazy? Obviously it didn't happen!\nNow, the problem is not with believing that there may be alternative explanations for what we see in recorded history, the problem is with THIS particular argument. That because this person can't imagine how they ever could have pulled off this feat, that it must have never happened. You can see the problem with this. What this person \"FEELS\" should be possible is really just an arbitrary collection of impressions they've gotten from their short time on this planet. People also do this sitting on their couch and make judgement about what was possible in other areas of expertise that they have no clue about.\nOh I just can't imagine how we could ever have gone from pond scum\u2026single celled organisms crawling around in a puddle to what we are today. Do you really think that happened? By random chance we just evolve into the incredible creatures we are today? There's no way that's true.\u00a0\nAgain, there's nothing wrong with questioning the current scientific narrative, but if your only basis for not believing something is that intuitively to you it doesn't make sense, maybe the assistant manager at Wendy's is not the best gauge for determining what is possible in the universe.\nThe next common fallacy we're going to talk about, is the slippery slope fallacy\u2026.and the explanations of these can speed up a bit because I think you guys are getting the idea of what a fallacy is and how it's used. What the slippery slope fallacy tries to do is make the case that a certain position is bad because the acceptance of it will bring about not just it, but a SEQUENCE of events that will be horrible.\u00a0\nFor example, I was talking to two people a few years ago around when Washington legalized gay marriage and they told me that the reason they could never in good conscience support gay marriage is because once you let them get married\u2026the next thing you know there's gonna be gays on every street corner, making out with each other, feeling each other up\u2026is that the world you want to live in?\nThis was seriously their argument. And I instantly identified it as the slippery slope fallacy. The main tactic is the sidestep the discussion of the actual thing you're having a discussion about, conclude ALL ON YOUR OWN that that thing you're discussing is going to lead to this HORRIBLE OUTCOME and then ask the person you're arguing against to defend this horrible outcome. The funniest part about this one was that they showed their hands when they used people making out on the street as their \"HORRIBLE OUTCOME\".\u00a0\nAnyway, people use this all the time\u2026it's a pretty easy one to spot. We shouldn't give people food stamps! First you give people food stamps, next thing you know we're living in a communist nanny state! We shouldn't EVER intervene militarily! First we're sending a few thousand people to keep the peace, next we're colonizing the globe like dictators! Again, I'm sure you guys will spot this one pretty easy.\nThe next fallacy we're going to talk about is the straw man fallacy. This is a common one, especially when you're winning an argument, so especially keep an eye out for it then. The straw man fallacy is committed when someone takes your argument and paints a cartoonish, simplified, ridiculous version of it in an attempt to have an easy target to attack when THEY'RE arguing. Hence the \"straw man\". The HOPE of somebody putting up a straw man is that the person they're arguing with not realizing that it is actually NOT what they're arguing because they see glimmers of their position. Then when they TRY to defend the straw man, they are lead to think that their argument was worse than it actually was.\u00a0\nWe see examples of this all the time. Someone could say, \"I believe in God.\" Now a strawman that someone could put up here would be, \"what you believe there's an old white guy with a beard and a staff up in the sky that's watching you all the time? Wow!\"\nSomeone could say, \"I think that we shouldn't spend 600 billion dollars a year in military spending!\" A straw man might be, \"I can't believe you're in favor of leaving our country completely defenseless if we are ever attacked. First you cut military spending, then terrorists are blowing buildings up daily in every major city!\"\nThat was a fun combination of the straw man AND the slippery slope fallacy.\u00a0\nPoint is, mischaracterizing an idea and making it into a worse argument that is EASY to refute\u2026is MUCH easier than actually understanding the issues fully and refuting a more nuanced argument. The straw man fallacy is a great way to avoid productive discussion.\u00a0\nAnother fallacy people commonly use is what's known as an ad hominem argument. Simply put this is an argument where instead of focusing on what the two of you are actually arguing about, as a diversion tactic, someone will attack you personally in an attempt to discredit the SOURCE of the information\u2026 so that they don't have to argue against what you're actually saying. Usually people resort to this when they're LOSING an argument and they have no other recourse.\u00a0\nYou might say, \"I don't think its a good idea to be throwing your cat off of a second story building!\" They might say, \"oh yeah, coming from the guy that never had a cat before?\" You might say, \"I don't think it's a good idea for you to hit me when you get mad at me!\" They might say, \"Well if you weren't such a moron and knew anything about how people deal with frustration, then you'd KNOW wouldn't you.\"\nThe variants of this are endless, this is probably one of the most common ones the average person will see just because it's such a knee-jerk response by people when someone disagrees with them and they can't think of a reason why they're wrong\u2026to find a way to SIDESTEP refuting their argument and discredit the SOURCE of the information. Because if you can discredit the source, then you dont have to look at your beliefs honestly and you can ignore everything that comes out of that source. What I like to do when someone ad hominems me is say, OK, I'm a moron, I'm mistaken fine. Let's do a thought experiment. Picture someone you actually respect. Now pretend the words I just said came out of their mouth\u2026how would you respond to them? What would you say to that argument if somebody you respect was the one that said it?\nAnother fallacy that someone might use on you in an argument is the fallacy of false equivalence. This is a REALLY common one especially in the news media \u2026. so as most people outsource their understanding of issues to the news, it usually extends into conversations with people because they're parroting what the guy on the news said. False equivalence, as you can probably guess, is a fallacy where the goal is to use one or two attributes about a thing and use those to pretend as though both things are the same. A common example used to illustrate this fallacy is that both cats and dogs are fluffy, therefore cats and dogs are basically the same!\nNow the REAL world implications of this are massive. Most of the time it's used when it comes to evidence, people will say\u2026you know\u2026some scientists have done studies that prove that humans are increasing the rate of climate change\u2026some scientists have done studies that prove they aren't. It's a stale mate!\nNow whatever side of this issue you fall on, you have to see the problem here. Just because both sides have done studies does not mean the studies are equally legitimate, are conducted honestly, are of a sample size that is worthy of testing\u2026how MANY studies have been done\u2026.there are a lot of other things to consider about either side, things that will probably shine light on which side is more legitimate. This fallacy really aims to mask weaknesses in an argument by aligning one property of it with the properties of another that actually IS legitimate. George Washington wore a hairpiece and Donald TRUMP wore a hairpiece, they obviously are both very like-minded individuals!\nI'll talk about one more fallacy\u2026this episodes getting pretty long. sorry about that. i could talk about this stuff forever. but the last one is what's called the appeal to the bandwagon fallacy. the argument says that because a ton of people believe in something, or because the majority of people believe in something that it must be true. we hear this one a lot\u2026just turn on your television set. practically every commercial has this at the core of why you should buy their product. their argument is that look! hundreds of people all prancing around drinking a dr. pepper! Can 200 smiling faces chugging down Dr. Pepper be lying to you? Of course not! You know its good\u2026just TRY IT! Look at how happy it made all THESE PEOPLE!\nThe point is, how many people think something is the case has nothing to do with whether it actually is the case or not. Millions of people used to believe that the earth was flat. The fact that they believed it didn't make it true. That said, billions of people today think that the earth is a sphere. The fact that they believe it isn't what makes it true or untrue, it's based on empirical data. Or, if you're one of those flat earth people on YouTube\u2026its based on a massive conspiracy to pull the wool over people's eyes and convince them that the earth IS NOT flat. I still haven't gotten far enough into one of those videos to find out why its important to feed people this lie.\u00a0\nThat said, I hope this episode was helpful. And trust me, if you listen and re-listen to this and memorize them and how to spot them, you will begin to see these fallacies everywhere. You will begin to see that no matter what topic you're talking to someone about, we're almost ALWAYS guilty of the same few logical fallacies. What a fantastic way to INSTANTLY make yourself more proficient in any discussion you may have whether it's with your boss, or aunt Beatrice.\nThank you for listening ill talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_60": {"date": "2015-12-17", "text": "Posted on December 17, 2015\nEpisode 74 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #074\u00a0on Hegel. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo on the off chance the last few episodes of the show have seemed like kind of a departure from what we typically do on this show, uh well you're probably right. And whether this was a welcome departure or an unwelcome departure really comes down to what you want out of this show\u2026for the longest time we were talking about a SINGLE section of a SINGLE philosopher and all of a sudden we're talking about moodiness and insecurity and veganism\u2026and although there is NO DOUBT relevance between that stuff and what we're going to be talking about today\u2026I just want to let you know that if it seems like I've been stalling\u2026it's because I HAVE been stalling.\u00a0\nLook, as I alluded to before I feel an obligation to these thinkers to do their work justice. I don't wanna give a biased or cursory overview of the cause they committed their entire lives to. I respect Hegel. And as I said at the beginning of our Hegel episodes, he is notoriously considered one of the most if not THE MOST difficult read in all of philosophy. This difficulty extends to yours truly as I'm doing the research for this show. I've spent the last month and a half re-reading Hegel.\u00a0\nAnd it should be said that its not like these episodes that we did are useless\u2026in fact they kind of opened my eyes to just how much stuff I've been neglecting about HOW to be conducting philosophy in the first place\u2026stuff that is easy to talk about in a classroom setting with people raising their hands\u2026but a little more difficult when each episode is focusing on one particular thinker and their work. So you can expect those types of episodes sprinkled in in the future.\u00a0\nBut this is a very long winded way of saying that what I realized at the end of this long, agonizing process of sitting in a smoking jacket reading Hegel with my trusty manacle\u2026is that the problem wasn't with how well i understood Hegel\u2026the problem was with when I first sat down to plan out all the Hegel episodes\u2026I planned out around 3-4 episodes that really went against everything that makes this show what it is.\u00a0\nSee because as you guys well know\u2026this show isn't about just spewing a ton of random facts at you\u2026you know Hegel was born on August 27th 1770 to doctor Hanz von Winklestein at Stuttgart General Hospital. No, that's not what this show is\u2026this show is about giving CONTEXT to information so it actually means something to you\u2026because that's kinda the whole thing with human beings, we remember what is important to us\u2026not random facts.\u00a0\nSee I got so caught up\u2026so lost in trying to give you all this information about Hegel's take on all of these different things we've talked about on the show so far, that I completely FORGOT about the fact that there might be no one in the history of the world whose ideas are more responsible for the way that the world is in 2015 THAN Hegel. Kind of a big thing to overlook, but it was eye opening to me.\nBecause as we all know\u2026there's a direct connection between beliefs and actions. We act based on our best guess of what we BELIEVE to be true. Look no further than reports on your local news to see that this is true. You know, and in a weird way, people love to study the darker side of humanity. They love to marvel at what human beings are capable of at their worst. We love to hear about great battles where millions of people die\u2026we love to hear about serial killers and wonder, how could this person ever be able to do something like this? We love to hear about evil tyrants subjugating people and wonder, how could this ever have seemed right to them?\u00a0\nBut make no mistake\u2026go to your local library, sit next to the friendly homeless man reading the USA today, open up every history book they have and what you'll find is that if the thing in the book actually happened it was ultimately done because of a belief that someone had about what the right thing to do is in a given situation. In this way, this teeny sub-branch of philosophy\u2026is indirectly responsible for all of it. Arriving at new ideas and then analyzing what makes them worth believing is really the ONE thing that affects EVERYTHING.\u00a0\nAnd in this way, I like to think of ideas not as fixed things\u2026i think of ideas as seeds\u2026seeds that have the potential to grow into something bigger. You know, look at a seed. Somewhere\u2026deep down in that seed is a ton of information that we're not seeing\u2026a programming of sorts\u2026in that seed before it's ever put in the dirt is the potential to become a giant tree. And in this way\u2026there are ideas all around us that are no doubt like saplings\u2026that if they were taken to their full potential would fundamentally transform the world, it's just a matter of time before we learn how much water and sunlight they need.\u00a0\nJust consider the fact that some guy named professor Hegel in the early 1800's was probably sitting in his front room one night with HIS trusty manacle\u2026and he had an idea\u2026you know his neurons fired in a certain way in that moment that caused him to arrive at an idea that he would eventually write down and it would eventually go on to change the ENTIRE political landscape of the 20th century. If his neurons had fired slightly differently, maybe we live in a completely different world, maybe tens of millions of people don't die, maybe the atomic bomb is never created. But all of this started\u2026 with an idea. And idea that was in response to a question\u2026and the question was: What does it mean to be truly free, and what are the natural implications of this?\nNow, it's been a few weeks since we talked about this, so I just want to clarify a few things.\u00a0\nTo understand Hegel's answer to this question\u2026we need to understand what he's responding to in Kant's work. Kant talks about human nature. He sees it as a really static thing. He thinks that\u2026it is an inescapable aspect of human nature that we find ourselves constantly in this state of being pushed and pulled around between two things: one is our faculty of reason and the other are the animalistic desires we have. Sometimes we give in to those desires\u2026other times we are able to use reason to overcome them and do the moral thing\u2026and Kant's position is a little more complex than that but the main point is that this internal battle is a part of our human nature.\nWell Hegel looks at that and goes\u2026what are we even talking about when we talk about human nature? Is human nature some fixed, unchanging, static thing that we can look to to explain human behavior?\nPeople do this all the time: it's HUMAN NATURE to be warlike. It's human nature to be selfish\u2026even I do it sometimes\u2026I say humans by nature take the path of least resistance. But its one thing to say this is usually what most human beings do, and its another thing to etch that theory into stone and say that its somehow part of the nature of every human being who has ever lived. That's a very different statement.\nSo Hegel starts thinking about human nature. Obviously there are some things that are true about every human being that has ever lived\u2026but is being in this battle between reason and our desires one of them? Is there maybe a different explanation?\nSo what Hegel does is say, look if this is truly a part of human nature, then we should see it across all cultures and all time periods right? And it turns out\u2026there's exceptions to this rule all over the place\u2026Hegel uses ancient Greece as an example\u2026well ancient Athens pre-400 BC\u2026very unique time in the history of Athens\u2026he points out how\u2026before Socrates came along\u2026people didn't have the same sort of individual compass that Kant is talking about here.\u00a0\nI mean think about it\u2026the very fact that Socrates was trying to get people to ASK these questions about individual morality\u2026came across as abrasive and eventually got him sentenced to death\u2026remember the charges? \"corrupting the youth\". Corrupting them from what?\nNow Hegel takes a pretty interesting position here\u2026maybe instead of us having some fixed internal nature that positions us at the center of this constant battle between reason and passions\u2026.maybe many of these things we commonly attribute to being human nature are really just values programmed into us by whatever time period or culture or even just what state, city or neighborhood we live in. Maybe so many of the beliefs we have about how things should be\u2026so much of our identities as people\u2026maybe in a strange sense\u2026they were completely out of our control from the beginning.\u00a0\nHegel even plays out the Socrates example to explain how this individual sense of morality may have come about\u2026he says\u2026so Socrates bursts onto the scene in Athens\u2026morally accosts people in the public square\u2026eventually, people get pretty annoyed about it and sentence him to death for corrupting some aspect of their culture. Now many of us that hear this story would say\u2026well no\u2026Socrates wasn't corrupting anything\u2026he was just asking questions! What you cant handle your beliefs being challenged? But what HEGEL says is that the Athenians may have been perfectly JUSTIFIED in sentencing him to death. If a death sentence was a just punishment for corrupting the youth back then, then Hegel points out\u2026Socrates was GUILTY of corrupting them.\u00a0\nWe may not see it as corruption in today's world. What Socrates did may have ONLY brought about something that we see as a better world. But Hegel points out that in the context of the culture and time that Socrates was living\u2026bringing about the change he did\u2026REQUIRED this sort of abrasive\u2026conflicting interest with popular opinion. You know one of my favorite John Locke quotes: New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not already common.\nHegel extrapolates here and says that there was a way that things were in Athens\u2026Socrates comes along\u2026conflicting interest\u2026in opposition to the way things were\u2026and that the result of these two powerful forces meeting is a SYNTHESIS of the two in the middle somewhere\u2026a combination\u2026a composition.\u00a0\nThis is what Hegel calls the dialectic. Thesis (the way things are) antithesis (the thing opposed to this way that things are) and synthesis (the meeting of the two in the middle). We can see how this works on a cultural or political level, but it's funny\u2026it even describes the ways we change individual decisions in our lives.\u00a0\nLike one week you might eat 100% for taste\u2026then a competing interest might arise\u2026oh well I feel horrible and i'm getting fat\u2026this week I'll eat 100% healthy\u2026but then that goes too far and you end up eating something in the middle like a lean cuisine. Then you go to the store and the lean cuisines aren't on sale\u2026they're too expensive you didn't get paid that week, so now you have another competing interest: cost efficiency\u2026I'm going to eat this week in the CHEAPEST way possible. I don't know\u2026for me it's less confusing to think about it this way than to try to fathom these large cultural shifts with it.\u00a0\nBut as you can see in that example\u2026the process doesn't stop with meeting in the middle\u2026because then another Socrates comes along\u2026and another Socrates. Figuratively speaking there is always another Socrates that is going to come along. That \"synthesis\" that is arrived at, figuratively speaking is always going to be challenged by the NEXT Socrates. Hegel talks about how, sure there may have been some sort of paradigm shift towards a more individual approach to existence at that point, and that throughout the years\u2026this individualism grew and contorted and shift due to these conflicting interests\u2026he talks about how the French Revolution, and just that age of revolutions between these countries in general\u2026how it makes sense to think that that might just be when this individualism ran a muck. when this individualism pendulum swung too far!\nSchopenhauer has a quote: All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.\nThe root of what Hegel's saying here is this: as human beings that are trying to figure this world out\u2026were trying to find out the way that things are so we can make a difference or at least find out what the problems are that are facing us\u2026Hegel says that usually what we do is analyze the way that the world is RIGHT NOW. We run experiments, we figure out how things are right this instant, and we write books about how the world is.\u00a0\nAnd this intuitively makes sense\u2026I mean seems like a good place to start. But what Hegel is saying is that maybe in the same way we don't have some fixed moral human nature like the one Kant was pointing at\u2026.maybe the world, is too complex and under the influence of outside interests that it can't be reduced down into that way of thinking.\nMaybe understanding the world, can come only when you acknowledge the fact that it is CONSTANTLY changing. And Hegel says maybe a better tactic at getting to the bottom of this stuff is not trying to understand how things are right this instant, because by the time you've understood them\u2026they've already changed into something else\u2026maybe the key to understanding it is understanding that process\u2026that process of constant change.\u00a0\nYou know I'd compare it to trying to do an analysis of a very slowly moving target. You can go up to the target, measure the dimensions, find out what material it's made out of, write down what color it is, record what shape it is, carbon date the thing\u2026everything. And you might go back to your workstation and write an entire book about this target, telling the world about your findings and it may be the most illuminating account of that moving target that has ever been written.\u00a0\nBut what Hegel would say, is that target has moved since you last saw it. You may have done so much research that you can look at the target and it hasn't moved that much so it seems like you still know a lot about it, but eventually it will have changed to something completely different. What Hegel's saying is: if we know that the world is this way, why haven't we ever tried to understand that process of change more?\u00a0\nIn other words\u2026 by understanding the process in which the world changes\u2026 we might be able to understand the process by which we can change it. But to Hegel, the implications of this are much further reaching than just being able to start a super PAC and change the world\u2026there are DEEP moral implications for him here as well!\nSee because the very first question you probably have for Hegel here is okay, everything is changing\u2026everything is moving\u2026where is it moving to? You said everything was moving\u2026where is it all going?\nIs it random? Is the world and everyone in it for that matter really just randomly meandering around at the mercy of these competing interests that we have little to no control over? Hegel would probably say well we may be meandering\u2026and many of us may be at the mercy of them\u2026but one things for certain\u2026it isn't random. We're going somewhere. And the ultimate destination were going for is \"minds total understanding of itself\" and THAT to Hegel is almost synonymous to total understanding of freedom. All of these changes throughout history have ultimately been heading towards that.\nBut hold on\u2026this is yet another really interesting position that Hegel's taking\u2026and it's far from a given. How in the world\u2026is total self knowledge\u2026practically synonymous to freedom for Hegel? How is that even possible? The two don't SEEM like they're the same.\u00a0\nWell think about it from Hegel's perspective. What is an average person like? Most people don't go around aware of any of this stuff consciously. They don't go through life actively trying to figure out which of their values are really just conditioned into them because of their particular culture and time period. No, just like the people from Athens in 400 BC in Hegel's example\u2026these people don't go around thinking that something was WRONG with their approach to morality\u2026and in that sense\u2026 Think of what that means!\u00a0\nYou only have access to the ideas that are around you in YOUR CULTURE AND TIME PERIOD. They didn't have the luxury of living in a post Socrates world\u2026So in a weird way, they never had the OPTION to adopt a more individual approach to morality. It was IMPOSSIBLE for them to. I'm not saying the laws of physics were preventing them from ever arriving at a different conclusion, but given the tools that they had\u2026effectively it is impossible, because they would never feel the need to question any of this stuff\u2026because they didn't think it was wrong!\nWhat Hegel's asking is: is this total freedom? Or is this you just living your life in a really big cage that you never see the bars of?\nYou know it's easy to look back and denounce people that owned slaves in the 16 and 1700's. How many of those people were just kinda\u2026going along with whatever was socially acceptable during their culture and time period? How many of those people\u2026it's not that they were some evil dude twirling their mustache\u2026it was acceptable back then, so they never questioned it?\nI've said this on the show multiple times\u2026look around you. How many things that we just take for granted\u2026100 years from now\u2026people will look at us like we look at the slave owner from the 1700s? The interesting thing is\u2026they're there. We are constantly in a state of change to Hegel, so it is inevitable these things are all around us\u2026 most of us just cant see them because\u2026much like the slave owner\u2026it's socially acceptable so why question it?\nThink of the implications of this. How many beliefs do you hold right now\u2026even down to things that you think make you a special, unique person\u2026how many of these things are just things that have been conditioned into you, and you're not a bad person for having them\u2026it's an inescapable part of life\u2026what Hegel would say is: shouldn't we at least be aware.. that that's the world that we're living in? That that's where those values come from? In other words..if we don't understand WHY we hold the beliefs we do, can we really be said to be totally free? This is the connection of total self knowledge with freedom.\u00a0\nTo be totally free, to Hegel\u2026it's not enough to just go through life passively and let this constant process of change dictate everything we do and never question it. We need to UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS of historical change. Understand that we exist in a constantly moving target, and by understanding that the process of change is ultimately heading to a great place, you feel a sense of calm. Peace. Because\u2026even if in the short term something seems to be contrary to what you value\u2026you ultimately see everything for what it actually is\u2026one brick in a long road towards total freedom. Nothing is contrary to your interests at that point.\u00a0\nTruly understanding and accepting this fact is a state of total knowledge\u2026 and at that point\u2026Hegel says\u2026it's tough to get mad about anything\u2026all the things we took as hostile and exterior to ourselves before are actually a part of us\u2026a part of the process of change towards total freedom.\u00a0\nEvery nation, every government, yes even every cable news anchor\u2026has been a part of this process of change. Hegel truly thought that\u2026by writing these things down\u2026he was GIVING the world total self knowledge. In the same way the people in Athens didn't have the luxury of living in a post-Socratic world\u2026lucky us\u2026we have the luxury of living in a post Hegelian world. We have ACCESS to this stuff.\u00a0\nAnd in a way\u2026the big question at the root here\u2026the one that I started the other Hegel episodes with\u2026one that is very closely attached to ALL of this stuff that Hegel's talking about\u2026is what is freedom?\u00a0\nSee because a traditional definition of freedom\u2026we've all heard that before. What do I want in life? I wanna be happy. What would make me happy? No restrictions\u2026freedom to do anything I want anytime I want\u2026if I want to jump on a plane and go see my dying grandma\u2026i want to be able to do it\u2026if i want a day off of work\u2026I want to be able to not work. Sure money doesn't buy happiness, but money is freedom in paper form. Freedom\u2026is just being able to do anything you want to do without restrictions.\nBut Hegel's making the argument\u2026like many of his contemporaries\u2026but its his work ON this question went on to be incredibly influential\u2026is that enough to be considered TRULY free? And that\u2026just like WE might be conditioned to have the values and beliefs we have and that part of being TOTALLY free is understanding WHY we have the values we do\u2026not just blindly going along with them\u2026part of being TOTALLY free in other areas is not just being able to do what you want to do\u2026it's understanding WHY you're doing what you're doing. It's that self-awareness of what it means to be human that is liberating.\u00a0\nYou could sit on the couch all day long and watch TV and see the same burger king commercial over and over and over again\u2026subliminal messages\u2026weird evil George Bush mind control tactics constantly digging their way into your brain\u2026and when you got up and felt hungry\u2026it might feel like a COMPLETELY autonomous, free choice to decide that you're going to go down to burger king and get a cheeseburger\u2026but unless if you're aware of the fact that that's the reason WHY you're going to burger king as opposed to the countless other options you have\u2026you are enslaved to a certain extent\u2026your behavior is being controlled. Hegel's asking, can we be said to be truly free if that's the case?\nThis is the million dollar question. His work on this question was the idea\u2026the seed that was planted that eventually went on to affect Marx and countless other thinkers. Because a big thing that arises naturally from this discussion\u2026which we're going to continue to expand upon\u2026is another question. Given how at the mercy of all of these competing interests we are\u2026and given how easy it is to insulate yourself away from all the options out there\u2026with ANY choice you're making\u2026 and just do your best to stay comfortable with what ever you've already been exposed to\u2026maybe\u2026although we THINK we know what we want and what would make us the most happy\u2026maybe we aren't the best ones to decide what we should be doing\u2026what career we should have\u2026what marriage we should enter into\u2026and yes\u2026even what cheeseburger to eat.\u00a0\nThank you for listening\u2026ill talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_61": {"date": "2016-1-6", "text": "Posted on January 6, 2016\nEpisode 76 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #076\u00a0on Hegel. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nFor the next thirty minutes or so of your life, try to forget everything you know about God. Well, everything you believe you know about God. See when I say the word God\u2026its a very loaded term isn't it? Consider the fact that every single person listening to this\u2026when I say the word god\u2026you have your own personal vision of what that is\u2026you picture something slightly different\u2026.than everyone else out there. \u00a0\nYou know we've talked about this on the show before\u2026this seems to be an inescapable aspect of human language. Fact is these things we use called nouns, adjective and verbs\u2026these things are just\u2026 not descriptive enough\u2026 to plant the EXACT SAME IMAGE in my head and your head\u2026two different people's minds that come from different childhoods, different experiences.\u00a0\nPhilosophers have tried to fix this problem in the past, but the reality is at least right now as you're hearing this podcast\u2026when I say the word\u2026microphone\u2026each and every one of you pictures a slightly different microphone in your head. You might picture a black oblong one, she might picture a pink sparkly one, the point is\u2026the MICROPHONE that you picture\u2026 isn't pre-programmed into you by something\u2026all it is is the byproduct of some process going on in your head\u2026its just the sum total of all the experiences you've had with microphones filtered through your mental faculties to determine what \"microphone\" is. Well, the word God, is just another example of one of these words. \u00a0\nBased on all the experiences..the conditioning you've received from the people around you up until the moment you decided to listen to this episode\u2026you have an acquired definition\u2026an expectation of what I mean when I say the word God. But for the episode today\u2026let's try to forget all that. Let's do a thought experiment. Let's go deep down into the dark recesses of our brains and let's find that exact folder in our hard drive where that definition of God is\u2026and lets just delete it for the episode today.\u00a0\nZero expectations. What I'm asking you to do is to pretend as though you're a child again. Pretend as though you had never even heard the term God before\u2026there's nothing you think you know about God that must be true\u2026see because when you're a child\u2026before you ask your mom and dad\u2026what is God?\u2026and they begin that conditioning about what it is\u2026there's no inclination you have in ANY direction about what God must be\u2026God could be any number of things\u2026it could be a piece of paper. It could be..that fuzzy red stuffed animal you want at the arcade\u2026it could be the all powerful creator of that stuffed animal that knows you by your first name and WILLED for you to GET that stuffed animal when you played game with the claw that never works.\u00a0\nTo put yourself in the shoes of a child that doesn't have this conditioning in them yet is an extremely useful thing to do for a number of reasons\u2026and these reasons extend far beyond philosophy\u2026it can help you get a new perspective on your life\u2026it can help you understand anything that's difficult to understand\u2026but it's also extremely important for the episode today because as I was re-reading Hegel over the last month and a half I came across a section of Hegel where he talks about a possible option of what god is\u2026and it sort of reinvigorated me. I felt as though I had been put in the microwave for 30 seconds\u2026I was refreshed. Continued my research on it, found a few great articles and I decided you know what\u2026this just needs to be talked about. Hegel does a great job at doing everything that's great about this show\u2026not the least of which is that he spends a large portion of time before he even MENTIONS anything about this possible God\u2026trying to get us to question all of the assumptions that we have about what God must be.\u00a0\nYou know ever since the rise of this new atheist movement in the early 2000's\u2026its very easy\u2026especially for young people i've found or just people that are new to this process of questioning the nature of existence\u2026it's easy to think of our beliefs or lack of a belief about God as just one point on a giant line graph between two extremes that are actually a false dichotomy\u2026you know you can either be a fundamentalist follower of religion\u2026God created the world in seven days! A man loaded up two of each animal onto a boat\u2026or on the other hand you can be a science loving, occasional skeptic that proportions your beliefs to the evidence. Its conventional wisdom that these two extremes, unfortunately, are just the \"God landscape\" that we were born into.\u00a0\nBut as people that like to think about this stuff more than the average person\u2026we of course know that this is a cartoonish representation of either side\u2026it's no where NEAR this simple. We don't live in some NEW world where these are the only two ideas that are intellectually respected. You know just the name New Atheism implies that there was an Old Atheism before it.\u00a0\nWhen Richard Dawkins writes the God delusion\u2026or when Sam Harris writes the end of faith\u2026neither of these guys would say that these are new ideas theyre presenting. Atheisms been around for thousands of years\u2026democritus, epicurus, lucretious\u2026we've talked about them before. I see this in emails all the time\u2026Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins aren't philosophers\u2026where their genius lies is in being able to package together these ideas that already existed and write them in a way that resonates with the culture in the early 2000's\u2026a very unique time in history where it's actually possible to package together these ideas without being drawn and quartered.\nThese are not new ideas that rattled the foundations of thinking where now we only have one of two options. \u00a0\nBut we can at least be sympathetic of the fact of how someone new to these discussions might look around them and feel like they live in this world. These two groups ARE very vocal. We certainly SEE them the most. And there certainly IS a divide between the two of them\u2026A divide that we've been led to believe is irreconcilable. Theologians ever since Darwin have been trying to find a way to reconcile the differences between what seems reasonable to believe based on scientific experiments with the clear inconsistencies in any of these religious texts. It's proven to be a pretty difficult thing to do.\u00a0\nNow, some people claim that they've done it, but there are always problems\u2026always questions left to be answered. And because there is no knockdown argument for this\u2026it becomes really easy to believe that you either have to believe in one or the other\u2026fundamentalist religion\u2026or the scientific narrative.\u00a0\nBut Hegel would say\u2026throw all of this out the window. Forget this debate that you're having\u2026forget what you THINK you know about God because this idea that you have that these two viewpoints are talking about two separate things is and they're not both talking about the SAME thing\u2026 ultimately that's founded in a giant assumption you're making about what God must look like.\u00a0\nHegel spends page after page pointing out all the problems with the way that people typically think about God. He says\u2026you know\u2026most people\u2026 you ask them if they believe in god\u2026and they say yes\u2026you ask them OK, so what does that God look like? Hegel says, most people, and i think this is pretty accurate\u2026most people say they believe in something that is an omniscient, omnipotent being that is good and just and all that other stuff\u2026Hegel thinks this is ridiculous. He thinks its an oversimplification. He thinks it's unsurprisingly transparent that this is the sort of conception of God that is usually arrived at by people that don't think about God that much. You know, either they are too quick to dismiss the idea of a God existing out of insecurity or they just went to church when they were seven and were told what to believe. Hegel says this for a few different reasons\u2026he starts out by saying that if this is the sort of definition of what God is that you subscribe to\u2026forget about omniscience or omnipotence\u2026forget about all these personality traits you're trying to tack onto that God\u2026one big mistake that you're making if that's the way that you think about God is that you're assuming God is a \"being\" at all.\n\u00a0God is not a being to Hegel. God can't be a being. To be a being\u2026in a world where we describe OURSELVES as beings\u2026you know we call ourselves human beings\u2026a lot of people think of themselves as spiritual beings having some sort of contact with this God we're talking about\u2026God can't be a being in that universe because if it was\u2026it would be limited. One things for certain, if this archetype we refer to as God exists\u2026it must be something infinite. It must be by its very nature something that is unlimited. To be a being in a universe filled with beings\u2026is to be limited at least in some small way. After all, I'm not god. You're not god. When your dog has an accident on the floor\u2026your dog did not excrete a piece of God onto the floor. To be a being is to be finite. God isn't finite. So in this way, Hegel says God can't be a being\u2026if it exists\u2026whatever it is\u2026it must be something greater than a being.\u00a0\nThis probably reminds you of Maimonides and many of the subject matters of the episodes we did closer to the Middle Ages. You know\u2026this eternal question\u2026can faith and reason co-exist. Can reason justify the existence of a God and if it can, what does reason dictate\u2026what can we infer ABOUT that God if it in fact exists.\u00a0\nHegel thinks we're so quick to make these sweeping inferences about what this God must be like\u2026so often we think about this God as just a bigger\u2026stronger back lit version of a human being that can do all sorts of cool magic tricks\u2026when in reality\u2026Hegel thinks\u2026God isn't anything like that. God isn't a wish granter. God didn't write his magnum opus on some clay tablets\u2026god doesn't have a personalized plan for you\u2026God\u2026to Hegel\u2026 is just the process of self-determination imbued into the cosmos.\u00a0\nNow what does Hegel mean by this? Well\u2026he thinks\u2026at least he seems to think\u2026that understanding what he's referring to as \"God\" here is the easiest by looking at what we are in relation to God. He breaks it down like this: Hegel doesn't think that most of us are real. Not\u2026in a physical sense. Like, of course you could have a scientist come down to your house\u2026put on their goggles and run an experiment on you and it would be pretty clear you're real in an empirical sense.\u00a0\nBut just like last episode when we talked about freedom being practically synonymous to total self knowledge and how you're not completely free unless you understand WHY you do what you do\u2026in a sense\u2026when we realize one of these ways that we're being controlled by the stuff around us and not by ourselves\u2026Hegel says that in a small way we are more REAL than we were before\u2026now\u2026we're more self-determining as opposed to being a subject in this dictatorship of outside influencers\u2026.from advertising, to cultural shifts anything. The point that Hegel's making is: something that makes itself what it is\u2026is more fully real\u2026than something MADE by something else\u2026and constantly DEPENDENT on something else.\n\nWhen we get past these barriers of trying to simplify the world\u2026when we transcend that cultural slavery\u2026that conditioning\u2026those shackles that we're born into\u2026shackles that by default would drastically affect what we do without us even realizing it\u2026when we engage in this sort of open-minded discussion with ourselves about why we think and believe what we do\u2026we are to Hegel\u2026more real in those moments than in others because we are more self-determined. We are making ourselves what we are, instead of being at the mercy of something else.\u00a0\nSo Hegel's saying, how about this idea: God isn some Gandalf looking guy up in the sky that's mad at everyone. God isn't some finite being with a plan for everyone\u2026no what if God was just the process of self-determination\u2026and if you think about it\u2026in keeping with what we talked about on the last Hegel episode\u2026wouldn't that also make god the truest reality?\nNow what makes this such a profound thing is that\u2026this is the connection! In a world where people believe in a God for the sake of spiritual growth\u2026in a world where people feel gratified because they believe in something greater than themselves and they're told that there is no way to have that spiritual tool available to you unless if you're willing to be in direct opposition to the current scientific narrative\u2026here's Hegel talking about a God where it seems like that doesn't necessarily need to be the case. Both can be true.\u00a0\nAfter all, if God isn't a being\u2026if God is just whatever is most fully real\u2026well\u2026that sounds a lot like the chief objective of science right? To use induction and falsifiable experiments to arrive at an increasingly more accurate version of what reality is, not our superstitious assumptions. And for the person that doesn't really care about that and just sees God as a catalyst for personal development, what an incredible virtue to strive for\u2026pure self determination without being unknowingly controlled by outside forces?\nNow I have a secret\u2026I can see the future. I can see the emails coming in now and I know that one recurring one i'm going to be getting is this and I might as well address it now. You know it's funny\u2026I don't think I'm going to get much email disagreement from people who are fundamentalists. Honestly, Hegel is saying God exists\u2026that corresponds with something they already believe\u2026most of them will probably just try to find a way to find SIMILARITIES between what they believe and Hegel believes.\u00a0\nThe people that are going to be up in arms about this episode are people that probably don't believe in god\u2026they probably pride themselves on being a skeptic and they probably are saying, well Hegel certainly hasn't PROVEN the existence of God here and really all he did was just switch the definition of God to something else less controversial. But couldn't you do that with anything? Couldn't I just Personally define God as\u2026my car? And then go outside point at my car and say oh look! God exists!\nHegel would no doubt look at that person and say: look at you. there is nothing else you could have said right there that more obviously shows the biases that you're bringing to this discussion about God, biases conditioned into you by the current discussion going on during your lifetime. The notion that God is this omniscient omnipotent being that knows you by your first name was NEVER on the table. That wasn't even what we were discussing. I think Hegel would be confused at first but then I think he'd feel like what was really happening here, something else he talks about\u2026is that this person is blindly vitriolic to the word \"God\" being used at all, no matter what it looks like just because of the history that is connected to the word.\u00a0\nAnd on one level it's understandable, but I think what Hegel would say\u2026is that if every time you hear the word God you instantly raise your eyebrows or scoff or find some way to dismiss the conversation on the grounds that it's outlandish\u2026you are not someone interested in finding the truth\u2026you're someone interested in reinforcing what you already feel is true.\u00a0\nThink about it: why is the word God a taboo thing to say? Why is this archetype of some sort of creative mechanism or thing that sustains the laws of the universe or whatever it is\u2026why is that an idea that we should be instantly dismissive of, if we in fact want to know the truth? Shouldn't we leave room for it to be a possibility? Imagine a world where we know a lot more about the universe than we do now but there's still some really big mysteries out there\u2026What if allowing for the possibility of that philosophical archetype of a God existing was the missing link between total understanding of the universe and living in ignorance? Shouldn't we at least entertain the idea of there being a timeless, infinite, incorporeal thing that's responsible for certain constants in the universe?\u00a0\nAnd really, aside from how allowing for the possibility of a God might get us closer to truth about reality, for this person potentially sending in this email, there's a very real self-interested motivation you have for not instantly dismissing the idea of a God every time it's brought up. Because BY dismissing it, you are essentially allowing the people you're fighting against to hijack the word God and conflate the possible notion of a God existing with their cause.\nHere's what I mean. It's actually really similar to something we've already talked about in the belief episode\u2026the question of when it's appropriate to make a faith based assertion about something.\u00a0\nSee it's really tempting to look at your Facebook wall\u2026see someone say something about how this baby was saved from this harrowing, fiery car wreck, see one of your friends say\u2026\u2026God is good\u2026glory to god for saving this child\u2026its very easy to sit there and say\u2026oh well they believe that based on faith. problem with that is that its completely unverifiable\u2026unlike me who believes in things based on the evidence. I believe in cold hard facts, if there's not evidence to support it\u2026I don't believe it.\u00a0\nIt's easy to mistakenly think that faith is belief without evidence\u2026when in reality faith is belief without SUFFICIENT evidence. A fundamentalist baptist from Mississippi may have initially just DECIDED to believe in God when they were a kid, but they look around them and they point to what they see as \"evidence\" of God's obvious existence. The beauty of nature, coincidences, feelings of bliss they have when praying\u2026they point to these empirical phenomena as EVIDENCE garnered in their own personal experiments\u2026that God exists. Evidence is all over the place\u2026the really interesting question that remains is\u2026what is SUFFICIENT evidence?\nWhat is sufficient evidence to claim to KNOW something? Because this same person writing this email, hostile towards the idea of God the moment they hear the word\u2026they'd no doubt acknowledge that\u2026what we think we know in the year 2015 based on scientific experiments is by no means infallible\u2026its just the best thing we have. No doubt in 100 years most things we think we know now are going to be completely disproved\u2026that's kind of whats great about science\u2026it's the furthest thing from dogmatic\u2026it always is improving upon itself.\nSo knowing that\u2026even if science IS the best thing we have right now\u2026is it sufficient evidence to claim to know that something is true? Or is it just BETTER than arbitrarily DECIDING to believe in something? Make no mistake\u2026as we talked about in the belief episode\u2026it is a currently inescapable aspect of human existence that every belief we hold\u2026no matter what evidence we cite for WHY it's true\u2026every belief is a leap of faith at some level, but not all leaps of faith are created equal.\u00a0\nAnd THAT'S the key distinction. Because in the same way someone might instantly dismiss the idea of a God existing as soon as they hear the word\u2026my point is\u2026people also do this with the word faith right?\u00a0\nTo the person writing this email\u2026if you rail against the idea of faith based beliefs altogether\u2026not only is it incredibly insecure\u2026but you're also allowing your opposition to hijack the word \"faith\" and then align any merit connected to faith with their cause.\u00a0\nLet me give an example\u2026somebody might make the point that we are human beings\u2026we have very flawed senses, brains designed to pick bananas, a very narrow lens to view the universe through\u2026and there is no guarantee based on those limitations that every aspect of reality is knowable to us. Maybe, to avoid going completely insane\u2026it's beneficial to believe in some things based on faith because there currently is no way for us to know some things beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nI got news for you\u2026that is a totally reasonable point. This is a great argument for why it may be necessary to believe in things based on faith. Now if you're someone that hears the word \"faith\", cringes and says no I don't believe in things based on faith\u2026I believe in cold hard facts based on evidence. You're allowing the other side to align their beliefs, no matter what they are, with the merits of faith\u2026when in reality, ironically, every belief you HOLD is based on a leap of faith\u2026and the TRULY productive conversation begins when you ADMIT that fact and say, OK we both believe in what we do based on a leap of faith, now explain to me how yours is justified.\u00a0\nWhat I'm saying is\u2026in the same way it is beneficial to not let any group hijack the word \"faith\" and align in with their cause\u2026the same thing is true about the word \"God\". By not being vitriolic towards the idea of a God exists\u2026you're not giving up\u2026you're not saying that talking snakes are real\u2026what you're saying is that you're willing to be honest about what is possible. Now, similar to the faith conversation, now the onus is on THEM to justify why their individual conception of God is justified. And if I'm just giving advice to a fellow thinker\u2026THAT is where you will win the argument. THAT is where they wont be able to hide behind GENERAL arguments about why the possibility of a God existing is reasonable, and they'll be forced to verify the specifics about what they're saying.\nThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_62": {"date": "2016-1-16", "text": "Posted on January 16, 2016\nEpisode 77 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #077\u00a0on Marx. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo when I was but a wee lad I used to read quite a bit of fiction books. Don't really read much fiction anymore, but it used to be 100% of what I read\u2026learned a lot of lessons from those books\u2026started out with Goosebumps\u2026sort of graduated to the Hardy Boys franchise\u2026and after that I started reading Mark Twain. Read all of the classics\u2026sort of exalted Mark Twain in my head as a quasi deity. Would read quotes by him. Saw him as this beacon of wit that was unparalleled. But then around three years ago I was surfin' the Youtubes and I came across this video of him. Yeah, a video\u2026Thomas Edison had a camera and they took it and just made this horrible quality, black and white video of Mark Twain staring at the camera like he'd never seen a camera before.\u00a0\nThey get this long, suspense building shot of him walking along the side of his house\u2026it was really simple. And it was weird, when I saw this video all of a sudden this guy that I had formerly exalted in my head as the God of wit in my pantheon of Gods, all of a sudden he was just a person. An old dude smoking a cigar on his front porch. He became more real to me.\u00a0\nWell over the years on this show we've talked about a lot of philosophers from all different kinds of backgrounds. We've talked about reclusive philosophers\u2026aggressive philosophers\u2026we've talked about slaves turned philosopher\u2026philosopher kings. But something happens right around the mid to late 1800's\u2026the invention of the camera starts to become more prevalent. It starts to become common place that if you're a notable figure making waves in the world\u2026chances are someones gonna want to take a picture of you.\u00a0\nWhat I\u2019m saying is\u2026something changes when you can look into the eyes of these philosophers. Not a sculpture of them, not a likeness painted over a fireplace\u2026but an actual moment frozen in time. This is them. This is who they were at one point in time. What happens I think is\u2026they become people rather than enigmas.\u00a0\nSocrates was an enigma, it seems sometimes like he was more of an idea than a person, he stood for a clear cause, he died for that cause, his reputation lives on throughout history\u2026and because of that\u2026there's something magical about Socrates. There\u2019s something magical about other people from history that are similar to Socrates. And it\u2019s a magic that\u2019s only made possible when there's no objective proof this person even existed. Maybe it's because I live in an age where everyone has a camera in their back pocket, but seeing a picture of Karl Marx, on one hand\u2026it instantly takes that magic away for me\u2026but it makes something else possible that Socrates could never give me.\u00a0\nWhen you look into the eyes of Karl Marx, when you look at photographs of the very people living alongside him that he looked into the eyes of\u2026seeing them as people that were in pain and oppressed\u2026how he dedicated his entire life to trying to find a system that he thought would bring an end to that pain\u2026what happens with Karl Marx is\u2026you can start to relate to him not as this enigma that embodies communist thinking like many people do, but as a person. A philosopher by day and a thumpin' good one at that.\u00a0\nBut this episode isn't about communism. We got a lot more episodes on Marx to do, we'll cover it there. This episode is about those people that we just talked about\u2026those people living during Marx\u2019s time that you can see photographs of and why Marx thought they were being oppressed. This is part one of a two part episode on Marx and Kierkegaard's views on religion and how differently they looked at it. Now you may be asking, why do an episode on religion, why not cover their views on religion as a part of the rest of the episodes you\u2019re dedicating to them. Well, I think these episodes are going to help us understand the rest of their thinking a lot better. See if we can understand how these guys viewed the plight of the average person living during their time period, it\u2019ll give us some great context that will bring clarity to the more nuanced aspects of their thinking.\u00a0\nTo understand Marx, and how HE views the purpose of religion, the best place to probably start is to give you a little bit of a background on where Marx is coming from. Marx is living in a world where the full affects of the industrial revolution are being felt. All of the thinking of just a few generations ago\u2026the economics of Adam Smith, the improvements in government by Hobbes Locke and Rousseau, ALL of these things have been in affect long enough to start paying dividends. These dividends include\u2026economic prosperity. Now, during this time, if you're living in Europe, you aren't just limited to trading with your immediate neighboring countries like you were in the past\u2026brand new, unprecedented opportunities are starting to become available to you\u2026now you have this unprecedented ability to cross the pacific ocean and trade with the united states\u2026now you have this unprecedented ability to trade with India and many parts of Asia\u2026\u00a0\nMarx talks about how what happened as a result of this is that\u2026because you have more and more people that you're able to trade with, the demand for whatever you produce becomes greater and greater and you have to find a way of making EVEN MORE of what you already were making. So in that sort of economic climate\u2026in this climate of ever-increasing demand\u2026if you're just an individual artisan or craftsman\u2026you cant survive. Whatever it is you're making\u2026if you're whittling figurines out of a piece of driftwood\u2026you can only whittle so fast! Now instead of whittling for 8 countries you gotta whittle for 20 countries 30 countries. its impossible to keep up!\nMarx says that the people that DO survive in that environment are not the craftsmen\u2026but the manufacturers\u2026the people that have the means to mass produce stuff. The problem with this Marx says, is that instead of trade and the economy being in the hands of thousands of craftsmen, now it's in the hands of a very small handful of manufacturers, that in turn have an inordinate amount of control over the lives of the average citizen. Now, this in itself would be enough of a problem to deal with, but Marx sees this as a HORRIBLE thing that\u2019s going on\u2026one that needs to be stopped immediately\u2026because he looks back at various points throughout history and says, man\u2026I\u2019ve seen this before haven\u2019t I?\u00a0\nMarx is the most famous follower of Hegel's thinking we have and one of the things Marx centers his philosophy around the most is Hegel's dialectic. Remember, Hegel thought that understanding the world is not understanding something that is fixed and static. No, the world is constantly changing and shifting and that in the same way understanding a moving target comes down to understanding the rate and nature of the way that it's moving, maybe a better strategy for people trying to understand the world is to understand that underlying process of change.\u00a0\nHegel arrives at what he calls \"the dialectic\"\u2026the three part process of conflicting interests butting heads that leads to any change in the world. The thesis, the way that things are, the antithesis, the conflicting interest, and the synthesis, the result of the conflict between the two and the new order of things. That synthesis becomes the new thesis and so on and so forth.\u00a0\nMarx liked this idea. He liked it a lot. So what he does is he takes Hegel's dialectic and applies it to one of his favorite areas to think about: the economic history of the world. What he concludes is that quote\n\u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\u201d\nWhat he means by this is that if you look back at history, from an economic perspective it\u2019s all pretty much been the same to Marx. As far as he can tell there\u2019s always two major classes of people. There\u2019s always a ruling class of people, these are the people that have control over the economy, and an exploited class of people, people that are exploited by that ruling class. Marx would want us to apply Hegel\u2019s dialectic to the process of economic change in the world. He says think of the ruling class of people as the thesis and the exploited class of people as the antithesis. Eventually, what always happens, is the exploited class of people get tired of being exploited, there\u2019s some sort of revolution, the ruling class is overthrown and a new world emerges, the synthesis, but then there's a new ruling class that is then in turn exploiting a class of people who eventually revolt and this process, this dialectical process of change just repeats itself over and over again.\nMarx gives all kinds of examples from history of what he\u2019s talking about\u2026we can think of some. You know if you\u2019re living in colonial america in the 16, 17, 1800\u2019s\u2026you are either a slave, a member of an exploited class of people, no freedom, or you are a slave master, or at least a free person with the potential to be a slave master. What eventually happened? Enough people got tired of there being this exploited class of people and a revolution occurred.\u00a0\nGo back to the middle ages when the feudal system is in style. In that world you\u2019re either a landowner\u2026 you\u2019re a member of the ruling class you know king, aristocrat, or guild\u2026 or you\u2019re part of the peasantry, you\u2019re someone working the land\u2026 a member of the exploited class. What eventually happened? People got tired of being the exploited class and peasant revolts started happening everywhere.\u00a0\nMarx is saying that this new economic climate during his time\u2026 of trade being controlled by a handful of manufacturers, what he calls the bourgeoisie worsens the dynamic between them, the ruling class and what he called the proletariat, or the people now beholden to the bourgeoisie.\u00a0\nBy the way. Marx would no doubt look at our lives\u2026 as modern workers in a capitalist western society and he would see us\u2026 as the exploited class of this time period. Now this raises the question\u2026well if we\u2019re the exploited class\u2026who are the ruling class? Well there\u2019s a few answers to this question\u2026maybe the big financial institutions that control most of the capital. Maybe big companies that control most of the production, whatever you or Marx would think the answer to this question is, one thing is certain to him, we\u2026the people listening to this show\u2026 definitely are all members of the exploited class of this age.\u00a0\nNow you may hear that and say, well that\u2019s funny\u2026I don\u2019t feel exploited. I go to work, I love my job, I get paid well, I have a family, I never go without food or water or shelter, I got two vacations a year!! Where\u2019s the exploitation in that? I LOVE my life.\u00a0\nSee, exploitation just sounds like such a dirty word, doesn\u2019t it? You think exploitation and you think of someone holding you down punching you in the face. You think of them treating you like an animal where your life is abject misery. What Marx would say is that just because you don\u2019t FEEL like you\u2019re being exploited, doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re NOT being exploited. Just because you\u2019ve grown fond of the chains that you\u2019ve had around your legs since birth, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not there.\u00a0\nYou may love your job. You may get 50,000 dollars a year to do something rewarding for you. But one thing is entirely clear, you are making that company you work for a LOT more than 50,000 dollars to do the stuff that you do for them every year, if you didn\u2019t it wouldn't be very profitable for them to pay you 50,000 dollars to do it. So in the sense\u2026 that they\u2019re paying you not what you\u2019re actually worth, but what you expect\u2026in that sense, you are being exploited for your labor.\u00a0\nYou may think its in your self interest to work for them, that job may help you realize every dream you have throughout your life, you may never feel like you're EVER going without at any point in your life, the point that Marx is making here is a broader one. Why does the system NEED to be this way? Why does the system NEED to have this dynamic of one party getting rich\u2026 off of other parties being paid less than they\u2019re producing?\u00a0\nAnd if we realize that this is the case\u2026why would we be satisfied with that arrangement? Forget human rights or anything like that\u2026Marx points out\u2026think about it\u2026look at history\u2026what ALWAYS happens when that dynamic exists? There\u2019s a revolution! The exploited class, time after time, rises up and overthrows the ruling class! Often times with a lot of blood shed, often times with a lot of political strife and a period of time where the entire country vulnerable to attacks from other countries\u2026why should we just accept\u2026 that that\u2019s a natural part of this world we live in?\nIn other words, is it at least in theory possible\u2026to devise a system\u2026Where there is no ruling class and exploited class?\u00a0\nNow, if you\u2019re one of these people that is perfectly happy with your lot in life, you don\u2019t feel exploited\u2026Marx would say\u2026 well that\u2019s EXACTLY how the ruling class wants you to feel and that feelings probably been conditioned into you by an elaborate propaganda campaign to make you satisfied or distracted from the way that things are.\u00a0\nThink about it: put yourself in the shoes of someone in the ruling class. If you recognized that you\u2019re a member of this ruling class..and you saw the pattern throughout history of the inevitability of this exploited class causing a revolution\u2026what does your strategy become then? Well obviously to prolong the amount of time in between these revolutions as long as possible. You have to maximize the amount of time you can profit off of exploiting these people. Marx thinks historically, there's been a lot of different tactics the ruling class would use to do this.\u00a0\nThink of Rome\u2026Bread and circuses\u2026Gladiatorial games\u2026meant to appease and distract an under served population from political turmoil and deception. This stuff has happened in the past\u2026interesting thing to think about is\u2026is it happening today? Well, we may not have gladiators getting eaten by lions in today\u2019s world, but we can definitely see some possible parallels right? All of the food at everyone\u2019s disposal, we have video games, movies, sports games, the academy awards celebrities\u2026practically an endless sea of methods to distract yourself away from what is going on in the world politically and economically.\u00a0\nNow this may not be orchestrated by a cabal of people at the top that design the media this way for this purpose, but it certainly gives people that option right? You look at the numbers of people voting and the general aura of political apathy in the United States and you start to wonder if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u00a0\nBut Marx thinks, all these methods are child's play\u2026no..if you really want to distract people from whats going on\u2026 by far the most successful, effective and nefarious version of these methods of controlling behavior is\u2026religion. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard his famous quote: Religion, is the opiate of the masses, but what does he mean by that?\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not just saying religion is a drug that people take, think of specifically what an opiate is. When you're putting up Christmas lights and you fall off the roof and break your leg in four places and you get rushed to the hospital, what does the doctor give you? they give you morphine or some sort opiate so that you\u2019re not in excruciating pain and they can work on fixing it. Opiates mitigate and help you forget about\u2026pain.\u00a0\nThe pain of being exploited. Marx thinks that religion takes you out of this world and carries you off into a different world\u2026the same way video games or movies or a TV show might carry you off into a different world. But this is the ULTIMATE fantasy world to Marx\u2026it tells you that in this world\u2026no matter how bad you have it\u2026this is only a temporary existence\u2026you\u2019re just on the moral proving ground\u2026what your REAL focus should be is on otherworldly things! On heaven and eternity and paradise! You know, The sweet by and by if you\u2019re a slave in colonial America.\u00a0\nTake no thought for the morrow, don\u2019t worry about this mortal realm, God\u2019s got your back. I mean, the reason religion is such an effective tool at making people happier is the level of acceptance that it breeds about everything. No matter how bad things seem\u2026no matter how many horrible things happen to you in succession\u2026ultimately\u2026it was God\u2019s will. You have to accept it, who are you to question God\u2019s will? He\u2019s just making you into a better person by throwing adversity your way. Again, a terrific recipe for personal happiness\u2026not a very good recipe if you\u2019re Marx and you\u2019re trying to improve the world and do away with this ruling class for good.\u00a0\nThis is how Marx saw religion. Some guy or girl a long long time ago that was a little bit smarter than the people around them realized that if they just wrote down a story and got people to believe it, they could control them. This was such an effective tool they kept making revisions and additions\u2026religion 2.1 religion 2.2\u2026and eventually we arrived at a widely accepted story of prophecy and miracles and hope and that the ruling class has been using this story to economically oppress the exploited class all throughout human history.\u00a0\nAnd Marx would really hammer home the notion that isn\u2019t it so CONVENIENT that the religion that is popular during a certain time period always mirrors and justifies the economic structure of that time period. Really interesting point to consider. Let me give you a few examples of what he\u2019s talking about.\u00a0\nWhat is the economic and political structure during the feudal system, during that thousand year period in the Middle Ages? Well again, it\u2019s hierarchical. At the very top of the pyramid you have the King, underneath him you have the aristocrats, underneath them you have the guild, the three of these groups combined making up a very small percentage of the population, and then underneath them you have the peasantry. That\u2019s everyone else.\u00a0\nWell, what is the prominent form of religion in western Europe during this time? It\u2019s a specific type of Christianity that has evolved and shifted into what we now know as Catholicism. Now, what is the structure of Catholicism during that time? Oh well you have the Pope at the top. Underneath him you have cardinals and bishops, underneath them you have the priests, the three of these classes making up a very small percentage of Catholics, and then underneath them you have the laity. Again, that\u2019s everyone else.\u00a0\nMarx would say that not only is this transparently a mirror image of the feudal economic system that is designed to control people and keep them in the peasantry, the two appear to justify each other and seem to be working together: hence his claim that the ruling class using it as an opiate.\u00a0\nAfter all, if you\u2019re a peasant living at that time\u2026if this hierarchical structure that I see in church is God\u2019s will, no matter how much I don\u2019t like it, that must be the best way for a society to be run too\u2026not to mention the fact\u2026 whenever a new king comes to power, it\u2019s always the pope, acting on God\u2019s behalf that puts the crown on his head. To a peasant, God MUST endorse what\u2019s going on here. The structure of religion always mirrors\u2026 the current ECONOMIC tactic for coercion by the ruling class.\u00a0\nMarx would say, if you doubt this fact \u2026look at what happens next in history. As we move away from the 1000 years of the feudal system, as the peasant revolts put an end to it\u2026here comes capitalism replacing the feudal system. Now, here\u2019s a brand new economic system that has a very DIFFERENT way that people are organized, right?\u00a0\nSee, under feudalism\u2026there was a hierarchy\u2026things were class based\u2026and you are chained to that class for your entire life. Well, in capitalism it\u2019s different\u2026in capitalism people should be equal as opposed to being a member of a class\u2026in capitalism\u2026 liberty is a virtue, not being bound to a class for your whole life. Marx would say\u2026 how convenient\u2026 that right when the world started shifting into a more capitalist model, that's exactly when protestants start giving Catholics trouble and religion begins to reform into something that allows for 1) a level of liberty in interpreting the bible and 2) largely abandons the typical hierarchical structure of the clergy. Marx sees this as nothing more than religion adapting to its environment so that it can mirror and morally justify the capitalist system of economic exploitation.\u00a0\nHe see this and thinks it\u2019s clear: religion is a calculated political and economic tactic of keeping people passive, meek, and poor as a virtue.\u00a0\nMatthew 19:24 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u00a0\nThink of the message that sends. Yeah, you are overworked and exploited and barely scraping by and you look at other people that are profiting off of your labor and eventually\u2026its not unreasonable to think\u2026 you might begin to resent some of these people. Enough of this resentment builds up\u2026 and you might DO something about it.\u00a0\nBut then Marx would point out you bring that resentment to church on Sunday and you\u2019re told to turn the other cheek\u2026you\u2019re told to be grateful for what God has given you to accept the way that things are as God\u2019s will\u2026you\u2019re told that rich people go to hell\u2026don\u2019t envy that guy over there profiting off of your work\u2026feel BAD for him!\u00a0\nWell at the end of the church service\u2026all the pain you felt when you entered that church must be lifted from you. God\u2019s got my back. This existence is temporary. I don\u2019t feel so bad anymore. The same way you might be writhing in pain in a hospital bed, the doctor starts an IV of morphine and it brings you the same kind of relief.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not like everyone was this cynical about religion during Marx\u2019s time. Another brilliant thinker that thought very differently about all these things was a guy named Soren Kierkegaard. And we\u2019ll hear what he has to say about Marx on part 2 of this episode next time on Philosophize This! Thank you for listening. Ill talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_63": {"date": "2016-5-10", "text": "Posted on May 10, 2016\nEpisode 81 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #081\u00a0on Marx.

Let's get onto the program. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo let's all imagine something. Let's imagine that you're walking down the street with a camera and a microphone and you're interviewing just RANDOM people in an average city in the modern United States. You know just the first person you run into walking their dog down the street\u2026\u00a0\nStatistically speaking\u2026if you asked that person the question\u2026which do you think is a better economic system Capitalism or Communism\u2026you know pretend as though those are the only two options they have\u2026what do you think they'd say? Well I don't think it's a very controversial prediction to make that most Americans are going to say Capitalism. I was born into a Capitalist system. Look at all the prosperity it's afforded me and my family. Look at all of the innovations that have come as a result of capitalism. In Capitalism we have mansions in the\u00a0napa\u00a0valley\u2026in communism you have a refrigerator box\u2026in capitalism we have the super bowl\u2026in communism you have\u2026who can chase the rat underneath the dumpster the fastest and get dinner. \u00a0\nMaybe that's a little extreme\u2026but you know what's interesting? For several years of my adult life this is not that far from what I thought the differences were between the two. I don't think most Americans are given a fair representation of the criticisms Karl Marx had of capitalism\u2026I think largely people are sold this bill of goods that communism and socialism are profane words\u2026if somebody acknowledges anything about them that might be a good point\u2026it's tantamount to being unpatriotic or somehow a BAD American. BAD AMERICAN!\u00a0\nBut there's something else interesting about this. Around 20 years ago if you walked down that very same street and talked to the people then\u2026you'd be much more likely to find people that won't even ENTERTAIN the idea of socialism or communism. People that raise their eyebrows to someone even ASKING if we should consider something other than capitalism. But something's changed in these last 20-30 years hasn't it? \u00a0\nJust look at these numbers: we have Bernie Sanders\u2026self proclaimed socialist democrat not only capable of running for president, but ALSO giving Hilary Clinton a run for her money\u2026winning entire states! Gallup just came out with a poll a few days ago\u202635% of Americans view socialism in a positive light. That's a far cry from the way that things were not too long ago\u2026so what changed?\u00a0\nAnd a common answer to this question is that people are starting to see the very real flaws in a capitalist system and are looking to move onto something they think is better. But again, for years of my life I didn't know how you could even critique capitalism\u2026I thought it was case closed\u2026I thought the only people that had a problem with it were people that were lazy and just wanted the government to give them everything so they didn't have to work. Boy was I wrong when I first read Karl Marx several years ago. \u00a0\nNow, to be fair\u2026not everyone that's a proponent of capitalism is as naive as I was about it\u2026you know\u2026there's a good friend of the show on Twitter this week that referenced the quote Capitalism is the worst system, except for all the others. You know\u2026most people KNOW there are problems with capitalism\u2026they just see it as the best option we got. \u00a0\nNevertheless, whether we've refined a system better than capitalism in today's day or not\u2026whether the first iterations of Karl Marx's vision of communism went horribly wrong or not\u2026I don't think anyone would disagree with the value of looking at well thought out criticisms of the system we're currently in\u2026if for no other reason than to make it better. And THIS is the value of looking at the criticisms that Karl Marx had of capitalism\u2026many of which have not been addressed\u2026many of which possibly can not be addressed because they're built in systemically. \u00a0\nI guess one thing we all have to accept as honest human beings is that capitalism is not a perfect economic system\u2026and despite the fact we were born into it and see its effects around us all the time many of them we see as good, it is not the only way that things have ever been done. No there are many economic systems that have been tried\u2026and Marx as a philosopher taking a step back and analyzing them all next to each other would say\u2026 that each and every one of them have contradictions built into them that are probably the reason why they aren't still in use today. \u00a0\nHe called these competing forces built into these systems\u2026internal conflicts. The feudal system in the middle ages has certain internal conflicts that led to revolution. Slavery in the new world had certain internal conflicts that led to revolution. Marx is saying\u2026maybe capitalism does as well. Whats an example of one of these?\u2026well I don't want to get too tangential here so I'll try to keep it short\u2026we'll no doubt be talking about this again when we're talking about his critiques, but I really want us to understand the systemic nature of these internal conflicts that Marx is talking about and how to him they seem like unsolvable problems that will inevitably come to fruition no matter what we do\u2026they're built into the economic model. \u00a0\nOne thing that a Marxist might say is an internal conflict within capitalism is that capitalists, these people that control the means of production, owners of corporations mostly in our modern day are always looking to make more capital. That's kind of the whole thing there. Anyway, how do they get more capital? Well Marx would say a convenient place to look and one that is a huge expense to most high production, profitable entities is\u2026employee wages. Sometimes 30 to 40 percent of your total sales. \u00a0\nSo the capitalist responds to this and they make things more efficient, maybe introduces technology to take over certain jobs, lays people off and has less employees do the same work that more employees used to do, stagnates wages as profits increase\u2026not because they're bad people\u2026but because they're operating within an economic system where capital is the intrinsic good. \u00a0\nNow what happens Marx says is that\u2026naturally\u2026when you're paying less people less money\u2026capitalism begins to cannibalize itself\u2026these competing forces not only make it so that the employees\u2026the consumers of what the capitalist is producing have less money to actually buy what they're producing\u2026but it also insures that because of this intrinsic good of capital\u2026coupled with the inordinate amount of control that a handful of people have over the means of production\u2026it insures that without intervention the rich will always get richer and the poor will always get poorer in a capitalist system. \u00a0\nYou know\u2026a Marxist would say\u2026a common way that a Marxist would look at the economic history of the 20th century is that since the inception of capitalism being the primary economic model in western society\u2026a lot has changed. They'd say that it worked for a while\u2026uh\u2026workers in the western world were living on sort of economic islands\u2026they were able to demand a better quality of life from their employer\u2026better wages\u2026better work conditions, etc. \u00a0\nBut then around 1968\u20261971 whenever you think global trade really started its massive expansion\u2026the people that controlled the means of production that had to pay these people in the west all these higher wages\u2026they \u00a0looked at places like China and India and Taiwan and realized hey\u2026these people over here will do the same work for pennies on the dollar\u2026so the jobs started leaving. Marxists call this the mass exodus of jobs and they'd say that we're still living in its wake\u2026they'd say that how convenient right around the mid 1970's is when people started taking out credit cards and going into massive debt as just a normal part of life. Fast forward to today and just to graduate from college and be able to contribute to society you practically HAVE to go into tens of thousands of dollars in debt\u2026not to mention that house you want to buy or that car. \u00a0\nAnyway, the point is: Marx believes there are internal conflicts built into the capitalist system\u2026and I guess the next question is: why didn't we see this coming? I mean when Adam Smith writes the wealth of nations and walks up into some guys office thats making the decisions and goes knock knock\u2026whos there\u2026wapow\u2026capitalism. Why didn't we see these problems coming then? Well the answers pretty complicated but one of the biggest answers is that we were living in an entirely different world. \u00a0\nReally brief background on the origins of capitalism. So during the transition phase between the feudal system and capitalism in Europe\u2026 there were a lot of families that used to live and work the land or be part owners of the land that were displaced because of things called Inclosure Acts\u2026or things like the Inclosure Acts of the United Kingdom given your respective country. The Inclosure acts were a series of actions that made land that used to be common land into land that can be privately owned. So naturally, the people that used to live on this..common land\u2026had to find somewhere else to go. A lot of people\u2026had to find somewhere else to go and survive. So, it makes sense\u2026 they went to where the jobs were\u2026over this handful of generations at the dawn of the industrial revolution\u2026these people would be making a huge change to their lifestyle\u2026going from working the land to working in factories, textile mills, etc. \u00a0\nNow it's important to understand the mindset that these nation states were in during this time. They were just that\u2026nation states that were competing with each other. Nation states that were emerging into new worlds that they could trade with. All of a sudden you could trade with India and China and the American Colonies if you want\u2026the problem was: how are you going to make enough stuff to fill that demand? How can you go from just making enough stuff for just your nation state and your immediate neighbors to now\u2026 ten countries worth of stuff\u2026twenty countries worth of stuff.\u00a0\nCouple this with the fact that it was a widely held view at the time that the export capacity of your economy is directly related to your economic strength\u2026and when Adam Smith introduces the ideas of specialization and division of labor\u2026you're going to grab onto that with both hands!\u00a0\nYou know instead of having one guy that makes clocks all day\u2026works really hard for ten hours and might be able to make one clock\u2026Adam Smith says let's have him specialize in making the cogs\u2026let's have her specialize in making the springs\u2026and with this more focused, specialized, menial task as the only thing that they're doing\u2026there's much fewer moving parts to consider\u2026they refine their systems faster and maybe they can make 1000 cogs in a day\u2026so collectively 10 people might be able to make 1000 clocks in a day, as opposed to the 10 they'd be able to make if each one of them had to do every facet of the clock production. \u00a0\nKarl Marx would say: what a great idea to make a lot of clocks! This is what Capitalism is great at\u2026making a lot of stuff and finding out what the next thing is we have to make and then making \u00a0a lot of THAT stuff. But is\u2026making the most stuff possible so that we can make the most money possible all that we should be concerned about? Marx thinks it'd be one thing if humans were robots\u2026but they're not. We're forgetting about the effects of the fact that it's ultimately human beings that have to make all this stuff. \u00a0\nOne of the big criticisms he has of capitalism is that it alienates the worker from a sense of purpose or fulfillment. The point that he's making is one that we can ALL relate to living in a capitalist system. We've all had a job at some point or known someone that's had a job they don't really like that much\u2026it's boring\u2026unfulfilling and makes you feel like a meaningless cog in a machine. Karl Marx says that this is a natural byproduct of specialization. \u00a0\nYes, specialization is great at making a ton of stuff\u2026but the more specialized jobs become the less important the person feels that's doing the work. For example, if you're the guy down at the Siracha factory and you work on an assembly line and you're the guy that puts the green cap on top of the bottles\u2026all day long. It's very difficult for you to see the positive effect that you're having on society\u2026you probably don't walk into a Teriyaki place, look around at all the bottles and be like yup\u2026that was me. \u00a0\nNo, Marx says to feel fulfilled we need to \"see ourselves in our work.\" Back to the clock making example\u2026if you're the person that builds the entire clock start to finish\u2026there's a craftsmanship to that. There's a connection you can have with it. The way you build that clock is a representation of you and your personality. Let's say you make a simple, elegant clock made with attention to detail\u2026maybe that's the way you approach every aspect of your life. You see a little piece of YOU in that clock. You walk around and see your clocks hanging around and you feel like you contributed something essential to the world. Sure, you can only make one of them a day\u2026but the process was fulfilling to you. \u00a0\nBut instead of that, Marx says, we got this guy churning out a thousand cogs a day and not caring about a single one of them. And he says what happens\u2026 is that this dynamic creates a disconnect between what we do to serve others in our society\u2026 and what we WISH we could do or what we know were capable of doing\u2026if only the system didn't require you to be so highly specialized in an attempt to make as much stuff as we possibly can. Again, for anyone that's ever worked a really monotonous job and you felt as though you had so much more to give to your fellow human beings\u2026you can kind of see where he is coming from here. \u00a0\nSo Karl Marx continues on and says\u2026 look\u2026 this would be a bad enough state of affairs on its own\u2026but the fact is this isn't the only negative affect on the workers that capitalism ignores. Another way that it undermines the employee is that it makes them feel terrified about how expendable they are AS a single, insignificant cog in this machine. \u00a0\nLook if the recession in 2008 taught us anything\u2026it's that we are far removed from the days where you are a loyal employee of a company and you suck it up for the company and the company takes care of you in good times and in bad. No, if it means a better bottom line\u2026anyone is expendable. Marx would've predicted this dynamic and he says that this feeling that the worker has\u2026that if they make a couple of mistakes or if anything changes that's out of their control where it's no longer profitable for the company for them to be an employee\u2026termination. \u00a0\nThis is a horrible, volatile place to spend every day of your life\u2026and Marx says it goes back even to our roots as human beings. We hate to be rejected\u2026we're terrified of wearing the wrong color shirt or having the wrong haircut and then having our friends or our tribe cast us out into the wilderness alone. Capitalism insures that this is always the case for the worker. \u00a0\nNow we can see a pattern emerging here right? What I mean is: Both of these critiques of capitalism are a result of how production\u2026 and therefore capital is the primary thing to strive for\u2026and how that ignores and sort of dehumanizes the people that have to operate within it as workers. \u00a0\nAgain, like we talked about a couple episodes ago\u2026to Marx\u2026the working class is the exploited class. And he'd say not only is their emotional quality of life exploited like in these first two examples, but also their physical production. \u00a0\nMarx believed that capitalism at it's core\u2026 was simply getting someone to do something for one price and then selling it to somebody else for a much higher price. And if you doubt this at all, Marx would probably ask you to take a look at the job you have right now. At some point in the process of getting that job you went in for an interview\u2026landed the job and they told you how much they'd pay you to do the work\u2026let's say $40 an hour. \u00a0\u00a0\nNow at some level you realize that they are profiting off of the work that you're doing for them. If they weren't, they'd either pay you less or not hire you. Now all that they're doing there is getting you to do something for one price and then selling it to somebody else for a higher price\u2026in other words\u2026you're not getting paid what you're actually worth\u2026just what you expect. The difference between what you're actually worth and what you expect\u2026well the companies have a name for this\u2026it's called profit\u2026but to Marx\u2026he says that profit is just a euphemism for theft. While you at the bottom are working hard producing more than you get in your paycheck each week\u2026a handful of people at the top of the business are getting way more than they produce. \u00a0\nMarx says, why does the system have to be this way? Why do we necessarily HAVE to have a dynamic where a small handful of people control all the means of production and use that power to blackmail the working class? Are we destined to be this way forever? Is there perhaps another economic system we might be able to adopt that addresses this, maybe one that focuses on human prosperity exclusively as opposed to this capital stuff that claims to lead to prosperity?\u00a0\nAnd on that same note Marx would ask\u2026why in the world would we be so satisfied with this economic climate that's so volatile? Every morning when you turn on the TV you have some dude ringing a bell in New York City at the stock exchange\u2026and these people sit around all day long tracking the volatility of the economy\u2026dreading the idea of there being some horrific crash of the numbers that day. Oh what if the squiggly line goes down\u2026NO! Oh good look it's going up! \u2026 Every ten years we have a steep decline\u2026maybe it fixes itself\u2026maybe we sink into a depression where people are in bread lines suffering begging for work\u2026we've been told that these ebbs and flows of the economy are just a natural part of the world\u2026but Marx would say it's a hallmark of Capitalism. \u00a0\nHe'd say yeah, remember before when the problem was that we could make ENOUGH stuff? Well capitalism did it's job. It made our economy WAY more efficient and productive. The problem is, now we're making way too much and the disparity between whats being produced and what is being purchased eventually compounds and causes these huge volatile spikes. Now, I'm not sure if that theory shores up with what we think we know in modern economics, but the important part to Marx is that we've done something pretty amazing. We have actually created an economic climate that is SO productive and SO efficient\u2026that in theory\u2026no one EVER has to go without anything. \u00a0\nWhat other economic system throughout history can claim to have done that? More importantly to Marx\u2026we have more empty houses than homeless people. We have more cars in those unsold dealership overflow lots than we have citizens without reliable transportation. In fact, Marx says\u2026if we have this capacity to produce WAY MORE than we would ever need\u2026there's MORE good news\u2026not everyone has to work! \u00a0\nWhy NOT just sit home or explore hobbies and enjoy your life if you can. Why does everyone have to work? The human species has DONE IT! We've become so efficient\u2026people get to go home early from work! The managers sending people home! Point is, we as members of this capitalistic society have been conditioned to think of this state of not working as a BAD thing. \u00a0\nYou know\u2026the unemployment rate is really high this month. Marx would call it the freedom rate. And just think about that\u2026when we elect a president and beg for them to get America back to work! Marx would see that as us begging to be put back in chains! \u00a0\nAnyway, it should be pretty clear what Marx's position is given the similarities between these criticisms. It seems like there's two fundamental problems with capitalism in his eyes: one is that private individuals have the ability to own the means of production\u2026which is a very small handful of people\u2026and number two is that when you give people that level of power over an economic system, they're going to inevitably use that power to try to make the system work better in their favor. \u00a0\nFor example, the idea being that when a private individual owns a factory that has 500 employees\u2026and they all of a sudden have the ability to go to Brazil and hire 500 people there for way cheaper than they're paying now, it's not surprising that they'd make that choice to move the factory and put all those other people out of work. Now on the other hand\u2026to Marx\u2026if that factory\u2026if the means of production was controlled by the workers of the factory\u2026they would never choose to move the factory to Brazil\u2026they would never put themselves out of work or go without the tax revenue generated to fund their community's police force or fund their schools\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0Anyway, maybe I'm getting a little bit into future episodes. Speaking of future episodes\u2026even though we're going to be talking about a lot of criticisms of Marx in future episodes, I feel like it would be wrong for me to not mention a few common ones right now\u2026keep in mind we'll talk about many of these in more detail soon. One really common one is that everything Marx is saying is great on paper, but it's actually not realistic\u2026its a horrible, delusional utopia when it's actually practiced. \u00a0\nAnother common one is that Marx fails to take into account human nature well enough\u2026that there will always be lazy people out there that don't want to work and that if we take away the capitalist structure\u2026it saps them of any motivation to even marginally contribute to society. \u00a0\nAnother one is that not every job out there is going to have people ready and willing to do it simply because it's fulfilling to them. This isn't like the guy that makes the clock that's a representation of him\u2026some jobs aren't going to have that luxury\u2026like nobodies going to crawl into the sewer and unclog it because they\u2026you know\u2026see a piece of themselves represented in the overflowing fecal matter. Who's gonna do THOSE jobs Karl Marx?\u00a0\nMarx would have responses to all of these, but the main thing he would say back to them is probably that\u2026at least\u2026the effects caused by these problems are manageable. Now compare these to the problems caused by capitalism. The disdain that individuals are conditioned to have towards each other because they see them all as in competition with them. The terrible effects on the environment because of the ceaseless desire to keep producing and consuming more and more beyond our means. The massive income disparity where the top 70 people in the world have more than the bottom three billion combined\u2026many of them dying of starvation, dehydration or curable diseases. I think Marx would say\u2026look at the problems we're satisfied with contending with as an alternative. \u00a0\nThis episode was a huge test for me\u2026and I hope it was as interesting to you as it was difficult to write. Expect a new episode very soon. I'm back for real this time. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time. \u00a0\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_64": {"date": "2016-5-26", "text": "Posted on May 26, 2016\nEpisode 82 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #082\u00a0on The Austrian School of Economics.

Patreon.com/philosophizethis\u00a0if you want to keep the show going, we also have the Amazon banner if you're buying something from there anyway\u2026Hope you love the show today, let's get onto the program. \u00a0\nSo last week we talked about all kinds of stuff\u2026we talked Karl Marx and the glaring problems he saw there being with Capitalism\u2026we talked about the political ideology he prescribed as a solution to those problems\u2026we talked about me\u2026and how after 81 episodes I finally needed to come clean with everyone\u2026although I don't believe in a world of forms or a near infinity of tiny monads that make up the fabric of reality or an even evil demon\u2026whose constantly trying to deceive me\u2026apparently I'm a Marxist through and through\u2026but the good news is today we're going to be talking about the counterpoints to the things I believe in so dearly\u2026were going to be talking about the critiques of Marx that you Capitalist pigs have been throwing in my face for my entire life\u2026 \u00a0\nIn fact\u2026something I've noticed as a closet Marxist over the years\u2026ok I'll stop\u2026you guys get the point. Whenever somebody has a problem with something that Marx says\u2026they can disagree with the guy on a number of different levels\u2026but it's usually in one of two places. They either disagree with Communism\u2026as a political ideology. Or they disagree with the economic inferences that Marx makes\u2026you know the way he viewed markets, how they work, people within markets\u2026etc. But one important thing to understand before we move forward and talk about all the different thinkers over the years that have spent decades of their life trying to prove to people that Marx is wrong\u2026is that a good way to organize all of these criticisms of Marx is to understand that there is a very REAL connection between the beliefs that Marx held about economics, and the political ideology that he created and espoused. \u00a0\nIt's actually really interesting to think about how it relates to us\u2026how the beliefs that we have about how economic systems work are often directly related to who we are willing to vote for in an election. I mean if that is true\u2026think about how important economics is. Think about how important it is for us to have an understanding of the history of economics. \u00a0\nMaybe this is a little too hypothetical\u2026for example\u2026imagine you're a card carrying Marxist living in the United States in the year 2016\u2026like me\u2026imagine you have two presidential candidates to choose from\u2026Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. Well if your economic views are that Capitalism is a fundamentally immoral system based on theft and exploitation of the worker\u2026you're probably going to have a hard time going to the ballot box and voting for a Capitalist like a Donald Trump. I mean, no matter how many other issues you may agree with him on\u2026just given the global, economically driven world that we live in\u2026how can you ever justify theft and exploitation of everyone\u2026 in the name of progressing a few single issues you agree with the guy on.\u00a0\nWhat I'm saying is: you may look at the last couple episodes and think that this has turned into an economics podcast. You know, I'm changing the name to Monetize This! now. My point is: given the world that we live in, our views on economics are the foundation of many of the values that we hold..not the least of which might be the political ideology that we end up voting for. Understanding the economic theory of our day\u2026massively helps us in understanding the political philosophy of our day. \u00a0\nNow back to the people disagree with Marx, usually in two broad categories right? Communism and his economic beliefs\u2026well if we look at it in terms of these two main categories of disagreement that people have\u2026this square of opposition starts to emerge\u2026 where each type of disagreement represents one side of the square. One side of the square would be people that agree with Marx's economic views, but disagree with Communism. You know, they agree with the criticisms Marx is making of capitalism, it's just that Communism is not the best solution to those problems. \u00a0\nNow, another side of the square would be people that agree with the ideology of Communism, but disagree with Marx's economic views. You know they'd say, Marx, bless his heart he lived and wrote all this stuff in the mid-1800's\u2026we've come a long way since then in our understanding of economics\u2026Communism IS the correct solution to the problem\u2026 but we need to make some tweaks to the way HE thought about economics in the 1800s. His solution was correct\u2026his premise was not. \u00a0\nNow obviously another side of the square would be people that just agree with him\u2026they agree with both his economics AND political ideology\u2026but then the last side of the square would be the opposite\u2026people that disagree with both\u2026his economics and political ideology. \u00a0\nAnd the people we're going to be talking about today fall into this last category. But it's interesting\u2026because its the ECONOMIC inferences that Marx makes that sets the foundation for why Communism needs to be implemented\u2026one thing that comes as a byproduct of that is that if you are able to refute the economic theory of Marx\u2026At that point\u2026you're able to kill two birds with one stone. It sort of cuts the legs out from underneath communism. At that point Communism becomes just a really interesting\u2026abstract theory about how society might be organized\u2026if we\u2026happened to live\u2026in a completely different universe where that's actually how economics worked! \u00a0\nJust like Plato's Republic or Augustine's City of God or Francis Bacon's New Atlantis\u2026let's take all these zany ideas\u2026and put them next to Dr. Seuss FAR AWAY from the non-fiction section of the library. \u00a0\u00a0\nPoint is: this is why this collection of people that we're talking about today spent a lot of time trying to refute the ECONOMIC philosophy of Marx\u2026 as opposed to the political philosophy. \u00a0\nNow, if you were one of these people\u2026commissioned with the task of finding fault in Marx's economics\u2026a really good place to start\u2026one of the cornerstones of his thought that we talked about last time is the notion that profit\u2026is theft. Profit is a euphemism for the exploitation of the worker\u2026Capitalism is not just wrong as an economic theory\u2026it is a fundamentally immoral system because it allows for the worker who is producing a certain amount of value for an employer\u2026just like the slaves in chattel slavery\u2026just like the peasants of the feudal system\u2026the worker in a capitalist society is paid less than the value they're producing for that employer\u2026the discrepancy between these two values being to Marx\u2026the equivalent of strong arm robbery. Why does it have to be this way?\u00a0\nBut therein lies an assumption, doesn't it\u2026aren't we assuming there\u2026that it's possible to objectively and consistently estimate the true value of someone's labor? Tons of questions arise\u2026like, let's say we wanted to pay a worker EXACTLY what they produce in value\u2026where do we get that number from? How do we even know what they're worth in the first place\u2026is the value they're producing always the same\u2026does it never fluctuate? If it does fluctuate\u2026should we pay them less that week and more next week? Not to mention, how do we even know where to start when it comes to WHAT we should pay these workers? Just as a thought experiment for a second..think about the value a worker provides\u2026now think about it in terms of an increment other than dollars and cents\u2026just like a dollar bill\u2026a bag of charcoal has a certain amount of value\u2026how many bags of charcoal should I pay you for eight hours of your work? The bigger question is: how do we even know what a bag of charcoal is worth?\u00a0\nWell finding an answer to all of these more specific questions is ultimately based on our answer to a much more SIMPLE question in economics. And because it's such a simple question\u2026I think intuitively to us it may SEEM like there must be a very simple ANSWER to this question\u2026but history I guess has proven otherwise. And the question is this: what determines the value of anything? How do we know what to charge for something at all\u2026how do the great philosophers Bob Barker and Drew Carrey just conveniently always seem to know the exact cost of a Swiffer.\u00a0\nWell before there was ever the Price is Right\u2026there was paradox within economics\u2026a famous paradox that dates back generation after generation that practically every economic philosopher has taken a crack at in some capacity: it's called the diamond/water paradox. \u00a0\nIt goes like this: water is an absolutely essential part of human life. We're made out of the stuff. Seven days without water\u2026you're dead. Ok, so knowing that\u2026why is it that water is so cheap and a diamond costs thousands and thousands of dollars. I don't NEED a diamond. I mean, personally I like to have them in the giant crucifix I wear around my neck, but that's just more so I can be accepted by my hip hop counterparts\u2026I NEED water to survive, but for some reason it costs next to nothing for me to get a glass of water. \u00a0\nWhy is it that a diamond costs so much more than a glass of water?\u00a0\nWell Marx thought\u2026 like many before him\u2026 probably put most articulately by David Ricardo, \u00a0\n\"The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\" \u00a0\nIn other words, the reason why a diamond costs so much more than a glass of water is because it takes much more labor to produce one diamond\u2026 than to produce one glass of water. I mean, to make a diamond you have to fly to some diamond mine, put on one of those helmets with a flashlight, risk life and limb navigating the bowels of the mine, hammer a diamond out of the wall, fly home, cut it, polish it, set it\u2026it takes a lot more labor to do that than to just go down to the nearest fresh water source and scoop up a glass of water for someone. \u00a0\nThis is what's known as the Labor Theory of Value\u2026or that the value of a commodity is directly related to the amount of labor that it took to produce. Now, Marx has his own nuanced brand of it but he would say that although you can definitely find exceptions to that rule, the exceptions can be explained away and that the vast majority of the time it is true.\u00a0\nAs you can imagine\u2026this Labor Theory of Value\u2026and how the value\u2026.is based on someones labor\u2026this becomes a really important part of Marx's philosophy and a crucial part of his idea that profit is theft. So if you're somebody that's trying to refute that point\u2026a great place to start is by trying to refute the Labor Theory of Value. Now right around this time in history there's three big economic thinkers that are trying to refute this Labor Theory of Value: There was Leon Walras from Switzerland, William Jevons from England, and a man named Mr. Karl Menger who was from Austria and would eventually be known as the first big thinker of the Austrian School of Economics. That's who we're talking about today: the great Austrian Economists and their critiques of Marx. \u00a0\nSo the first thing you gotta do\u2026 if you want to destroy the labor theory of value is to come up with another answer to that diamond/water paradox. I mean, if it's not the amount of labor required that determines what something's worth\u2026what is it? \u00a0\nNow what a lot of people do here is say: no! it's not the amount of labor that makes something valuable\u2026it's the law of supply and demand! \u00a0\n\u00a0You guys all know about supply and demand\u2026you know theres a demand for something\u2026if the demand increases over the supply\u2026.blah blah supply and demand. An Austrian Economist would say, well that's definitely PART of it\u2026but it can't be the whole story because we see exceptions to that rule all the time\u2026\u00a0\nThink about Las Vegas, Nevada. A glimmering jewel in the middle of a barren desert. The chance of fortune and great spectacles await you\u2026unfortunately what also awaits you are seven dollar bottles of water. What's even more shocking is that people regularly pay\u2026seven dollars\u2026for a bottle of water. So, is a bottle of water seven dollars because of a scarcity of water? Even though Las Vegas is in the middle of the desert\u2026is there a scarcity of bottles of water that's causing the price to be that high? Is Aquafina delivering water at maximum capacity to Las Vegas, or do the vendors have a dozen cases of water in the back that just aren't on the shelves yet?\u00a0\nPoint is: the Austrians would say that the value of something can't be based SOLELY on supply and demand\u2026it can't be that simple\u2026and to understand what they think is missing from that theory, let's look at the diamond water paradox again, but this time let's not do it from the, comfy sleeping bag of Las Vegas, Nevada or modern civilization\u2026now let's do it and pretend we're stranded in the middle of the Sahara desert. What changes? Well, we've all heard the adage\u2026we're stranded on the desert island\u2026I have a cheeseburger and you have a million dollars\u2026who is richer? Well this is the sentiment the Austrian Economists are expressing here. \u00a0\nWhen you're in the middle of the desert severely dehydrated and somebody asks you which you'd pay more for\u2026a diamond or a glass of water, obviously the answer is going to be a glass of water. The Austrians would say that what you're doing there is making a subjective judgment about the value of a glass of water. See in that particular context\u2026a glass of water is way more valuable than a diamond\u2026however if for some reason you could teleport back to your house in that moment\u2026it wouldn't be very long at all before you would change your mind and say the diamond is more valuable.\u00a0\nWhat does this mean? \u00a0\nIt means that the value of a commodity isn't based on something objective like the amount of time it took for someone to produce it or the scarcity of the item\u2026but on the conglomeration of individuals making subjective value judgments based on whatever particular set of circumstances they're in. The level of value of an item is the gap, or margin that an individual assigns to how valuable it would be to have one more of that item in those circumstances. If we're sitting at home on the couch with the kitchen sink not far away from us, the value of water or the margin that the individual assigns to having one additional glass of water is really small. In the middle of the desert\u2026that gap, or margin is massive. This is better known as the subjective theory of value. \u00a0\nI keep peppering the word \"margin\" in there because that's what this type of economics is called \"marginalism\". You know it's often said by economists that the idea of this subjective margin is really appealing to the average person. You can kind of see why\u2026it takes economics away from theory and mathematical equations and it makes it something very human. Ultimately, it's individuals that are making these decisions about how valuable something is\u2026and what they decide the value is\u2026 is based on any number of factors\u2026the time period or culture they live in\u2026their level of hydration or hunger in that moment\u2026how they feel about the brand they're buying from\u2026even whether they got eight hours of sleep last night. It makes it all feel very human. \u00a0\nBut let's slow down for a second\u2026let's keep in mind what the Austrians were originally trying to refute here\u2026remember\u2026it was Marx's idea that profit is theft. No question, if we think of this as a war that the Austrians are waging on the idea that profit is theft\u2026no question the first attack that the they launched in this war was on the Labor Theory of Value, but even if we're willing to grant that the subjective theory of value is a knockdown argument to the labor theory of value\u2026this certainly doesn't do away entirely with the idea that profit is another word for the exploitation of workers, right?\u00a0\nReally, all the subjective theory of value accomplishes here is to make it so that we don't have this really neat package of: the value that a worker produces is equivalent to their labor and that we should pay workers the total value of what they produce. Again, if we accept the subjective theory of value, it does away with the FIRST part of that statement\u2026 the value that a worker produces is equivalent to their labor\u2026but it doesn't explain why we shouldn't pay workers the total value of what they produce. A Marxist would say: even if we accept that your new theory totally refutes the labor theory of value\u2026the question still remains: Why is it ok for a capitalist that controls the means of production to pay workers less than the value they produce and take the rest for themselves?\u00a0\nWhat an Austrian Economist would probably say back to that question is that the problem is that it assumes that the laborers aren't already being paid for the value of their capacity to work. \u00a0\nThey'd say\u2026who gave that worker that job in the first place? The employer\u2026that heartless capitalist that started the company\u2026and what did they do initially? Well they found an empty plot of land that wasn't producing anything\u2026and they BUILT\u2026from the ground up with their bare hands\u2026the means of production that they control. \u00a0\nThey've taken an empty, unproductive plot of land and they've transformed it into a bustling factory where hundreds of people are able to make money and provide for themselves and their families. Now, let's not gloss over that process\u2026to make this factory it took that person ingenuity, a tremendous amount of risk, knowledge of the marketplace, hard work, vision, perseverance, being at the right place at the right time\u2026through all of this sacrifice, this capitalist has created essentially a magnifying glass of value. A place where people can not only work and make a living, but also because they have access to this factory and the equipment inside of it and all of the efficiency that comes along with it\u2026these workers are able to produce much more value in one hour of work than they otherwise would be able to if the factory didn't exist. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe sacrifice that the capitalist made to make this magnifying glass of a worker's value\u2026 coupled with the ceaseless struggle that they have to contend with of maintaining the factory and the equipment and employee morale and making sure the factory next door doesn't put them and all of the people that work at the factory out of a job\u2026just like a worker gets paid a wage to do THEIR job and produce a certain amount of value at the factory\u2026profit is really just the wage that the capitalist is being paid to magnify and sustain all of this additional value their sacrifice is providing. Of course they get paid more\u2026without them\u2026everyone would be out of work.\u00a0\nNow a Marxist might hear this and argue back, well that doesn't really tell the whole story. That really only explains the profit of capitalists that are actively out there taking risks, building factories and providing jobs to people. What about idle capitalists? What about Scrooge McDuck? What about people that have all of their money in a bank earning interest\u2026or better yet\u2026publicly traded companies have shareholders that own a certain percentage of the company. It's customary at the end of the quarter to send the shareholders checks in the mail known as quarterly dividends. \u00a0\nA Marxist might ask: why is that guy getting a check in the mail? That guy never stepped FOOT in a factory\u2026did that money just appear out of thin air? Where is that money coming from if not the exploited labor of somebody else? And in keeping with your previous example about how the capitalist sacrificed so much to earn that \"wage\" that you call profit\u2026what did that guy sacrifice? What sitting around all day watching a line go up and down?\u00a0\nThe Austrians have a really interesting response to this question\u2026they'd say that these shareholders ARE sacrificing something\u2026and it comes back to their subjective theory of marginal value. But in this case\u2026instead of the subjective value being changed by something like\u2026being in the middle of the desert\u2026this time the value is altered because of the way that people look at the value of something in relation to time. We seem to value things available to us immediately more than we value things that are available to us in the future. \u00a0\nReal world example: let's say you needed a pair of running shoes\u2026so you go on Amazon.com and find some that you like and get to the checkout screen and you're left with a choice. You can pay $80 for the shoes to be delivered to you in three days\u2026or you can pay $80 for the shoes to be delivered to you in three years. Which do you choose? Keep in mind\u2026it's the same pair of shoes\u2026you're still getting an $80 pair of shoes in three years\u2026you just have to wait three years to get them. The Austrians would say it's not that crazy to think that your subjective value of shoes now vs. shoes three years from now would be different. You wouldn't pay as much for the shoes in three years\u2026and why should you? Think of the opportunity cost! Imagine all the days over those three years you could've been smiling, running through the park in your new shoes like you're on a commercial for rheumatoid arthritis and someone's reading the long list of side effects! Imagine what could've been.\u00a0\nNow take that same psychology about the purchase of the shoes on Amazon and apply it to the capitalists that just have their money sitting in a bank earning interest or investing in companies. Companies go out of business all the time\u2026not ten years ago every bank in this country almost went out of business\u2026and their money is only federally insured up to $250,000. These people are assuming a great risk, and for what? What is their money doing? Banks are loaning it out to people to make their dreams come true\u2026so they can buy their dream house\u2026so someone can open up that hot dog stand they always wanted to\u2026so someone can buy a car and have reliable transportation to be able to contribute to society. Their money is just sitting there. Making the world a better place\u2026and think of the opportunity cost on THEIR end. \u00a0\nThey've already made their money. They're forgoing consumption now for consumption later. They could theoretically pull every penny out of the bank and take a party bus to Macau, China and consume, consume, consume\u2026spend every penny they ever made. Just like you would have to sacrifice three years of potential running days in the park with your new shoes\u2026these people have to sacrifice years of having that money in the bank instead of buying something else\u2026the Austrians would ask\u2026why isn't it fair that their sacrifice should be honored with a little interest?\u00a0\nOne final point\u2026and by the way so much of what makes up Austrian economics is a set of claims about how the world works\u2026it goes much deeper than this episode this is really just some interesting points on how they thought they refuted Marx\u2026if you guys like the subject matter obviously we can do more on it in the future\u2026but anyway probably one of the most interesting ideas to me that comes out of Austrian economics is the idea that prices\u2026are not only a number on the shelf in the supermarket\u2026but purveyors of knowledge about the state of things all over the world. \u00a0\nHere's what they mean by that: the great Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek has a really famous example that talks about the importance of the prices of things that we buy where he talks about a tin shortage. Just to summarize it briefly, he says that we are human beings that understand there's not an infinite supply of anything\u2026we have a finite number of resources on this planet to harvest during our time here and that because of that fact, in a perfect world if the supply of one of those resources started to run out\u2026it stands to reason that we would want people to use less of it and find other alternatives.\u00a0\n\u00a0Now let's say for example that the supply of tin started to run out\u2026well we have a problem: how do we get the information to EVERYONE in the world that\u2026hey! we're running out of tin here! Slow down! \u00a0Getting this message out is a logistical nightmare though. It's not like everybody watches the same TV station or even watches TV. So how do we reliably get that message out?\u00a0\nWell Hayek and many others say that this is one of the great things about the price system. You don't have to find a way to go door to door and keep everyone updated on this week's scarcity report\u2026no the price system sends the message to the people that matter: the consumers interested in consuming things made out of tin! Tin farmers start to charge more for their tin\u2026tin foil companies start to charge more for their tin foil and when someone goes to the supermarket and has to choose between foil made out of tin or foil made out of aluminum\u2026they don't even need to know WHY there's a tin shortage\u2026the price informs them of what's going on in the world of tin. \u00a0\u00a0\nNow the reason this point matters when it comes to Marx is that Hayek would argue that the ONLY way the price system works and delivers this information to consumers is if it is functioning in a system where private property is protected and can be freely exchanged. \u00a0\nIf nobody owns anything, if people aren't making mutually beneficial exchanges with other people\u2026how can price possibly reflect the true value of something? This extends into the means of production\u2026if the means of production aren't privately owned entities conducting exchanges with other entities that are privately owned\u2026how can they ever get this wealth of information that the pricing system gives us when we're in a system that doesn't denounce private property rights like Marx does? \u00a0\nPrice is a purveyor of information. Again, much more Austrian stuff to come, but the ideas we talked about on this episode are probably the most relevant to Marx. Hope you guys loved the show and have some food for thought. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time. \u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_65": {"date": "2016-6-4", "text": "Posted on June 4, 2016\nEpisode 83 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #083\u00a0on Henry David Thoreau. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHenry David Thoreau was an American author and philosopher who in the year 1845 resigned himself from public life to a shack, in the woods, next to a lake\u2026for two years, two months and two days of his life. Why? Well if you wanted to get a little closer to finding out why\u2026 might not be a bad idea to visit the actual shack that he lived in! You can do it! Well, it\u2019s a replica shack\u2026they rebuilt the shack\u2026but you CAN visit the actual site where he built his shack before it got torn down\u2026they found the hearth or the bottom of the fireplace buried just under the dirt and from there they extrapolated where the rest of the cabin had to have been\u2026but the fact remains\u2026to this day\u2026 you can go to concord Massachusetts and stand on the exact spot where Thoreau stood\u2026you can see the actual views that he writes about\u2026you can close your eyes and listen and if you can drown out the sound of the SUVs and motorcycles passing by just behind you can hear many of the same things he heard. Let\u2019s say you did it. Let\u2019s say you did visit Walden Pond in today\u2019s world\u2026what you\u2019d see\u2026are narrow trails\u2026 fairly dense woods all around you\u2026and when you approached the actual site where Thoreau built his cabin you\u2019d come to a clearing and you\u2019d see a big piece of wood staring you in the face\u2026and etched into this piece of wood is one of the most iconic lines from his famous account of his time out there and it goes like this: \u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201d Do you ever worry about that? Do you ever worry about what he\u2019s talking about here? Waking up one morning\u202650 60 years old and having an epiphany about life that had been staring you in the face your whole life and if only you had done things just a little differently you would have realized it when you were twenty and not wasted decades of your life? Well I do. I worry about that stuff all the time. Kind of a strange thing to worry about\u2026the worry doesn\u2019t really solve anything\u2026all it really does is keep you motivated to keep thinking about life and your place in the world so that at least if you DO wake up 60 years old and realize you\u2019ve wasted it all\u2026at least you put in all the work you could have. Well, Thoreau seems to be of a similar mindset\u2026he wants to live deliberately\u2026which it seems by that quote is a very active process and he wants to do this\u2026so that he doesn\u2019t come to the end of his life and realize that he never lived at all. Now, I don't think many people would disagree that they don\u2019t want to come to the end of their life and feel like they wasted it\u2026the confusion that most people have about that quote is his method of achieving that. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to waste my life either\u2026but when I'm brainstorming all the ways I'm gonna try to prevent that from happening\u2026I don\u2019t arrive at the conclusion that we should go camping for two years. Why would Thoreau go to the woods to accomplish that? Well make no mistake\u2026the lessons that Thoreau learned in this little unassuming cabin of his would go on to change the lives of untold numbers of people, not to mention his own. But to understand why he landed on the woods\u2026in particular\u2026I want to briefly talk about two things that are going to help set the stage\u2026one is the psychology of Thoreau living during the time that he did\u2026and the other is the approach to life commonly known as Transcendentalism. So let\u2019s get right into it: long before Thoreau ever decided to isolate himself at Walden Pond\u2026he knew he didn\u2019t really fit in\u2026with the rest of the kids on the playground. He just didn\u2019t think about things the same way as the average person that was living back then. And you'll find example after example of this if you just take a quick look at his life. For example, Thoreau had just graduated from college\u2026went to Harvard\u2026and he must of been under a tremendous amount of pressure from himself\u2026his family to make this degree he just worked so hard for to actually do something for him\u2026and he gets a job as a school teacher. Well the policy of the school at the time\u2026what the majority of the community of people he was serving wanted him to do if the kids start misbehaving is to use corporal punishment to keep them in line. Thoreau, living during a time when that kind of thing was acceptable\u2026didn\u2019t like it\u2026so he quit his job. Thoreau was a conservationist during a time when we didn\u2019t have grisly images of evil corporations sawing down acres of trees leaving pandas with no where to live. He saw the environmental writing on the wall before most people even realized it could POTENTIALLY be a problem. Thoreau was a huge opponent of slavery\u2026during a time when people owned slaves all around him and weren\u2019t being morally denounced for doing so. Point is: given where society has gone since his day and age\u2026Thoreau seemed to be way ahead of his time. But whether he KNEW he was right or wrong or not\u2026he still has to live in a world surrounded by people that don\u2019t see any problem with this stuff. Now this raises a very important question if you're Thoreau\u2026what do you do about it? What do you do about the fact that you live in a society that endorses all kinds of stuff that you think is immoral? Not an easy question to answer\u2026after all\u2026you\u2019re just one citizen\u2026why are you so special? Should the rest of the country have to bend to your will so that you get what you want? And the extension of that is\u2026democracy is majority rule\u2026do you have an obligation to your fellow citizens to go along with what the majority has deemed to be morally acceptable? On the other hand, you might feel the exact opposite! You might feel like if you see something going on that you think is wrong\u2026you might feel like you have an obligation to NOT keep quiet. You need to stand up for what you believe in and change the world! This was not an easy question to answer for Thoreau early in his life. But then something changed. Then it became really easy to answer that question\u2026probably the strongest conviction Thoreau held throughout the latter stages of his life. And the seed that was planted\u2026that would eventually grow into this strong belief about the answer to this question\u2026was when Thoreau read an essay that was written by a good friend of his named Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2026and the title of this essay was Self-Reliance. Self Reliance was an essay that called for everyone who read it to understand the importance of being, well\u2026self reliant. But maybe a better way of putting it is that it called on people to understand the value of being an individual. Emerson writes: \u201cThere comes a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion.\u201d What Emerson is saying here is that as a human being, we\u2019re born into this very unique condition where we need to find out who we are. We need to find out what we care about\u2026what kind of person were going to be\u2026what sort of legacy we\u2019re going to leave behind us. The problem is\u2026none of us are born with a full understanding of what that\u2019s going to be\u2026so an alluring trap that people fall into is to look around them and just conform to the way that other people act. Certainly gives you a quick and easy answer to the question of what you\u2019re going to be\u2026unfortunately\u2026as Emerson says\u2026imitation is suicide\u2026you going around doing your best imitation of what the people around you are doing in the interest of avoiding a difficult conversation with yourself\u2026is effectively suicide\u2026suicide of your individuality. No, self-reliance preaches a sort of radical non-conformity. Anyone who just blindly believes anything that\u2019s told to them or just blindly goes along with whatever people are doing around them\u2026are foolish to Emerson. Maybe the best way to do this crazy thing called life\u2026is to figure it out for yourself\u2026go out and find your OWN way. See, Thoreau and Emerson are living in a world where advances in science and philosophy show that this thing that we call objective truth\u2026is a pretty slippery thing to define\u2026if not entirely impossible for us to ever arrive at. So as a response to this\u2026what Transcendentalism does\u2026and self-reliance espouses Transcendentalist ideas\u2026is it takes ideas from all over the world at various different points throughout history\u2026There are ideas from Romanticism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Vedism, even further east to Confucianism\u2026it takes all these ideas and creates an approach to life that\u2019s not just about living wisely\u2026but that ultimately that wisdom is something that you as an individual need to arrive at yourself\u2026that inside of everyone there is a genius of sorts\u2026the infinitude of the individual as Emerson writes\u2026and that maybe you should trust your own thought\u2026more than the thought of people that are considered \u201cwise\u201d by other people around you\u2026maybe what we should all be aiming for is not objective truth about the way things are\u2026but a personal truth about the way things are. Now at this point a certain type of person starts nodding emphatically\u2026slowly clapping. Yes. What\u2019s true for me\u2026is not true for you. This is MY truth. Yes, I believe that the ghost of a witch that was wrongly convicted in the 1700\u2019s is haunting the property lines of my house\u2026but that\u2019s MY truth. I\u2019m impervious to criticism! No, it shouldn\u2019t be like this. It shouldn\u2019t be some get out of jail free card to not take the process seriously and then wave it around whenever someone tries to tell you what you believe is ridiculous. No doubt it will be used this way\u2026but the point of the personal truth is to accept the illusive nature of objective truth and show who the onus is truly on\u2026.YOU! This truth is yours and yours alone\u2026the only people it should affect should be you and the people you care about\u2026think of how important your personal pursuit of truth becomes in that world. Now if this is what you believe\u2026one of the things that naturally goes along with that\u2026is that one of the worst things you can do is just look around you\u2026 see how other people are acting\u2026 and just blindly copy whatever it is they\u2019re doing. You\u2019re not working to try to figure it out on your own\u2026you\u2019re not trying to arrive at a better personal truth with that strategy\u2026you\u2019re just trying to get by. You\u2019re just killing time in a waiting room\u2026but for what? What are you killing time and waiting for\u2026death? Ralph Waldo Emerson thinks that \u201csociety is in conspiracy against the manhood of its members\u201d\u2026and what he means by that is that civilization\u2026these societies that we live in with our cities and our culdesacs and our farmers markets and all these activities that have us in close quarters with each other bound together by a social contract\u2026these things PROMOTE this mentality of being a passive, quiet, drone that just conforms with everything going on around them and is protected from the baptism of having to take your views about the world to task. In other words, the same way society protects the physically lazy\u2026it also protects the mentally lazy. Society, for all the good stuff it seemingly does for us\u2026it may be the BIGGEST boulder in the way if you\u2019re truly someone that wants to try to live deliberately. This is why\u2026Thoreau removes society from his life. And it wasn\u2019t long after he read Emerson\u2019s self reliance that he went to his friend Emerson and asked if he could live in a shack on his property in concord Massachusetts\u2026at which point Emerson said\u2026what have I done\u2026look when i wrote the essay i didn\u2019t really anticipate everyone coming and wanting to live on MY property\u2026it was more of like a personal property thing\u2026like your PERSONAL truth. Just kidding he let him. Now as you can imagine, this move to the wilderness seems like it must have been a pretty big shock to Thoreau\u2019s system\u2026i mean, to go from all of the comforts of modern living to just having a desk a couple chairs and a bed\u2026must have been a pretty rough adjustment phase, right? Well the reality was\u2026no\u2026it was actually kind of nice. See, Thoreau realized something as he was thinking about all the ways society is in \u201cconspiracy against the individuality of its members.\u201d He realized the more you own\u2026the more your stuff owns you. He said we often find ourselves not totally happy\u2026not feeling a strong sense of self worth\u2026we think about what we think might bring us that self worth\u2026and a trap that a lot of people fall into is they look OUTSIDE of themselves for the answers to whats going on on the inside of themselves. He says we tell ourselves this lie that oh, if only i get that new pair of shoes or if only I get that car I want then everything's going to be great! But he says what we should realize\u2026is that even if you were trapped like a lost hiker underneath an avalanche of new shoes\u2026YOU would still be there. All of the negative mental holding patterns that contribute to that lack of self worth are still there\u2026you just now have a nike symbol imprinted into your forehead. This goes beyond just stuff by the way\u2026it\u2019s interesting he and Emerson talk about how people often do this with travel. You know they say whats going to finally make me feel right? When I can travel the world and meet all kinds of people and see these different cultures\u2026that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna fix it. But just like the other example\u2026he says whether you\u2019re in China or Russia or India or where ever\u2026the common thread in all three of those examples\u2026is you. The solution to your problem is inside of you\u2026not a lack of some special thing outside of you. And this is just one of the many lessons he learns by removing society from his life and just opening his eyes to what\u2019s going on around him in nature. This is one of the hallmarks of Thoreau\u2019s work: there\u2019s a wisdom in nature\u2026if you\u2019re creative and can spot it. There\u2019s a beautiful passage where he talks about\u2026you know\u2026what happens when a chestnut and an acorn fall on the ground right next to each other in the dirt? Does one of them yield to the other one? Does one decide to just not grow so the other one can grow? No, they both live in accordance with their respective natures until one day one of them overpowers the other one and it dies\u2026one things for sure\u2026regardless of whatever adversity was thrown that chestnut\u2019s way\u2026it was a chestnut through and through until the day it died. Not some facsimile of an acorn or a juniper bush or a geranium\u2026it was a chesnut\u2026and in that sense\u2026we as people can learn a lot from that chestnut about how to live life. You know, personally\u2026something I use as a means of cultivating acceptance about things that are out of my control is actually a reworking of an idea Thoreau had in Walden! You know, I live in the Pacific Northwest and if there\u2019s something there\u2019s a lot of up here it\u2019s meth and trees. So no matter what direction I\u2019m facing\u2026pretty good chance there\u2019s always going to be a tree within eyeshot. Think of trees not as plants for a second\u2026think of them as living things that have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now how do you survive for hundreds and hundreds of years\u2026you gotta be doing something right. Well consider the fact that 24 hours a day seven days a week\u2026while you\u2019re sleeping\u2026working\u2026watching Netflix\u2026constantly\u2026these trees are met with the ceaseless onslaught of the elements. Rain, wind, snow, lightning\u2026here are these wise elders\u2026these living things that deal with that adversity\u2026constantly\u2026and how do they do it? They sway. They sway in the wind. Gently back and forth. If they resist it too much, they break\u2026if they don\u2019t resist enough they have no foundation\u2026they have no roots. What a cool metaphor for how we might approach the ceaseless onslaught of adversity the world throws our way. Anyway, I highly recommend Walden pond if this stuff fascinates you, but Thoreau accomplished his goal when he was out there for two years. He comes back to society looks around him and more clearly than ever before sees not individuals, but passive, ignorant subjects that constantly seek for others to define who they are in exchange for the crumbs of security that society provides them. He says man, isn\u2019t it crazy\u2026that when people are given the freedom to be anyone they want to be\u2026they end up just acting like everyone else. This isn\u2019t life\u2026this is the opposite of life\u2026he says a scarecrow can do everything these people are doing\u2026but this is what the tendency is when we all decide to congregate around each other and conform to society. \u201cMost of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only indispensable, but positive hinderances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.\u201d I guess another upside to Thoreau spending all this time away from people its that he found an answer to that question we talked about at the beginning of the episode\u2026you know whether we\u2019re obligated to keep quiet and be respectful of the majority, or whether we\u2019re obligated to speak up and change things for the better. Well you can probably guess his answer to this now\u2026of course we should speak up! We should never just passively go along and conform to what people are doing around us. Now this in itself is far from a novel concept\u2026but what IS novel\u2026probably the most influential idea given to us by Henry David Thoreau\u2026one that would go on to shape the hunger strikes of India and Mahatma Ghandi\u2026it would go on to shape the civil rights movement in America and countless other movements\u2026it wasn\u2019t THAT we should stand against society if it doesn\u2019t stand for what is morally right\u2026but HOW we should go about standing up to society. He wrote a book called \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d\u2026the opening line of which cites the quote \u201cthe government that governs best, governs least.\u201d now often misattributed to Thomas Jefferson. But keep in mind\u2026what Thoreau is saying there is not that the smallest government is the best government\u2026he\u2019s saying the government should be as simple as possible, but not any simpler and not any more complex than is necessary. See Thoreau realized that majority rule is by its very nature coercive to the individual. This wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal if it didn\u2019t force that individual to live in a society that doesn\u2019t go along with their conscience or beliefs. \u201c. . . the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live under a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free [free in his thinking], fancy-free, imagination-free, that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him.\u201d In other words, as long as you\u2019re living a life that corresponds with your conscience and beliefs about things\u2026nothing can really bother you! So how do we accomplish that given the unfortunate state of affairs that the coercive nature of majority rule often forces us to not live that life\u2026what do we do about it? Well if you\u2019re expecting Thoreau to say to grab your pitchforks and head down to city hall\u2026you got another thing coming. In fact, he doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s your duty to actively lobby for change much at all. \u201cIt is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too.\u201d So Thoreau\u2019s position here is even more nuanced than just \u201cstand up for what you believe in and write a letter to your congressman!\u201d No, he makes it really clear at multiple points in Civil Disobedience\u2026look I have a lot of other stuff to do\u2026I didn\u2019t come into this world to make this a good place to live in\u2026but simply just to live in the world as an individual\u2026whether thats a good place or a bad place. So the question then becomes, if it happens to be a bad place when you\u2019re here\u2026how can the individual still continue to live freely and deliberately\u2026 without having to feel morally guilty by association to all of these bad things going on? Thoreau\u2019s answer to this question is Civil Disobedience. He asks a really interesting question at the beginning of the book: why do we necessarily need to have the government meddling in issues of morality? Look the government has a lot of stuff on their plate in addition to having to be the moral arbiter of the United States Thoreau would say\u2026they gotta fix our crumbling roads and bridges\u2026they have to collect taxes\u2026why not give them a break? Better question is: why is the government in the business of legislating morality? The government\u2019s great at doing some stuff\u2026maybe not so much when it comes to morality. Thoreau seems to think that the government \u201chas not the vitality and force of a single living man.\u201d No the individual is central to any progression\u2026and this centrality of the individual is one of the most profound ideas he\u2019d ever give us: in the same way if you\u2019re feeling really bad on the inside\u2026the solution is going to come from you as an individual, not some outside intervention\u2026so too in issues of morality\u2026it\u2019s the INDIVIDUAL that is central to reform\u2026not government intervention or coercion. Best thing we can do?\u2026to Thoreau? Non-violent protest. Now living in an age where we\u2019ve seen non violent protest play out so seamlessly over the years\u2026it may be tough to put ourselves in the shoes of the people living back then where it wasn\u2019t an obvious option that they could go to in times of political strife\u2026but really\u2026during this time and overwhelmingly throughout human history\u2026the torch and pitchfork approach was the go to method if you wanted to get something done. Here\u2019s Thoreau offering a different solution. For example, Thoreau lived during the generation that gave rise to the Mexican-American war\u2026now it was commonly seen at the time that this was a war not based on any sort of moral foundation\u2026it wasn't a necessary war\u2026it was a war waged for the economic expediency that came along with the eventual expansion of slave trading to a larger territory. Now if you\u2019re Thoreau\u2026staunch opponent to slavery\u2026how can you in good conscience pay taxes and support a system that is taking those tax dollars and waging a war that is nurturing the positive growth of slavery as an institution? Well you can\u2019t. So Thoreau\u2026didn\u2019t. He stopped paying taxes in protest of the state getting involved in issues of morality that he thought it really had no business being a part of. The beauty of this is that if enough people follow suit, the state no longer has the resources to fund the Mexican-American war. Now the significance of this is: for this change to come\u2026no one had to bomb city hall or punch anyone in the face or worst of all\u2026start a hashtag\u2026no this civil disobedience has brought about a \u201cpeaceable revolution\u201d. Yeah, Thoreau went to jail for not paying his taxes, but he didn\u2019t see that as being so much of a bad thing. In fact, he saw it as the only way to truly be an individual. Sure he could\u2019ve pouted\u2026paid his taxes\u2026complained to everyone around him\u2026publicly attacked the leadership of the war\u2026but he\u2019d be doing all of this\u2026all the while he would be monetarily contributing to a system that didn\u2019t correspond with his conscience. It\u2019s really interesting as we talk about these different economic models and systems of government\u2026no question we\u2019ve talked about at least one that you don\u2019t agree with or that you think is immoral. Well try to put yourself in the shoes of Thoreau here: Thoreau\u2026in a weird way\u2026went to jail\u2026in order to be truly free. Not the other way around. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_66": {"date": "2016-6-14", "text": "Posted on June 14, 2016\nEpisode 84 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #084\u00a0on William James. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo it seems clear\u2026we live in an age of empiricism. What I mean by that is that \u2026Science at it\u2019s core is an empirical\u2026realm\u2026ultimately any experiment you\u2019re gonna do as a scientist\u2026 is going to be a PERSON \u2026looking through something like a microscope with their eyes\u2026or a person listening to wavelengths with their ears\u2026this person\u2019s going to be organizing all of this information through very feeble and really a completely arbitrary set of mental faculties that they have\u2026the hope being\u2026that having done this science experiment with our senses\u2026we\u2019ll be a little bit closer to knowing the way that things are in the universe\u2026.the truth!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe think about the truth that way\u2026the truth is this objective thing out there exterior to humans\u2026that we\u2019re trying to come into contact with\u2026the way that things actually are\u2026for example, if every human and every animal was eradicated from the planet tomorrow\u2026and no sentient being was even attempting to try to find out what the truth was\u2026it makes sense that in that universe there\u2019d still be a way that things are\u2026we\u2019re just not around at that point to try to access it. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing\u2026even if we WERE around to try to access it\u2026the chips are stacked against us\u2026We realize our senses are not the greatest tools you could ever have if you\u2019re trying to arrive at this TRUTH that\u2019s out there\u2026that\u2019s the reason we USE things like microscopes and telescopes\u2026to augment our senses and try to access this TRUTH out there. This sort of\u2026cosmic Wikipedia that is fully filled out\u2026now currently the best way we have to access this is through Science\u2026but it didn't always used to be that way\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s all grab our togas and head back to antiquity for a second. Remember Plato\u2019s dialogues? Remember hearing about Socrates accosting people in the Athenian agora begging people to help him arrive at a better idea of what justice is\u2026or what beauty is\u2026and someone who was really confident that they understood what justice was would give Socrates an answer like, \u201coh, justice is the balancing of the scales. when someone or something wrongs you and takes something away, justice concerns itself with taking something away from that other party so that the scales of justice are balanced out again.\u201d\u2026at which point socrates would execute socraticmethod.exe and would proceed to show them every exception to their rule in existence\u2026the goal being to illustrate to them that they actually DON\u2019T understand what justice is in its entirety, and that more thinking and more discussion about the subject needed to be had.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Socrates didn\u2019t just do this with everyday people\u2026he did it with his contemporary philosophers as well and if you remember, his reason for doing this\u2026for trying to arrive at the end all be all ultimate definition of the concept of\u2026for example\u2026beauty or good\u2026is that how can we ever begin philosophizing honestly about beauty\u2026if we don\u2019t even fully understand what it is were talking about? The hope was\u2026if we just have enough of these intelligent conversations with each other talking about beauty\u2026asking people for their definitions\u2026finding the exceptions\u2026refining the definitions\u2026finding exceptions to those\u2026that eventually we will have done it: we will have arrived at the true\u2026objective definition of beauty!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow if this is what you\u2019re doing\u2026the primary assumption that you\u2019re operating under is that these objective definitions of things exist at all\u2026 and what we\u2019re left with after all these years we\u2019ve been having these conversations is not a Webster\u2019s dictionary with the perfect definition of beauty in it\u2026what we\u2019re left with are common figures of speech like, \u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d We say things like\u2026each culture has their own set of ethics\u2026their own idea of what \u201cgood\u201d is to them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn other words\u2026these concepts of Beauty and Good and many others\u2026we don\u2019t think of them as nouns anymore\u2026we think of them as adjectives. We don\u2019t think of them as an objective thing we\u2019re trying to access like Socrates did back in antiquity\u2026we think of them as subjective value judgements that really just describe a particular type of experience that a human being is having in a particular moment. For example, when I say that a song is beautiful, What i\u2019m talking about is a particular way that song makes me feel\u2026a particular human experience that I\u2019m having that that song is producing in me\u2026I\u2019m not talking about it being representative of some cosmically defined beauty that I\u2019ve gained access to through pondering the concept of beauty.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: Led Zeppelin is not inherently more beautiful than Justin Bieber\u2026just as a class system is not inherently more \u201cgood\u201d than egalitarianism. How good we think egalitarianism is or how beautiful we think Justin Bieber\u2019s music is largely comes down to a very subjective judgement that we\u2019re making based on all of the prior experiences we\u2019ve had and what sort of feeling is evoked within our bodies\u2026our human experience of something.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell if you agree with the statement that beauty is in the eye of the beholder or that there is no cosmically defined \u201cgood\u201d that we can arrive at\u2026the guy we\u2019re gonna be talking about today would probably ask you the question: what if truth\u2026was the exact same way. What if truth isn\u2019t some thing out there that we should be trying to access\u2026what if truth is not a noun\u2026but an adjective we use to describe a particular type of human experience?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow on the surface this may seem pretty counterintuitive\u2026so let\u2019s give some context so we understand where this guy\u2019s coming from. This guy\u2026is william james\u2026psychologist\u2026philosopher\u20261842-1910\u2026and what william james thought is that if you look back throughout history at the different types of people and why they believe that certain things are true\u2026they can mostly be broken down into being one of two types of people. Two types of people in the world: what he calls tender minded and tough minded.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuick breakdown\u2026these two types of people often find themselves falling into very predictable categories\u2026a tough minded person is typically somebody that is skeptical\u2026placing a high priority on something being proven for it to be true\u2026a tough minded person tends to be more deterministic\u2026not believing in things like free will\u2026a tough minded person is more likely to be an Atheist\u2026they prefer to learn things through experience rather than reasoning to conclusions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow a tender minded person would be the opposite of all those\u2026a tender minded person prefers to learn about things A priori\u2026by thinking about things rather than conducting experiments\u2026a tender minded person tends to be more dogmatic\u2026more willing to accept things to be true without a strong PROOF they can point to\u2026they tend to be more religious, etc.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow historically, William James would say\u2026this has caused a great deal of tension. When you have one of these tough minded people butting heads with one of these tender minded people and they\u2019re trying to arrive at a conclusion about what the truth is\u2026not much productive conversation usually gets done\u2026they usually can\u2019t even begin having a conversation at all because they disagree so fundamentally with what makes something true\u2026how can they?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, William James thought the philosophical line of thinking known as pragmatism solved this problem and united the tender and tough minded. But before we can understand why James felt that way\u2026we have to understand what\u2019s known as the Pragmatic maxim\u2026an idea laid out initially by a friend of James\u2019 Mr. Charles Sanders Peirce\u2026and it begins like this:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeirce asks the question: what is wrong with the following statement? A diamond is actually soft, and only becomes hard when it is touched. As opposed to the diamond just always being hard regardless as to whether we\u2019re touching it\u2026What is wrong with that statement?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI mean really, how do you know that the diamond isn\u2019t soft when a human being\u2019s not touching it? How can you honestly prove that it\u2019s not? Now on the surface this may seem somewhat pedantic\u2026but it\u2019s actually a good point he\u2019s making here.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe answer to that question what\u2019s wrong with that statement\u2026is that\u2026there\u2019s NOTHING wrong with that statement\u2026nothing is FALSE about it\u2026 that\u2019s the whole point. Think about it\u2026whether you believe that the diamond was soft until you touched it\u2026or whether you believe that the diamond is hard in perpetuity\u2026absolutely nothing changes about your experience of that diamond, how others will experience that diamond, whether you\u2019re able to put that diamond into a ring as a token of submission to your significant other/overseer. Nothing changes about how we experience that diamond at all\u2026so our belief about this diamond and whether it was soft when we weren\u2019t touching it really ends up not mattering. And think about what that means\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter if you believe that an invisible leprechaun is keeping that diamond hard\u2026nothing changes about the way a human being orients themselves to it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the pragmatic maxim\u2026that the meaning of a concept\u2026is the sensory effect of its object.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWilliam James has a really famous example that I think illustrates the concept a little bit better\u2026he says pretend you are walking through the woods and you come across a beautiful little squirrel clinging to the side of a tree\u2026and it looks at you\u2026and you make eye contact\u2026and the squirrel decides to scurry around the tree clinging from the bark on the other side of the tree as though it\u2019s trying to hide from you and you say no, no squirrel\u2026i\u2019m not done with you\u2026that\u2019s a beautiful squirrel\u2026i gotta see it again\u2026so you sort of crane your neck trying to catch a glimpse of it\u2019s fluffy tail\u2026you can\u2019t see it\u2026so you begin walking in a circle around the tree trying to see it\u2026but this squirrel has a vendetta\u2026this squirrel isn\u2019t your show pony\u2026it\u2019s not gonna trot around for your viewing pleasure\u2026it decides\u2026its gonna use its psychic powers to just always know where you are and its gonna just always stay on the opposite side of the tree that you\u2019re on. But you\u2019re not going down without a fight\u2026you start running\u2026as fast as you CAN around this tree\u2026but the squirrel prevails\u2026his plan is working\u2026no matter how many times you go around\u2026you can\u2019t see the squirrel.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow here\u2019s the question: having circled the tree now four or five times\u2026would you say that you had gone AROUND the squirrel? Seems like there\u2019s two ways you can think about it: you could say\u2026yes\u2026I\u2019ve gone around the tree\u2026the squirrel is in between me and the tree\u2026of course i\u2019ve gone around the squirrel i just didn't see it\u2026or you could say\u2026no\u2026i didn\u2019t go around the squirrel it\u2019s face was always facing me the whole time. What would you say?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell just like the diamond example\u2026whether you think you DID go around the squirrel or DIDN\u2019T go around the squirrel\u2026neither of these accounts about what happened are actually \u201cfalse statements\u201d\u2026 it really just comes down to how you define \u201cgoing around\u201d the squirrel\u2026if going around means passing to the north south east and west of the squirrel then yes we\u2019ve gone around the squirrel\u2026but if it means passing in front of, to the left right and then behind the squirrel\u2026then no we haven\u2019t gone around the squirrel.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPoint is: whether you believe you went around the squirrel or not\u2026nothing changes about what actually happened in reality\u2026you\u2019re still having the same human experience of that event. William James thought this goes beyond just vindictive squirrels in the middle of the woods\u2026us not understanding the practical definitions the other person is using for certain arguments leads us to disagree with people that actually agree with us about what is going on in reality. He said that so many of the disagreements that we have in philosophy or any of the natural sciences\u2026are not really disagreements about reality, but debates about the specific words that are being used.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow this leads us to the question: what IS reality? what IS truth? And if you were having this conversation with William James\u2026he\u2019d probably start by saying ok, let\u2019s talk about this popular concept of objective truth\u2026let\u2019s establish a baseline here: no one listening to this actually believes in things because they think they are objectively true facts about the universe.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEven if you fancy yourself one of those skeptical, atheistic, tough minded people guided by the evidence and the evidence alone\u2026even if you were the most tough minded person ever and you only believe in the most unbiased, repeatable, triple checked scientific synopsis of the way that things are\u2026you still know that one day many of the things that you believe are gonna be replaced by better science\u2026just look at history\u2026the one constant of science is that it keeps improving upon itself\u2026so in the sense that you don\u2019t believe in things because you think they\u2019re objective truths about the universe, but really just the closest facsimile of that truth available to you during the years you are alive\u2026really you believe in the stuff you do because you see it as the most useful set of beliefs a person can have\u2026it really has nothing to do with whether they\u2019re\u00a0 actually true or not. And as better science comes out and disproves one of your beliefs and gives you a more useful belief\u2026one a little bit closer to that truth hopefully\u2026you\u2019ll adjust your beliefs accordingly and believe in THAT useful belief.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is what leads william James to make the claim that how truthful an idea is\u2026comes down to how useful it is\u2026or whether it serves the function its meant to serve. He says\u2026much like our belief about whether we actually went around the evil squirrel or not\u2026if we have a belief that doesn\u2019t contradict what we already know\u2026and it serves the purpose of explaining the way that things are and predicts things well that are going to happen in the future\u2026there\u2019s no reason NOT to consider it to be true. Again, think of truth NOT as a noun like Socrates did, but as an adjective describing a certain human experience that we have.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrue ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. False ideas are those we cannot. That is the practical difference it makes to us to have true ideas; that therefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known as.\n\nThe truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process, the process namely of verifying itself, its verification. Its validity is the process of its validation. \u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo an idea is a \u201ctrue\u201d idea if it serves the purpose of giving us a particular useful human experience\u2026just as a piece of artwork is \u201cbeautiful\u201d if it serves the purpose of giving us a particular type of human experience. Now a common question people ask here is: okay, I\u2019m on board with you when it comes to the inevitable progression of science\u2026but what about things that are just true by virtue of definition. Like that a triangle has three sides or that all bachelors are unmarried\u2026can\u2019t you say that these statements are just\u2026true statements\u2026objectively? You don\u2019t really need someone to have a useful human experience to be able to define these as true\u2026William James would say\u2026Those aren\u2019t \u201ctrue\u201d statements\u2026they simply just are the case.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a really interesting part of James\u2019s philosophy\u2026remember what were talking about whenever were talking about truth. What William James would say is that whenever we\u2019re talking about something being true\u2026all that we can EVER be talking about is our human experience of some thing. Now, you may say well all he\u2019s doing there is switching the definition of truth! But it starts to make a lot more sense when you look at this connection he thinks there is between belief and what he considers a true idea to be.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo for an idea to be true it needs to be useful\u2026and for an idea to be useful\u2026you actually have to believe in it. I mean, if you don\u2019t believe that the big bang was the event that marked the inception of the universe\u2026how can it ever be an adequate or useful explanation to you? His point there is: you BELIEVING that something is true\u2026is a huge factor in determining whether it\u2019s actually going to be useful to you or not. He gives an example of someone lost in the woods\u2026they have no idea where they are\u2026the only thing they really have to go on is this path that they\u2019re following. Now at this point that person can believe in a couple things, they can believe that the path is going to lead them back to safety and civilization\u2026or they can believe the path is leading them deeper and deeper into the woods making their situation worse.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow William James would ask: think of how your beliefs determine the outcome of that situation. On one hand, if you believe that the trail is leading you deeper into the woods getting you more lost\u2026why follow it? Why not do nothing or walk in another random direction\u2026the USEFUL way to use that belief is to not follow the trail. Maybe you stay lost out there for days and eventually starve to death. Now on the other hand\u2026if you believe that the trail is going to lead you back to safety\u2026think about it: just as we hold beliefs about science that are incredibly useful to us and we consider them to be true\u2026even though in reality we\u2019re \u201cfiguratively speaking\u201d effectively\u2026lost in the woods our whole life\u2026by believing that those scientifically founded beliefs are accurate\u2026by believing that the path leads to safety\u2026it becomes useful and therefore becomes true to William James.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is his basis for the quote: \u201cAct as if what you do makes a difference. It does.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow let\u2019s clear some things up because I already know what many of you are saying: so no matter WHAT I believe\u2026no matter what idea I can come up with\u2026as long as I act on it and it becomes useful to me\u2026it\u2019s therefore is true?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, no\u2026 there are certain criteria that William James thinks need to be met by any belief for it to be considered justifiable\u2026let\u2019s talk about them\u2026one\u2026is that there needs to be evidence in its favor. there needs to be some discernible thing that you can point to as evidence of why this is a reasonable idea\u2026but James would say more realistically this usually manifests itself as\u2026the majority of the evidence available to you during your time needs to indicate that it is true\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nTwo\u2026the idea needs to be strong enough to be able to stand up to counterarguments. What he means is\u2026If someone can just walk up to you, criticize the idea and leave you speechless in terms of an explanation\u2026it\u2019s probably not passing the test.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThree\u2026once you believe in the idea\u2026the idea isn\u2019t just\u2026 off the hook at that point. It needs to keep proving its worth as something that is useful to you\u2026and part of doing that is consistently predicting future results\u2026if its not doing that\u2026James Would say probably time to believe in something else that\u2019s a little more useful.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, the great thing about these three criteria, is that they account for both types of people\u2026the tender minded AND the tough minded. They account for all different time periods\u2026for people living in today\u2019s world or people living in medieval superstition. For example if you were living in Western Europe in the 1400s and you believed it to be true that the earth is flat\u2026William James would say that even though we know now that it\u2019s a sphere\u2026your belief that the earth was flat was a true belief back then because remember, truth is an adjective describing a specific type of human experience\u2026 the experience someone had with that belief back in the 1400\u2019s is the same as the experience we have today with the idea that the earth is a sphere.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust to make this more clear\u2026let\u2019s look at this example through the lens all three criteria so we can see how similar our experiences really are.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst criteria we need\u2026evidence it is true.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, just as we would point to something like satellite imagery that shows that the earth is a sphere\u2026someone in the 1400\u2019s would point to the\u2026you know\u2026 eye witness testimony from the guy with a peg leg that saw an entire ship of noble fishermen get sucked down to davy jones\u2019s locker. He swears it happened\u2026he even saw it with his good eye! Nobody\u2026second guesses his good eye.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecond criteria\u2026the idea needs to able to withstand criticism.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo\u2026In today\u2019s world, if someone came up to you and offered a counter argument and said something like\u2026well if the earth is so round\u2026why does the horizon look flat no matter how high up you go? We could no doubt argue back and talk about how things appear to the human eye and fixtures in the landscape only made possible by the curvature of the earth\u2026our idea that the earth is a sphere is going to be able to withstand criticism\u2026just as the average person in the 1400\u2019s probably isn\u2019t going to be running into many people like Sir Isaac Newton that is able to provide a compelling argument that refutes their belief that the earth is flat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThird criteria\u2026 the idea needs to continue to help you predict future outcomes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo\u2026In today\u2019s world\u2026our idea that the earth is spherical would continue to be reinforced\u2026right?\u2026 we\u2019d continue to compensate for the spherical shape of the earth\u2026we\u2019d continue to adjust flight patterns in the interest of saving time by taking advantage of the shape of the earth\u2026and we would continue to reap rewards from doing that. Just as\u2026Back in the 1400\u2019s they would continue to hear stories about people falling off the edge of the earth, they\u2019d continue to predict that those crazy people that are going on that super long voyage near the edge of the earth\u2026yeah they\u2019re probably not coming back. And when they didn\u2019t it would serve as confirmation that what they believe is true.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPoint is: just like with the squirrel\u2026just like with the diamond\u2026our human experience of our belief that the earth is a sphere\u2026how useful it is to us, how well it predicts future outcomes that are relevant to us\u2026we have the same experience with our belief that the earth is a sphere\u2026that someone back in the 1400\u2019s would have with their belief that the earth is flat! And to William James, both of these beliefs would be worthy of the adjective true when describing them, given their respective contexts and how they allow people to orient themselves to the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou know\u2026many people take issue with James because they think he\u2019s being far too tolerant of these beliefs like\u2026the earth is flat. We shouldn\u2019t allow that to be called true\u2026but keep in mind\u2026this is entirely contingent upon them living in a different time when other evidence was unavailable. He would no doubt take issue with that belief in today\u2019s world given how it doesn\u2019t stand up to his three criteria\u2026and in that sense he is FAR from tolerant of people just believing in whatever they want. By the way\u2026that extends on to you as well\u2026once a more useful, for most of us more accurate, interpretation of some subject comes out\u2026if your beliefs no longer hold up to scrutiny\u2026he would be equally as abrasive to your beliefs as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe the best thing to reiterate at this point is that William James sees truth not as something inside of objects themselves, but our experience of how we orient ourselves to things in the world. You know, he wrote a book called the varieties of religious experience where he dissects\u2026basically every type of religious idea that people can have and tries to find similarities between them\u2026and the interesting thing is\u2026William James doesn\u2019t think of religion the same way many of us do\u2026he doesn\u2019t think religion is limited to only things like Christianity\u2026Hinduism\u2026Orphism\u2026no William James thinks that ANY fundamentalist interpretation of life should be considered a religion\u2026because it\u2019s ultimately the same type of thinking going on.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat could include any number of things\u2026unbridled nationalism\u2026racism\u2026sexism\u2026religion to William James is better described as, \u201cman\u2019s total reaction upon life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a great quote in the introduction of the book:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe must therefore, from the experiential point of view, call these godless or quasi-godless creeds \u2018religions\u2019; and accordingly when in our definition of religion we speak of the individual\u2019s relation to \u2018what he considers the divine,\u2019 we must interpret the term \u2018divine\u2019 very broadly, as denoting any object that is godlike, whether it be a concrete deity or not.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBeautifully worded\u2026obviously what he\u2019s saying here is look: just because someone\u2019s simplified way they look at things doesn\u2019t have a ten headed deity with horns involved, don\u2019t think that the \u201cdivine\u201d qualities many traditional religions place on that thing are incapable of being conferred onto something like\u2026you know the founding fathers\u2026or David Duke.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the way real quick\u2026i realize there\u2019s people alive today that strongly believe that the earth is flat\u2026and they have tons of evidence to support why that has to be the case. I\u2019d just like to ask for you to be understanding of me having to find an example for this episode\u2026you must realize you\u2019re part of a small handful of intellectual elites that have watched the same YouTube videos you have\u2026and you certainly must realize that the vast, vast majority of us listening to this episode are uneducated sheep that are victims of propaganda. The point was not to continue my covert shilling for the CIA\u2026it was to try my best to explain some William James. By the way, if you\u2019re out there\u2026please reach out to me! I really want to know why all the governments of the world benefit from concealing that the earth is flat.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyway, thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_67": {"date": "2016-6-21", "text": "Posted on June 21, 2016\nEpisode 85 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #085\u00a0on Peter Singer. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo I want us all to imagine something. Imagine you went out to dinner with your friends or family. Imagine you had a good time\u2026it was a good meal\u2026the staff of the restaurant only sung happy happy birthday to seven people around you on this particular occasion. And as you exiting the restaurant and you\u2019re heading out to your car you hear a sound and you look over to your right and you\u2019re shocked to see a little girl\u2026maybe four\u2026five years old\u2026lying in the gutter\u2026crying\u2026bleeding out of her head\u2026looks terrified\u2026you look around nobodies helping\u2026she doesn\u2019t seem to have any parents around.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop and help the girl? Or would you look at her\u2026continue walking to your car and just go on about your day? I think somewhere around 99% of people would say that they would stop and help the girl.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow\u2026new situation\u2026imagine instead you were watching this on the news\u2026there\u2019s a story about a four year old girl that died in front of a restaurant and they were showing security footage of 10\u202620 people coming out of the restaurant\u2026looking at this little girl lying in the gutter who could be dying\u2026and they just kinda shrug say oh well and keep going to their car.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat would you think of those people? Well again, I think most of us would say\u2026how could they possibly do that? More than that\u2026how could you possibly live with yourself for the rest of your life knowing that you COULD have saved this little girl\u2019s life\u2026you COULD have done something about it\u2026but instead you decided to just turn a blind eye and go on about your day? What was so important that a human life couldn\u2019t be saved?\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter Singer points out: we currently live in a world where 6.9 million children die a year of completely preventable, poverty related causes. That boils down to about 19,000 children every single day. We currently live in a world where each and every one of the people that were negatively judging those other people walking past the little girl dying on the news\u2026have resources AND access to charities that could decrease that number\u2026yet they choose not to. Now given that we\u2019ve already established that we care about the cause of children dying when we could have done something about it, why are we so willing to help the girl in front of the restaurant and simultaneously so willing to turn a blind eye to the millions dying a year when we could do something about it?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe the best place to start\u2026maybe the place Peter Singer would start\u2026is to congratulate you. Peter Singer would like to personally congratulate you on winning the lottery. You know its funny whenever you see people in the United States lining up down the block\u2026waiting to get their powerball ticket because its up to 1.7 trillion dollars or whatever it is\u2026its surpassed the national debt and these people are trying to see if their piece of paper will win! But just think about what they\u2019re doing\u2026they\u2019re essentially asking the universe to let them win the lottery twice in one lifetime\u2026because I got news for you\u2026for reasons we\u2019ve talked about all throughout the history of this show\u2026if you\u2019re born into modern western civilization\u2026in relation to every other human being that has walked the face of the planet\u2026you have already won the lottery. The efficiency your money commands\u2026the amount of money you get paid for the job that you do\u2026the benefits you have\u2026the access to fresh food, water, entertainment, healthcare\u2026of course every ONE of these things could be better, but from a historical context you are the sultan of bernai.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAh yes\u2026modern civilization is pretty great. It\u2019s become almost an inexorable fact of life that you go to work\u2026you make money\u2026you bring it home and then you use it buy things that you don\u2019t necessarily need. Just think of how AMAZING that is! Think of the scarcity that\u2019s haunted practically every generation of human being that has ever lived\u2026We\u2019re not tribespeople anymore\u2026we\u2019re not peasants trying to scrape by enough to barely feed ourselves with\u2026every single person listening to this right now buys stuff\u2026they do no need. Let me tell you\u2026as someone that was homeless at the age of nine\u2026living off of bread for three months of my life before child protective services came and got me\u2026you COULD be spending less than you do. And that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person! That\u2019s the point! Peter Singer thinks this is actually a really exciting thing!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThink of the opportunity that you have\u2026 that no other human in the history of the world has ever had! You have the resources at your disposal to save lives! Maybe a key point to mention is that we should all understand\u2026that there is a direct relationship between the resources you have at your disposal and your moral culpability in situations you find yourself in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example\u2026imagine there\u2019s a person drowning in a lake. Now let\u2019s say you\u2019re wearing clothes\u2026not that strange of a situation to imagine\u2026you COULD take off your shirt\u2026hold the shirt out to the person in the water and pull them to safety.\u00a0 OR you could stand there and watch them drown\u2026because that\u2019s your favorite shirt. You just saw them over there eating Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos\u2026you\u2019re not gonna let them get their greasy red fingers all over your favorite shirt! They don\u2019t even make this shirt anymore!\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow a lot of people there would say that you were wrong for not sacrificing your shirt to save a human life\u2026now imagine you\u2019re in the exact same situation except now you\u2019re a member of some nudist brigade\u2026nobodies gonna say you did anything wrong\u2026you didn\u2019t have a T-shirt that you could sacrifice in the first place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is an example of how the resources at our disposal sometimes change whether we\u2019re seen as morally reprehensible. Now you might be thinking this isn\u2019t fair\u2026I didn\u2019t actually DO anything.\u00a0 Sure, I didn\u2019t donate\u2026but it\u2019s not like I karate chopped one of these starving kids in the neck\u2026in fact I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026how can you say I\u2019m a bad person when I really haven\u2019t done\u2026anything\u2026on either side of the issue.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell in the words of Peter Singer, being a good person or leading an ethical life\u2026is not only about staying away from the \u201cthou shalt nots\u201d\u2026sometimes there are things that we are morally obligated to act on\u2026the \u201cthou\u2026shalts\u201d I guess. And there is a direct relationship between the resources at your disposal and how many of these thou shalts we have to consider during our time on this planet\u2026and this really shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise\u2026I mean, on episode 59 of this show called Categorical Trolley Cars we talk about the famous ethical dilemma where a train is barreling down the tracks towards five people\u2026all of them are going to die\u2026the only way to save them is to pull a lever that would switch the train onto a different track where only one person is going to die. The question is: do you pull the lever to save the five over the one.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell think of the lever in that ethical dilemma as resources at your disposal. Fact is, if you didn\u2019t HAVE a lever that could switch the train onto a different track\u2026you wouldn\u2019t be at a moral decision point..you\u2019d just be some weird person that hangs around train tracks and likes to watch people die.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe fact that you have the resource of the lever\u2026changes everything. It gives you more potential choices to pick from on the multiple choice choose your own ending book of living an ethical life. Peter Singer would say that inaction does not absolve you of all guilt. No, by choosing NOT to pull the lever\u2026by choosing NOT to use resources at your disposal\u2026you\u2019re still making a choice. And you\u2019d have to ask yourself\u2026as someone who\u2019s already established themselves as a person who cares about the child dying in front of the restaurant\u2026someone who cares to the extent that they feel it would be wrong NOT to intervene\u2026someone who certainly wouldn\u2019t give someone a free pass if they said what? I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026I just walked past the kid to my car! You\u2019d have to ask yourself\u2026why aren\u2019t we giving more to these causes? Is it just because they\u2019re far away from us and we don\u2019t have to look the suffering in the eyes ourselves?\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter Singer talks about a sprightly young chap named Toby Ord. Toby Ord was a graduate student in philosophy at Oxford when he asked himself this question. He calculated how much money he needed to live comfortably\u2026about 18000 pounds a year..and subtracted that from the total amount of money he was going to make over the course of his career\u2026and what he realized was that on top of living a totally comfortable lifestyle..he could also give enough back to cure roughly 80,000 people of blindness in countries rife with poverty. There\u2019s a bacterial infection called trachoma\u2026gets under your eyelids\u2026pus starts oozing out\u2026gross\u2026point is\u2026it\u2019s completely treatable\u2026costs about 40 bucks to do, but if you don\u2019t treat it fast enough\u2026you go blind. Blind for the rest of your life because you didn\u2019t have 40 dollars. Estimates are that around 6 million people have gone blind from trachoma\u2026and this is the cause Toby Ord wanted to do the most he could to help.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow Peter Singer would say\u2026sure it\u2019s great that Toby Ord wanted to give so much, but we don\u2019t all have to give MASSIVE portions of our income to be able to make a difference\u2026we don\u2019t all have to be Toby Ords. In Peter Singer\u2019s book: The Most Good You Can Do\u2026he advocates 10%. Most churches ask you to donate 10% of your income\u2026for most people it\u2019s not a life ending amount of money to give\u2026but it IS a life SAVING amount of money to give. Plus think of where that money is going\u2026if you give it to your church\u2026what are they gonna do with it\u2026fix up the rec room? Maybe print up more of those glossy colorful pamphlets they like to leave on everyone\u2019s front door step? No question they\u2019re using it for the most good they can, but that money would accomplish SO MUCH MORE in Africa than it ever could in the United States. What he\u2019s saying is\u2026It\u2019s not enough just to give to charity\u2026we have to be smart about it\u2026we have to use our capacity to reason to find not just where our resources will help, but where our resources will do the most good they possibly can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the \u201ceffective\u201d part of effective altruism\u2026and it\u2019s extremely important. We all have known somebody that meant well and they really wanted to try to help someone\u2026but the stuff they did to try to help ended up doing more harm than good\u2026we can all imagine someone who has great intentions\u2026tons of heart\u2026they feel so strongly for a cause\u2026but if they don\u2019t think through what they\u2019re going to do\u2026they\u2019re just this big bundle of emotions with zero direction. If you feel like donating money to try to make the world a better place\u2026instead of donating it to your alma mater\u2026or to the church down the street so they can buy more lemon cookies for fellowship\u2026Peter Singer\u2019s saying use that ability to reason to find where the money is going to do the most good it can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething interesting that struck me as I was reading this is that this commitment to use that capacity to reason to find how you can effectively do the most good possible for a cause that you care about\u2026it extends beyond just the resource of money and the cause of eliminating poverty. Like, I realize I\u2019m not\u2026you know\u2026curing the blind in Africa\u2026but as you guys know I think philosophical thinking is a very important thing to spread around in the world\u2026i think there\u2019s nothing that affects everything quite like philosophy\u2026it\u2019s a cause I care about a lot.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow I\u2019m not getting rich doing this show, I love doing it\u2026and about a year into doing the show I had a pretty strong influx of people that were telling me\u2026people I respected\u2026that I obviously like to explain things\u2026why don\u2019t I go back and get my teaching certification\u2026would take two years\u2026and quit the show and go be a teacher somewhere\u2026maybe I could work my way up to that prestigious job at a community college I\u2019ve always wanted! Their point was\u2026I\u2019d be making a lot more money teaching at a college\u2026not to mention the wonders it would do on my self esteem to be able to have people groveling at my feet for a grade. I could walk around with a sense of entitlement on campus\u2026it\u2019d be great!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd I gotta be honest I thought about it a lot\u2026but then I thought of something and I haven\u2019t thought about it since. Yeah, professors make a lot more money\u2026but they also charge their students tuition, which is extremely limiting. This podcast is free. How many people am I going to be spreading this message to as a teacher? 200 students in a class\u20265 classes? What 1000 people a semester? 1000 people download this show in an hour. Point is\u2026much like Peter Singer talking about reasoning to the way of contributing to a cause that you care about that\u2019s going to do the most good\u2026this show is a much more effective way of getting this message that I care about so much out to as many people as possible. I guess I just want to make the point that whatever cause you care about, personally, is there a way you might be able to sacrifice a little bit of personal comfort in the name of doing the most good you can do.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOk so we\u2019ve established that we care about the dying little girl\u2026we\u2019ve established we WOULD intervene and morally condemn others who did NOT choose to intervene\u2026we\u2019ve established that we DO in fact have at least a dollar that we COULD give and that inaction is not a get out of jail free card. We\u2019ve established all that and yet\u2026I\u2019m gonna guess\u2026there probably are tons of people out there still listening to this that really want to disagree with Peter Singer. A lot of people feel attacked\u2026and it\u2019s easy to understand where they\u2019re coming from.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not a bad person\u2026I volunteer down at the food bank\u2026this old lady dropped her change purse the other day\u2026I picked it up and gave it back to her\u2026I don\u2019t FEEL like a bad person\u2026yet here I am Peter Singer being told by you that I\u2019m doing something wrong! This sort of dynamic is a perfect recipe if you want to get people to come up with arguments for why they act the way they do that aren\u2019t necessarily philosophically sound\u2026but are attempts at trying to justify the way they already behave. You see this same sort of behavior when you talk to people about why they treat their significant other the way they do like in our insecurity episode\u2026when you talk to people about the reasons they give for why killing animals for food is morally justifiable\u2026and unsurprisingly another area that Peter Singer specializes in: the life of an effective altruist in today\u2019s extremely unique world. Now because of this dynamic\u2026he spends most of the works that he\u2019s done on this subject answering common questions and counterarguments that people commonly throw his way whenever he has conversations about it. So let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common ones\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne argument that always seems to come up is\u2026alright Peter Singer\u2026you care about the children? Do you REALLY care about the children? Well I think if you honestly cared about them\u2026you wouldn\u2019t spend your time writing books about how everyone else should be helping them\u2026you\u2019d quit your job as a philosopher and go down there yourself and provide aid to these people. And on that same note\u2026where do we draw the line? Let\u2019s say I really feel compelled now to help end global poverty\u2026can there be too much of a good thing? Why shouldn\u2019t I conclude that I too should uproot me and my family\u2019s life and move somewhere where I can constantly help? The core thinking here being that if I want to help out with a particular cause\u2026the MOST good I could ever do is to be something like a Mother Theresa dedicating every second that I have.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt this point Peter Singer would probably direct your attention back to that amazing and very unique life that you were born into\u2026 and he\u2019d say\u2026that because of the tools you have at your disposal\u2026you can really do the MOST good\u2026by just being a highly productive citizen living in the United States.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s actually people out there that are much more extreme than Peter Singer that say that we, as citizens with this sort of opportunity available to us, we have a moral obligation to work really hard towards making MORE money in our careers, so that we can give all of that additional money to these causes. Again, that\u2019s a more extreme position to take\u2026but the sentiment still remains in Peter Singer\u2019s point.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is: sure you could quit your job, move to Africa, and spend all day every day handing out sack lunches to people\u2026or you could continue living your life as you do, and eventually donate enough money for a charity to employ\u2026three aid workers\u2026five aid workers\u2026.all of which are going to do the same job you would have done, but that didn\u2019t have this unique opportunity like you do\u2026to have their skills pay for the work of multiple people.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother common argument people will come back with is: ok, so I want to help\u2026I want to sacrifice so that other people don\u2019t have to die. Why do I even need to be comfortable? Why would any comfort of modern existence ever be more important than those dollars being spent to potentially save another life? Why shouldn\u2019t I go all in and donate every penny I possibly can? Why Shouldn\u2019t I live in a box? Why shouldn\u2019t I eat once a week and in between meals crush up some rocks and water into a thick paste that serves as a benign mass inside my stomach tricking it into thinking that I am full? Why shouldn\u2019t I do that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgain, because you were born into a such a unique set of circumstances, one where you can use your opportunity to work to contribute truckloads of money to these causes\u2026it actually is counterproductive for you to not be comfortably living. It\u2019s a little bit like when they say on a plane\u2026secure your oxygen mask before you secure the mask of the child next to you. The thinking being\u2026if you're not breathing\u2026it\u2019s probably going to inhibit your oxygen mask fastening abilities. Now in the same way\u2026if you\u2019re weak and mentally foggy because you\u2019re not getting your caloric needs met, if you\u2019re sick because you get your drinking water from that communal hose on the side of your apartment complex\u2026even if you\u2019re not able to maintain a professional veneer and follow the dress code of your workplace\u2026all of these things inhibit your ability to make money to donate\u2026if in fact you wanted to truly do the most good you could possibly do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother argument that people commonly give is that, look everything you\u2019re saying is true\u2026I WANT to donate\u2026but unfortunately\u2026another thing that makes the time period I live in unique is that we live in a world where charities are often wasteful, ineffective or even downright corrupt. I wish I could give my money more directly so that it doesn\u2019t have to go through this middle man where I have no idea if the funds are actually going to the people I want to help!\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a good point. There was a poll that Peter Singer cites in his book\u202670% of Americans that give to charity do absolutely ZERO research into where the money is actually going\u2026and around 29% of that remaining thirty do a very cursory look over of things, usually looking for a single criteria to be met\u2026like what percentage of the money actually goes to the people vs. administrative costs. But even THAT statistic can be misleading\u2026even though it sounds great oh, they\u2019re giving 98% of all money to the actual people in need\u2026often times\u2026the fact that they only use 2% to cover administrative costs makes them less effective at providing the help than some other charity that used say 5%\u2026also, because they have such a low budget to operate on\u2026often times the service they\u2019re providing isn\u2019t the most effective way to help the people they want to help.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example\u2026imagine a charity that has a very low operating cost and they use 2% percent of the money to travel to places where people are dying of Malaria and give them Malaria vaccine\u2026pretty simple operation\u2026versus ANOTHER charity that sends teams of people to these communities and teaches everyone how to make their own nets that prevent mosquitos from biting them in the first place. Now, the second operation might cost a bit more to execute, but think of how much more GOOD is being done as a result of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo no question it can be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to finding what charities are actually going to be doing good, but again\u2026a hallmark of the time period that we live in is that we have access to information. There are independent groups that do nothing but audit charities\u2026exposing any waste\u2026exposing any corruption\u2026showing where every dollar goes\u2026they even give them a ranking so you can see very quickly which ones are actually doing good. Again, this goes back to the \u201ceffective\u201d part of effective altruism\u2026it\u2019s not enough to have a knee-jerk emotional response to something\u2026we need to be willing to do a little digging to find out what organization is going to do the most good with our money.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut probably THE MOST common argument that people give back when they\u2019re faced with this thought experiment about the little girl dying in front of the restaurant\u2026is that it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help\u2026for me it\u2019s the problem of: how much good can I actually do? I mean, I\u2019m not a billionaire\u2026I don\u2019t have millions of dollars to be throwing around\u2026yeah I COULD give a dollar a month five dollars a month\u2026but how much good is that actually doing?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell what if\u2026five million people had that same outlook? There\u2019s the millions of dollars that could have made a huge impact. By the way real quick\u2026I\u2019m walking proof of how big of a difference the dollar\u2026five dollar donations make. I pay my bills and survive from the one\u2026two dollars an episode that people give on Patreon\u2026so for all of you out there that didn\u2019t say, oh what good could I possibly do\u2026thank you because you make this show possible.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe same dynamic applies to people dying in developing countries. You know Peter Singer talks about how\u2026were born into a world that tells us hard work is a virtue\u2026and the paradigm that you\u2019re supposed to strive for is to make more money\u2026so that you can spend more money. You know, it\u2019s exciting when you get a raise at work or when grandma beatrice leaves you a huge inheritance because now\u2026you get to buy that nicer car you\u2019ve always wanted\u2026you get to have a bigger and better house\u2026you make more\u2026to be able to spend more. But what often happens is you find yourself on this hedonic treadmill where you\u2019re always thinking about what you\u2019re going to buy next and once you get it\u2026it\u2019s onto the NEXT thing you\u2019re going to buy\u2026and so on and so forth until you realize that the stuff is never going to bring you satisfaction\u2026the satisfaction has to come from the inside.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter Singer asks\u2026why does it have to be this way? Why, hypothetically speaking, couldn\u2019t we live in a world where we have the same idea that hard work is a virtue\u2026but instead of making more so that you can spend more\u2026you make more so that you can give more?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done\u2026you\u2019re 80 years old\u2026you\u2019re looking back on your life\u2026Peter Singer would ask you\u2026which would you rather look back on\u2026a lifetime where you made tons of money you didn\u2019t need and bought stuff you didn\u2019t need\u2026stuff that\u2019s all sitting in a landfill somewhere now\u2026or would you rather look back and say\u2026I made more money that I needed and with that money I was able to save 100,000 lives. 100,000 people are alive today that otherwise would have died\u2026and that\u2019s because of me\u2026that\u2019s because of this guy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_68": {"date": "2016-7-14", "text": "Posted on July 14, 2016\nEpisode 87 Transcript\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #087\u00a0on Albert Camus. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo as you probably know by now\u2026philosophy\u2026more specifically the more abstract, out there ideas in philosophy can be a pretty tough thing to just cannonball into and fully understand them right off the bat\u2026and I think most educators realize this\u2026and a useful tool that i think a lot of them use to sort of\u2026set up a skeleton of an idea that they can flesh out later with more of the details\u2026 is they try to take big ideas or even entire branches of philosophy and distill them down into a single sentence\u2026or a single question.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, epistemology\u2026notoriously referred to as the branch of philosophy that asks: how do we know what we know? Now, that\u2019s great as a working definition of epistemology if you need a frame of reference as you\u2019re learning about it\u2026but the more you DO learn about it the more you realize that\u2026 that\u2019s really only a fraction of what epistemology actually deals with.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMetaphysics\u2026notoriously referred to as the branch of philosophy that asks: what is everything made out of and how did it get here. Again, great definition for educational purposes, but the more you look into it the more you realize all of the metaphysics that definition is leaving out.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow the guy we\u2019re going to be talking about today, Albert Camus, he thought that he had found the most fundamental question in all of philosophy\u2026a question that he thought\u2026no matter what other philosophical question you could ever come up with\u2026it was ultimately going to be a follow up question to THIS question\u2026but the problem is if I just SAY the question\u2026uh i\u2019ve I\u2019ve found that a lot of people initially disagree with him and end up poised waiting to disagree with everything else the guys saying.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo what I wanted to do to give some context to this question\u2026just so we can better understand where Camus is coming from when he\u2019s asking it\u2026is I wanted to tell you a story from Greek Mythology about a King named Sisyphus. Sisyphus was the kinda king\u2026he wasn\u2019t really feeling the whole Pantheon of Gods thing\u2026you know the whole I\u2019m gonna rape you and then blast you all over the cosmos and make you into the big dipper\u2026no Sisyphus was known as someone all throughout his life that didn\u2019t really march to the beat of the drum of the God\u2019s so it came as no surprise when one day\u2026when it was his time to die\u2026Hades\u2026LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD came to get Sisyphus, wrap him up in chains, and suck him down into the blackened recesses of his realm.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow Sisyphus\u2026cunning as he was\u2026when death shows up to take him\u2026he starts talking to the lord of the underworld\u2026and somehow convinces him of testing the chains out on himself before he uses them on him\u2026so when death\u2019s all tied up and says yep these chains definitely seem to be in working order!\u2026Sisyphus just throws him in his closet and goes on about his business. Now as you can imagine\u2026there are some consequences when death doesn\u2019t show up to work\u2026for one thing\u2026people can\u2019t die. Throughout the myth of Sisyphus they give all kinds of examples of how people would get killed on the battlefield and still show up to dinner that night\u2026people would get like run over by a horse and just stand up and dust themselves off. Point is: the Gods soon realized what had happened. Now as you can ALSO imagine\u2026for Sisyphus\u2026kidnapping the lord of the underworld and hiding him in your closet has some serious consequences as well. So the God\u2019s sentenced him to one of the most horrible fates imaginable\u2026it\u2019s a motif we\u2019ve all probably seen at some point in our lives\u2026Sisyphus is the guy condemned by the gods to a lifetime\u2026 of rolling a boulder up a hill\u2026back breaking, grueling labor\u2026only to reach the top of the hill and have the boulder inevitably roll back down to the bottom for him to start over again. Condemned to a lifetime of pain and anguish and working hard only to have his efforts be completely futile in the end\u2026the boulder will always roll back down to the bottom of the hill.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow Camus would say\u2026what a wonderful metaphor for your life. Now I\u2019ll explain his reasoning in a second but just imagine\u2026if this is true\u2026imagine If the life you live right now is comparable to rolling a boulder up a hill only to have it inevitably fall back down again\u2026if that is true\u2026then as Albert Camus says, \u201cThere is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is the decision of whether or not to commit suicide.\u201d This is his fundamental philosophical question that I was talking about\u2026this is the question that underlies EVERYTHING else. Should we commit suicide?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow hold on at this point you might be saying\u2026alright\u2026don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just a little bit melodramatic\u2026Camus? My life isn\u2019t that bad\u2026I\u2019m not condemned by the Gods\u2026I\u2019m not rolling a boulder up a hill everyday\u2026I don\u2019t even like boulders.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell it\u2019s a metaphor\u2026Camus would say: look. we\u2019re born, we grow up, we get a job and it\u2019s so easy in this modern life for people to fall into this momentum of living the same exact day over and over again\u2026up, work, home, TV, bed, up, work, home, TV, bed, up work\u2026you get it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis isn\u2019t how human beings were meant to live\u2026it\u2019s monotonous, it\u2019s tremendously unfulfilling, it\u2019s practically devoid of anything that feels even remotely rewarding. Saddest part about it to Camus is that most people just go along with it and don\u2019t ever really question it. This is just the way life is! I\u2019ve resigned myself to a life of sleeping pills and caramel macchiatos.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut not everybody ends up this way. Camus would say if you\u2019re not one of these people that just sort of sheepishly goes along with it and never questions it\u2026well\u2026then you\u2019re one of the lucky few that get to have your very own existential crisis! Congratulations. Because what happens when you really take a look at that lifestyle\u2026that up, work, home, TV, bed\u2026lifestyle\u2026is you start to wonder if any of this stuff you\u2019re doing everyday matters at all. You start to feel isolated\u2026alienated. You start to look at death looming on the horizon, you start to wonder\u2026am I wasting this gift of life\u2026 and you can\u2019t help but feel really uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo IN an attempt to alleviate this discomfort\u2026You start to ask yourself some really tough questions\u2026questions that are trying to get some clarity about this existence: what is the purpose of my life or the universe for that matter\u2026what is the meaning\u2026is life really just me watching netflix until I go casket shopping one day?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nCamus talks about how when we find ourselves in this uncomfortable place we seem to have this longing for happiness\u2026and this appetite for clarity\u2026or an appetite for being able to make sense of everything\u2026trying to find the purpose that we serve\u2026and an extremely common place people start LOOKING for that purpose\u2026just given the last several thousand years of human thought\u2026is that they try to look for some sort of preordained cosmically prescribed meaning to it all. They look at their place within the universe and they start to ask\u2026what plan did this universe have for me? What function do I serve in the grand scheme of things?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey ask these questions and what do they get? Silence. Nothing answers you back as a human being when you ask those questions. It\u2019s not like some customer service rep from the universe call center picks up. Well Camus would say\u2026given that fact\u2026that leaves you with a very real problem on your hands\u2026\u2026Because if nobodies picking up at the call center for the universe\u2026\u2026we don't KNOW what the purpose of the universe is. We don\u2019t KNOW what our purpose is\u2026or if we even have one\u2026and what\u2019s worse is that\u2026you\u2019re just a human being. The only tools you have\u2026to arrive at the MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE\u2026are your eyes, ears\u2026you know your sensory experience\u2026and your ability to reason. That\u2019s it!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re met with silence\u2026when you ask those fundamental questions of your existence\u2026probably means your tools aren\u2019t doing the job that well. Now you can draw any number of conclusions from this\u2026a common one is that\u2026maybe we DO in fact have a purpose\u2026but TO whatever prescribed that purpose\u2026it\u2019s just not very important for us to know for certain what that purpose is\u2026or maybe\u2026if we KNEW what our purpose was\u2026it would sabotage our ability to fulfill that purpose.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example Genesis 1:28. God tells Adam rule over all the fish and fowl and every living creature that moves on the ground. Which I just realized doesn\u2019t really cover underground animals\u2026maybe moles are onto something\u2026uh\u2026point is if you believe that the purpose of every animal in the world is for us to rule over them, part of that being that God allows us to eat these creatures\u2026A cow doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s purpose\u2026and you can imagine how if that cow KNEW it\u2019s purpose\u2026it might inhibit its ability to fulfill that purpose\u2026it would be trying to stay away from us lucky humans as much as possible so it can survive. Maybe\u2026 it\u2019s the same way for human beings\u2026maybe if we were able to know for certain what our purpose was\u2026it would sabotage our ability to accomplish it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow another possibility you might arrive at when you ask these questions and are met back with silence\u2026is that maybe\u2026the universe has no meaning\u2026or even if it does\u2026maybe just because of these crude tools these eyes ears and ability to reason\u2026maybe it\u2019s impossible for you to ever discover that meaning with certainty at all.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut you know what? when you\u2019re asking these questions\u2026who really wants to believe all that? I\u2019m not gonna let some existential crisis ruin my day\u2026so you hold out hope! Maybe I DO have a purpose! After all\u2026sure I\u2019m just a human being\u2026but the flip side of that is\u2026I\u2019m just a human being\u2026who am I to make some proclamation about there being no meaning to everything in the universe. So you reserve judgement\u2026keep your eyes peeled for that meaning\u2026and go on with your life\u2026usually with a set of idealistic expectations about how the universe in gonna be treating you\u2026after all\u2026if you DO play some sort of role in the grand scheme of things\u2026easy assumption to make from there is that the universe must have some way to protect that investment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo you go on throughout your life armed with that set of exceptions keeping your eyes open!\u2026and then\u2026inevitably\u2026the universe smacks you in the face\u2026life happens\u2026your sister gets hit by a car\u2026you don\u2019t get the job that you wanted\u2026these things happen all the time. What we see as horrible tragedies\u2026lives are completely destroyed. Human suffering is visited on a scale that is hard to comprehend. When these things happen to us\u2026and they DO happen just less frequently than they otherwise would because you live in the luxury of the modern world\u2026when these things happen to us\u2026one thing seems clear in that moment\u2026whatever purpose the universe has for you\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem to insure that you\u2019re going to be financially stable\u2026or surrounded by a big family at Thanksgiving\u2026in that moment\u2026the universe seems pretty uninterested in whether you\u2019re going to be happy\u2026in that moment\u2026the universe seems pretty uninterested in you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow Camus says we find ourselves in these moments a lot\u2026especially when we\u2019re young\u2026 And because we\u2019re so desperately trying to find this cosmic meaning to our life that we swear must be out there somewhere\u2026we start to get confused and scared\u2026we start to have this inner monologue. Why is this happening to me? All of this tragedy seems to be so random\u2026I\u2019m not a bad person\u2026why are all these terrible things happening to me and this criminal over there never has anything bad happen to them\u2026maybe the way I act doesn\u2019t have any bearing at all on whether the universe allows some tragic course of events to unfold in my life. Maybe it all is just random\u2026But if that\u2019s true\u2026I still have my original question\u2026what is the meaning of my life?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow listening to that inner monologue there\u2026there\u2019s a lot of tension. Tension between expectations that person has about what SHOULD be happening to them and the reality of what actually DID happen to them. Camus would say this tension\u2026tension that he thought we all face at some point and i\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all had a similar inner monologue to the one we just heard at SOME point in our lives\u2026that tension is explained\u2026 by the contrast between the fact that you\u2019re running around searching for some cosmically determined meaning to your life that the universe is going to guarantee for you\u2026when the reality is\u2026the universe doesn\u2019t seem to have a meaning\u2026or at least if it does\u2026we don\u2019t know what it is, and it\u2019s impossible for us to know what it is\u2026at least right at this second.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat this means if this is true\u2026is that all that desire to find some cosmic meaning\u2026all of the anxiety and regret\u2026the pain you feel when you see your loved ones in pain or however the universe decides to smack you in the face at that moment\u2026that is the pain of you rolling the boulder up the hill like Sisyphus and watching the boulder tumble back down to the bottom\u2026all of your efforts for nothing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee ultimately to Camus\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter how hard you push the boulder\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter how much you agonize over trying to find that cosmic meaning\u2026eventually\u2026you\u2019re gonna die\u2026everyone you've ever known is going to die\u2026your name is gonna be forgotten\u2026Wal Mart is gonna take over the world\u2026the sun is going to inflate and explode and destroy any trace of you that could possibly be left\u2026ultimately, because you didn\u2019t choose to be born\u2026 you have been condemned to a lifetime pushing a boulder up a hill only to find out that it was all pointless. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow if this sounds pretty ridiculous\u2026this is why Camus describes this existence as \u201cabsurd\u201d. He says:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMan stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow if you\u2019re saying to yourself wow Camus thank you\u2026no no thank you for that wonderful speech\u2026you just made the whole family feel really depressed\u2026you know call me crazy Camus\u2026but I don\u2019t WANT to feel like this\u2026I don\u2019t want to feel like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill for the rest of my life for no reason! .. And he would probably say back, Yeah, No kidding\u2026NO ONE DOES. You\u2019re living in a constant state of absurdity with the universe. But whether you want to acknowledge it right now or just shove your head in the sand\u2026 the fact remains you ARE like Sisyphus\u2026and that uncomfortable feeling that you want to avoid for the rest of your life\u2026EVERYONE ELSE wants to avoid it too! And Camus would say that people have no shortage of creative ways that they\u2019ve come up with over the years\u2026to escape this state of acknowledging the way that things actually are.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow one of the go to ways that might come to mind is to just, to commit suicide. After all, if you\u2019re condemned to a life of the painful and agonizing work of pushing a boulder up a hill\u2026and you know that all that pain, effort and sacrifice isn\u2019t really leading to anything\u2026why wouldn\u2019t you just cling onto the boulder like a koala baby\u2026and uh\u2026let gravity do the rest. Certainly does solve your problem right? Well Camus would say, no it actually doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomebody that commits suicide as a response to the absurdity of the world is looking at the problem in a really misguided way. The problem is not with the fact that you\u2019re alive. The TRUE problem is with the disparity between your search for meaning and how the universe doesn\u2019t seem to have one that you can arrive at. If this is truly a problem, any solution to that problem is going to have to do with repairing that disparity. All you\u2019re really doing by committing suicide is running away from the ACTUAL problem. It\u2019s like fixing a leaky faucet by moving to a different house\u2026got news for you\u2026that things still in there drippin.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere must be a better way!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow I know what you're saying\u2026wow that was it? That was the answer to the most fundamental philosophical question? That was like three sentences! Well no. See because to Camus\u2026that is not the only way that you can commit suicide in this existence. There\u2019s another type of suicide. The one we just talked about is what he called physical suicide\u2026the other kind is what he calls philosophical suicide.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo at the risk of sounding redundant I just wanna reiterate something real quick so you can see just how similar these two types of suicide are to Camus. You find yourself in a state of the absurd\u2026the reality of this world that we live in is that you want to be able to make sense of it and find meaning in it, but you don\u2019t know that meaning, you don\u2019t know how to find that meaning and it may ultimately be either entirely meaningless or impossible for you to ever find the meaning. So when you live in that world\u2026one way to leave that world\u2026 is to commit physical suicide\u2026 but as we just talked about you don\u2019t really solve the problem\u2026the faucet is still leaking inside of your house\u2026you just live in a different house\u2026Now ANOTHER way to leave this world that doesn\u2019t really solve the problem is to commit philosophical suicide\u2026or to focus your attention on some OTHER world that doesn\u2019t actually exist\u2026a world where this anxiety and tension that comes along with the reality of this absurdity no longer exists. This is like living in a house with a leaky faucet\u2026and it\u2019s dripping all day\u2026driving you insane\u2026you can\u2019t sleep because there\u2019s this leaky faucet that\u2019s constantly dripping in your ears\u2026so instead of fixing the faucet you put in earplugs and pretend like faucets don\u2019t actually exist.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, the most obvious example of this from human history would be religion, I mean, common to most denominations at least in our modern world\u2026they literally focus their attention on another world, one devoid of anxiety, one that provides meaning to everything you do in your life\u2026 but make no mistake followers of religion are not even close to the only people guilty of philosophical suicide to Camus. Though I think it\u2019s interesting to pause on them for a second to notice something unique about Camus.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nCamus uses the word meaningless a lot\u2026but let\u2019s not misunderstand where he\u2019s coming from. Camus doesn\u2019t see himself as some sort of\u2026you know\u2026anti Thomas Aquinas\u2026who\u2019s goes into great detail and writes entire books presenting how he has a philosophical proof of how the universe has no meaning. No, he sort of comes at it from the other side\u2026he just tries to explain the reasons why there is such a huge incentive to create and confer that meaning onto the universe. That state of the absurd is a pretty horrible place\u2026if somebody\u2019s willing to PHYSICALLY commit suicide\u2026Camus would say they\u2019re DEFINITELY going to be willing to adopt some awesome meaning for their lives where they get to live forever\u2026 and then walk around with a confirmation bias.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow as I said\u2026followers of religion aren\u2019t the only people out there looking to another world to alleviate this feeling of the absurd. What I mean by another world is simply some pre-manufactured system of beliefs that doesn\u2019t really reflect THIS worlds reality\u2026it\u2019s really just an attempt to simplify the world down into terms that are easily understandable so that you don\u2019t have to contend with the true, unbridled ambiguity of it all.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis could be any number of things: nationalism, racism, sexism, your political outlook\u2026even things like watching sports or playing video games with every free second. Again, the goal of committing philosophical suicide is to sort of revel in a state of certainty that somebody else gave you\u2026a state of certainty that doesn\u2019t actually exist so that you can get rid of the uncomfortable feeling of answering those fundamental questions about your existence. Again, it\u2019s putting earplugs in and pretending like faucets don\u2019t exist\u2026and if that\u2019s a funny visual\u2026look around you\u2026most people are doing it right now.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow for Camus\u2026this runs into the same problem as physical suicide. It doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem\u2026it just deludes you into believing that you already know everything about existence. Now if you\u2019re out there saying, what\u2019s wrong with that? What\u2019s wrong with a little hope Camus?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope? Stop hoping\u2026stop looking at some other world that doesn\u2019t exist in a TV screen or a book or in your reductionist view of the way things are\u2026stop looking at that other world and start looking at this one! That hope, that constant looking to some other world robs you of so much in this one. Hope may be calming to that state of absurdity\u2026but think of the cost! It robs us of the here and now. Everything we COULD be experiencing now, but aren\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee Camus didn\u2019t think suicide was the answer to this existential crisis. Physical Suicide and Philosophical Suicide are just two ways of RUNNING from the problem\u2026but Camus thought how bout instead of RUNNING from the problem\u2026you welcome the problem with open arms\u2026you EMBRACE the problem. CHAIN yourself to the problem. Find comfort in the uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee what Camus thought people that commit philosophical suicide never understood\u2026is that not running from the absurd\u2026but facing your existence head on and acknowledging it\u2026that makes you a pretty amazing person. That\u2019s a pretty awesome accomplishment. How many other people are brave enough to do something like that? And he thinks you should think of it this way\u2026to Camus someone that is able to be aware of the absurd and not run and hide from is known to him as an absurd hero. See because to be aware of the absurd in a strange way is to be superior to it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTake the absurd head on\u2026stop hoping and looking to another world that may not ever exist and spend your time in the wealth of the here and now\u2026which seems to Camus to be sensory in nature.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nCamus talks about enjoying the little things\u2026enjoying the company of family and friends and good food and just sort of appreciating the sensory experience we were given.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo things that make you feel good. If you love spending time with your family\u2026enjoy them and appreciate them\u2026because you never know when this disinterested universe is going to take them away\u2026Enjoy your food\u2026you never know when this disinterested universe is going to throw a world wide dustbowl our way and you\u2019ll be fighting to the death for a bag of peanuts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYeah, maybe we ARE like Sisyphus\u2026maybe nothing we do will ever live on eternally and maybe all the anxiety and regret and hard work we put into this life ultimately has no meaning. But the Gods only condemned Sisyphus to push the boulder\u2026they didn\u2019t condemn him to resent the process. Camus says we should imagine Sisyphus smiling while pushing the boulder\u2026understanding the ultimate futility of his efforts, but enjoying it anyway as much as he can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a model of how we should live our lives. You don\u2019t have to hate or run away from the absurd\u2026you can embrace it and smile anyway. Imagine if you were 13 years old again and your parents grounded you for staying out too late\u2026the only reason that punishment works is because you hate the idea of being grounded, the only reason your parents use it is precisely BECAUSE you don't like it. I mean, how much sense would it make for your parents to say you're grounded\u2026go to Disneyland! It wouldn\u2019t work. Imagine enjoying every second of being grounded. Wouldn\u2019t have been that bad! This is what we have to do with the absurd\u2026push our meaningless boulder, but smile and enjoy it as much as we possibly can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow the last two episodes have been on Sartre and Camus\u2026two people that for part of their life were practically best friends and for the other part of their life were worst enemies. The next episode is going to be on one of the most famous back and forth debates in the history of the world\u2026between Sartre and Camus. Thank you for listening\u2026I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_69": {"date": "2016-10-18", "text": "Posted on October 18, 2016\nEpisode 79 Transcript\n\nWell, we\u2019re going to talk a lot about what Kierkegaard MEANS when he is saying that today\u2026but I think to understand what he\u2019s saying in its entirety\u2026it\u2019s necessary for us to look at another quote by Kierkegaard\u2026written years apart in a completely different work of his\u2026and um\u2026for the sake of it appealing to our modern ears that are accustomed to\u2026you know\u2026NOT talking like we\u2019re wearing a coon skin hat in the 1800\u2019s\u2026I\u2019m gonna paraphrase it a bit and it goes like this:\nThe biggest danger one can face in this life\u2026is losing ones self. The reason why is that it can leave you\u2026it can as he says \u201cpass off in the world\u201d without you even realzing it. Everything else you lose\u2026five bucks\u2026your wife\u2026your phone\u2026it\u2019s immediately evident to you that you\u2019ve lost it\u2026you know you\u2019re getting in your pajamas\u2026pat down your pockets and say OH NO! i left my phone at Applebees!\u2026when you lose your SELF though\u2026you could go months or even YEARS without even realizing it!\nThis is why it\u2019s a particularly nefarious situation to be in\u2026you might not even realize that you\u2019re in it\u2026see to Kierkegaard, most people living today\u2026probably in the upwards of 90% of people that are alive at any given time\u2026are not actually being true to their \u201cselves\u201d\u2026like we talked about last time\u2026a lotta people are lost\u2026a lotta people find themselves either lost in the finite\u2026you know conferring their identity onto social conventions or whatever culture happened to fall into their lap when they were born\u2026or lost in the infinite\u2026stuck in a state of analysis paralysis about the truly infinite possibilities that they can choose from and never really acting on one.\nAnd as we were talking about last time\u2026truly being a self\u2026 requires you to have the realization that\u2026 yeah there are an infinite number of things I can do, but it also requires you to actually make a choice and act on one that corresponds with who you truly are.\nSee, when we find ourselves in this balancing act between the two\u2026the finite and the infinite as Kierkegaard calls them\u2026we experience what he calls a state of \u201cdizziness\u201d\u2026 dizziness caused by the fact that we look at the sheer magnitude of possibilities we have\u2026 coupled with the fact that eventually\u2026we gotta choose one of them.\nAs you can probably imagine, our heads get filled with all of these questions\u2026we start catastrophizing\u2026what if I\u2019m wrong? what if this is a huge mistake? what if I wake up when I\u2019m 60 a retired Navy Admiral with a prosthetic hip and realize I did everything all wrong?? And this is the essence of anxiety\u2026to fear some future outcome, that we really have little control over anyway. You know Kierkegaard says:\n\u201cAnxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eyes as in the abyss\u2026anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\u201d\nSee it\u2019s really important to make this part of Kierkegaards thinking clear\u2026at the risk of sounding redundant\u2026what hes saying is that anxiety is the reaction\u2026 to the idea that you have freedom to choose from millions of options but you have to eventually choose one and act on it. Now, it\u2019s interesting\u2026this freedom that we have\u2026you\u2019d have to acknowledge as a fellow human being\u2026 it can be both a blessing and a curse\u2026. I mean, on one hand, were free hooray! we can do anything we want! on the other hand\u2026wow\u2026im free to do anything\u2026what if I make a mistake? This is like Barry Scwartz\u2019s lecture on the paradox of choice. We seem to be happier as human beings when we have LESS options rather than more. He gives the example of salad dressings in the grocery store I think.\nYou know imagine if there were only three bottles of salad dressing to choose from when you walked down the aisle at the grocery store\u2026ranch, blue cheese and bar b que. Not that anyone\u2026uses bar b que dressing. Anyway imagine if there was somebody in the world that actually used bar b que dressing\u2026they would walk down that hypothetical aisle in the grocery store and they would be pleasantly surprised to find BBQ dressing\u2026easy choice over the ranch and blue cheese to that\u2026 guy or gal.\nBut that\u2019s not the reality we live in is it. You go down the salad dressing aisle\u2026GOOD LUCK. You got BBQ, spicy BBQ, honey BBQ, mesquite BBQ, low fat BBQ, lousiana BBQ\u2026the more options you have, the harder the decision is to make and the more likely it is you\u2019re gonna go home and put your loosiana BBQ salad dressing on your salad and think\u2026maybe I should\u2019ve gotten the spicy BBQ instead. Now snap back to Kierkegaard\u2026we\u2019re not talking about salad dressings here\u2026we\u2019re talking about your LIFE\u2026and we\u2019re not talking about 10 options to choose from in the grocery store\u2026we\u2019re talking about practically and INFINITE number!\nIt\u2019s no wonder he talks about how when we find ourselves in this is a weird limbo state between freedom being really good for us and really bad for us \u2026that we might feel a little uncomfortable\u2026we might feel A LOT uncomfortable\u2026this emotional state\u2026is something that he repeatedly refers to as a state known as \u201cdread\u201d.\nNow you know I don\u2019t like to make assumptions on this show, but I\u2019m going to assume when everyone woke up this morning they didn\u2019t say to themselves\u2026you know\u2026let\u2019s be in a state of dread today\u2026yeah that sounds good\u2026no. Dread is horrible, dread is agonizing. And if we\u2019re just talking statistically here\u2026what do most human beings do when they find themselves in an incredibly uncomfortable situation? They get away from it\u2026they find a way to run from it. This is the reason many people don\u2019t exercise\u2026it\u2019s the reason many people don\u2019t have difficult but necessary conversations with people\u2026it\u2019s the reason most people to Kierkegaard desperately look for some way to avoid this tough road to becoming a self.\nNow I like to think of this whole process that Kierkegaard lays out of becoming a self as sort of a descension down a staircase. Right? We started out completely lost either in the finite or the infinite\u2026once we were made aware of that we took a step down the staircase to a state of dread\u2026and once we found ourselves in that uncomfortable situation we take another step down the staircase into a state that Kierkegaard calls \u201cdespair\u201d.\nNow, despair is where most people spend their entire lives. He says despair comes from the attempt to rid yourself OF yourself. He calls despair a \u201csickness of the spirit\u201d.\nNow maybe you believe in an incorporeal spirit that inhabits your body that is responsible for your emotional state and all sorts of other things\u2026but for the rest of you godless monsters that are just treading water on this planet until you inevitably end up in a chain gang in one of the seven circles of hell\u2026for the rest of you\u2026the word \u201cspirit\u201d doesn\u2019t have to alienate you. Think of spirit in the context of how it\u2019s often used in within casual conversation, \u201cI don\u2019t feel in good spirits today.\u201d Think of the sickness of the spirit as a disease that is afflicting your emotional state.\nAnd these words that he uses\u2026sickness\u2026disease\u2026this is really how Kierkegaard views this state of despair\u2026like a latent disease. Or actually, not a latent disease but a disease that is symptomless but still always quietly inside of you waiting to strike. It\u2019s like having herpes of the spirit.\nWe can relate this to any other undiagnosed disease. I mean, if you don\u2019t go in for your regular checkups and take an inventory of your body every once in a while\u2026you might just collapse on the ground one day and find out youve been living symptomless with cancer for the last nine months of your life\u2026find out this disease has been doing tons of damage without you even realizing it. same thing with despair to Kierkegaard.\nSee, because when you\u2019re in a state of despair it\u2019s not like you\u2019re necessarily walking around pouting like a seven year old that didn\u2019t get what they want for christmas. No, you can seem like the happiest person in the world and still have this void of despair inside of you that is just waiting to rear its ugly head.\nSee if despair is a disease, then the problem is with diagnosing the disease. Not only is the person afflicted by it often unable to even know whether they\u2019re a victim of it, but remember despair is that next stair on the staircase when you\u2019re running from that state of dread\u2026people run from that sense of dread in thousands of different ways, where do you even begin to look?\nKierkegaard has a great quote that\u2019s always stuck with me over the years:\n\u201cMost men are subjective toward themselves and objective toward all others, fightfully objective sometimes \u2013 but the task is precisely to be objective toward oneself and subjective toward all others.\u201d\nThe problem is with being sufficiently self aware and honest enough with yourself to realize what exact type of despair you\u2019ve gotten yourself locked into to avoid that state of the dizziness of anxiety and dread. There\u2019s no way we can go over all of the different kinds of despair here today, but the one type of despair that Kierkegaard thought was the most common for people to fall into is what he called \u201ca sickness of despair over something earthly\u201d.\nWe\u2019ve all seen this one before. It\u2019s essentially conflating your identity and your self worth with something external to you in the world\u2026 that you really have no control over. I can wax on forever about how Kierkegaard describes it\u2026best way to help you understand what he means is just to give you some examples.\nLet\u2019s say you come of age in the world you realize you\u2019re lost in the finite\u2026you step down the staircase into a state of anxiety and dread\u2026you run from it, step down to the next stair and you find yourself in a state of despair\u2026now, when youre in the state of despair you should be feeling intense anxiety, but to distract yourself away from this monumental task of being a true self you dedicate all of your life to swimming. You refer to yourself as a swimmer. You go down to the pool\u2026every single day and\u2026swim. You identify with this activity so much that you even say things like, \u201cman, if I got into an accident and for some reason couldn\u2019t swim any more, what am I at that point? I\u2019m nothing. I would just kill myself.\u201d\nNow let\u2019s say you get into a horrible accident at the zoo. An elephant has a seizure and falls on your legs\u2026your legs are mangled\u2026beyond repair\u2026the doctor has to amputate them. Let\u2019s say you can never swim again. How would you feel? Well you\u2019d probably feel like your life was over\u2026like a giant piece of who you were was taken from you by an epileptic elephant\u2026you\u2019d probably feel empty inside.\nBut what Kierkegaard would say is that that emptiness that you\u2019re feeling was there all along, you had just been distracting yourself away from the task of being true to yourself by attaching yourself to this earthly activity and making THAT into who you are.\nIt has echoes of the episode we did a while ago about Kant\u2019s idea of \u201cWhat is enlightenment?\u201d You know it\u2019s so easy to outsource your understanding of a particular subject to a book and just parrot lines out of it whenever that topic comes up\u2026it\u2019s so easy to outsource your morality to a pastor or your diet to a diet guru. What Kierkegaard is saying here is that it\u2019s really an alluring concept to even outsource who we are as individuals! Our values, our priorities\u2026everything that makes you\u2026you! But if we\u2019re outsourcing it to swimming or to hiking or to ping pong\u2026that\u2019s not necessarily you, right? You could just be running from the discomfort of this state of despair.\nAnother thing that Kierkegaard says might keep us in this state of despair a lot longer than we have to be is the transient nature of things that we have no control over. Example: Somebody loves their significant other\u2026immensely. They\u2019re the love of their life. They can\u2019t imagine their lives without them. They couldn\u2019t live without them. If they ever found out this person in their life met a tragic demise\u2026I would clasp the smiling cold steel of this dagger and drive it deep into my breast so as to feel at least something\u2026one last time.\nYeah, yet another example of someone avoiding this process of being a true individual. But imagine they didn\u2019t die. Imagine things were going great\u2026you felt whole inside and then you guys broke up\u2026and you felt agony\u2026you felt empty inside\u2026but then you guys got back together and you felt great again\u2026but then you broke up again and you felt empty. Kierkegaard would say that the emptiness that you feel was inside of you through the good times AND the bad, and that to be a true self requires you to contend with the anxiety and emptiness inside of you.\nIt\u2019s kind of funny. A lot of us spend tons of energy trying to not ever have to deal with this anxiety that comes along with becoming a true self, when in reality, at least to Kierkegaard\u2026feeling intense anxiety means you\u2019re on the right track.\nSee think of this staircase we\u2019ve been descending down\u2026what is the point of all of these different steps? Well it\u2019s to get away from anxiety\u2026the anxiety that you\u2019re faced with when you find yourself needing to choose from an infinite number of options and act on one of them. We\u2019ve RUN from this anxiety the whole time, but Kierkegaard thinks we should embrace it. It\u2019s a necessary part of being a human being. Ironically, as negative of a connotation as anxiety typically has associated with it, the more intense anxiety you feel about making this choice\u2026the closer you probably are to arriving at your true self.\nInstead of just outsourcing who you are to some culture you can\u2019t control or some person you can\u2019t control or whatever you\u2019re doing\u2026embrace your freedom. Kierkegaard sees the process of becoming an individual as sort of a baptism by fire; yes you will experience anxiety and dread and all of these temporary feelings\u2026but just like the discomfort you feel when you\u2019re lifting weights at the gym\u2026that adversity is a catalyst for growth.\nI know this isn\u2019t a revolutionary concept or anything, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve always viewed going out for a run or lifting weights at the gym\u2026it\u2019s directly analogous to life itself. The same way you\u2019re met with resistance and you don\u2019t want to do it and you feel like quitting but you push through it in the gym\u2026life throws you resistance\u2026life \u00a0things you don\u2019t want to do and I think because of that training\u2026 you are much less likely to quit.\nNow some of you are probably saying\u2026I\u2019m already an individual. I don\u2019t follow anyone\u2019s rules not even my own. I don\u2019t outsource my self. In fact this whole process sounds really easy\u2026who\u2019s this Kierkegaard guy talking like he\u2019s so enlightened\u2026oooh I\u2019m a self! Look at me!\nI would implore you\u2026not to undersell how difficult this is\u2026in fact Kierkegaard writes extensively about how difficult it was for him to become an individual even after he understood the process of becoming one. He said:\n\u201cWhat I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I must know\u2026what matters is to find a purpose\u2026to find a truth that is true for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die\u2026This is what my soul thirts for as the African desert thirsts for water.\u201d\nListen to that\u2026a truth that is true for me. As weird as it seems living in this millenium\u2026Kierkegaard was uncovering something here in philosophy that had gone largely unexplored up until this point in history. You know\u2026for so long in philosophy we\u2019d concerned ourselves with trying to use reason or our senses to try to find some sort of objective TRUTHS about the universe that we live in\u2026arguing the whole way about what the most reliable means of doing so is.\nBut as we\u2019ve learned over the course of 80 episodes or so is that since antiquity\u2026 no matter how brilliant of a person is trying to take on this task\u2026objective truth is a very slippery thing\u2026not only do we not know if it\u2019s possible to attain, but would we know the truth if we saw it? Would it bring us any sort of enlightenment when it comes to what it means to be a human being?\nSee a huge reason WHY Kierkegaard does so much work talking about these things like\u2026the process of how we make choices, how important it is to take action on those choices, the freedom of our will that we all possess\u2026the reason he talks about this so much is that he is rejecting the notion that Hegel had just laid out\u2026that ultimately our choices are mostly a byproduct of whereever we happened to be born within the framework of that historical process of change. Kierkegaard is trying to make the case that the choices we make are free choices, and that we need to remain vigilant in keeping an inventory of ourselves because these choices are OUR responsibility\u2026not some manifistation of something out of our control.\nAgain, what is that historical process of change other than the conglomeration of billions of individual subjective existences. This would be the first shot fired towards a target that would eventually be called \u201cexistentialism.\u201d\nThat said, if you despise me right now is the time to turn the podcast off. For everyone else I want to thank you all for the outpouring of support. I went hiking a couple days into the woods trying to emerge on the other side with some sort of new perspective or at least hopefully pushing a figurative reset button. I was just walking along, completely oblivious\u2026i\u2019m by no means a skillful hiker or somebody that understands the land\u2026and I came across this black bear\u2026it was probably 40 feet away from me and it just stared at me. And because I\u2019m a genius I didn\u2019t have bear spray or really any idea of how to deal with the situation at all\u2026so I just stared back. And it felt like time was moving in slow motion and as it was happening there was just this bird chirping\u2026singing a song\u2026like nothing was going on.\nAnyway, maybe I\u2019ll write about it in length\u2026a free audio book or something if enough people wanna hear about it but in that moment something changed for me and I don\u2019t think of myself as cured of anxiety but I had a thought that has made me not feel it since that moment. For that, for you guys and for that black bear I am grateful. Thank you for listening\u2026i\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_70": {"date": "2016-11-5", "text": "Posted on November 5, 2016\nEpisode 93 Transcript\n\nSo by now you\u2019re probably realizing something about Nietzsche\u2026you\u2019re probably realizing, if for no other reason than just cause I\u2019ve\u2026 needlessly rambled about it throughout the course of this series\u2026but what you probably realize by now is that Nietzsche\u2019s not writing his philosophy so that every single person in the world can take a little something from it\u2026he\u2019s writing his philosophy for a select few people that are actually going to try at existence\u2026he\u2019s writing it for a very small handful of people that aren\u2019t interested in FEELING like they know everything about the world\u2026but people that are actually going to try to understand things deeper than they\u2019ve been led to believe about things over the course of their life.\nI mean, at any stage of life\u2026 it\u2019s very easy to be coaxed into complacency about how you look at the world\u2026I mean I\u2019m sure we can all imagine some 45 year old person\u2026listening to some passionate 21, 22 year old person with strong, reinforced convictions about how people are and how the world works and all kinds of things\u2026and they say to themselves look, I\u2019ve been there before. I too used to think I knew everything about the world\u2026but you know what\u2026 you live a couple years longer\u2026few failed marriages later\u2026a few heated discussions at a PTA meeting\u2026you\u2019re eventually going to wake up and realize how the world ACTUALLY works. Believe me\u2026I\u2019ve been where you are before.\nWell whenever I read Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy I always feel like he\u2019s this guy that\u2019s 120 years old and he\u2019s talking to that 45 year old and he\u2019s saying you know what\u2026i\u2019ve been where you are\u2026but if you see a few more presidential elections\u2026play some badmitton down at the YMCA\u2026you watch a few more seasons of the price is right\u2026THEN you\u2019ll understand how the world actually works or maybe\u2026you\u2019ll come to terms with the fact that this whole life thing\u2026is much bigger than that, that maybe 100 years is not enough time to become as well versed in things as you want to believe you are.\nWell there are certain subjects that people like to tell themselves they\u2019ve arrived at a destination about. Some subjects are more common than others. And one of the MOST common ones\u2026is the concept\u2026 of love. We all feel like we know what love is\u2026we\u2019ve all felt it. Powerful concept\u2026love. Probably not a big surprise that so many philosophers over the years have tried to take a closer look at it and understand it. Given how good it feels to EXPERIENCE love\u2026probably not a surprise that so many people build their lives around feeling or giving or spending time with the people they love\u2026the most.\nSome people even take this to the extreme\u2026some people say\u2026that all you need\u2026is\u2026love. You know they look around them\u2026understandably\u2026and they think man\u2026there\u2019s people stealing from other people\u2026people are killing eachother\u2026cyber bullying is the pandemic scourge of our time\u2026all these philosophers try to complicate things so much it\u2019s actually very simple\u2026everyone just needs to love eachother. If only we could show everyone how great it is to love everyone around you. These people say love\u2026is some sort of panacea for all of the worlds problems. Instead of dropping nukes\u2026we should be dropping giant canisters of DVDs of When Harry Met Sally. If only the whole world understood love like I do\u2026then everything would be fixed.\nBut the way you treat somebody that you love hasn\u2019t always been the way harry treated sally. \u00a0No, the things we do in the NAME of love\u2026have changed drastically over the course of history and they can easily change in the future. I mean 100 years ago\u2026my kid may have\u2026i dont know\u2026gone down to the grocery store and bought an ice cream cone for 4/10ths of a cent without permission\u2026and when he comes home and I see all the chocolate on his face\u2026I may say to myself\u2026you know what\u2026I love this kid\u2026I love him dearly\u2026I am not going to allow him to become a person who doesn\u2019t understand the value of discipline for the rest of his life\u2026I don\u2019t want to\u2026but I have to beat him\u2026in the name of love I have to beat em.\nTons of other examples of this but the point is: the way that people treat the ones they love is highly influenced by the cultural backdrop that they were born into. St. Augustines man burning in a building comes to mind. In other words\u2026even if everyone in the world loved eachother\u2026people might still steal from people they love in the name of feeding others that they love who are starving\u2026people may still assault other people in the name of love\u2026maybe love is actually a pretty complex thing that needs to be unpacked. I mean love is far from a static thing\u2026right? We use the word love to describe any number of different emotional states\u2026we say things like I love my dog, I love my children, I love my parents, I love my domestic life partner, I love this pizza that I just ate from Chuck E Cheese\u2026.in all these contexts the same word is describing emotional states that are extremely different from eachother\u2026so what exactly do we mean when we say love? Maybe there\u2019s something similar about all of these different scenarios that we describe?\nI think when somebody says that all people need to do is love eachother\u2026 its one of those statements most philosophers would hear and say it sounds great\u2026but they probably wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a very useful synopsis when it comes to actually getting to the bottom of the cause of these problems or how to actually solve them\u2026in other words in practice, how do you get\u2026 everyone in the world to love eachother? I mean it\u2019s a little like walking into a hospital\u2026 and seeing all the different kinds of pain and suffering in a hospital\u2026you know you see people in the cardiac ward, you see a guy with a broken leg, you see someone with hypertension and you say you know what? These doctors try to complicate things all the time\u2026but in reality it\u2019s actually very simple: all these people need are drugs. All they need is drugs. Yeah, but what KIND of drugs? How high of a dose? When do they need them? Is giving them drugs really a solution or is it just temporarily masking the problem? There\u2019s more to it than just saying drugs: case closed.\nWell the point of this episode is to eventually talk about how Nietzsche sees love\u2026but I think it\u2019ll give his views some context if we take a look at some other notable philosophers throughout history and how THEY viewed love\u2026and when it comes to philosophers writing about love\u2026by far the most famous account of love ever written has to be Plato in his work the Symposium.\nNow we talked a little about this on the Plato episode, but\u2026come on\u2026that was three years ago\u2026I was horrible back then. I\u2019ll make it quick. The Symposium is a fictional book written by the Greek philosopher Plato about a dinner party\u2026where various noteworthy figures from Athens at the time meet up to talk about a particular subject\u2026apparently they DID that kind of stuff back then\u2026and the subject of this particular night\u2019s dinner party is love. Everybody takes turns getting up in front of the group giving their thoughts on love. Now, barring the funny, pretty ridiculous theory given by Aristophenes which was probably just Plato getting back at him for slandering Socrates in one of his plays\u2026besides that\u2026in terms of philosophy the book is pretty slow up until we start hearing what Socrates has to say about what he heard about love from a philosopher named Diotima.\nNow Diotima\u2026nobody knows whether she actually existed\u2026but its one of those things like: everyone else in the Symposium existed, why wouldn\u2019t this be a real person\u2026but Diotima told Socrates about how she sees love as sort of a progression. A progression\u2026ascending up rungs of a ladder\u2026where throughout your various experiences with love in your life\u2026you go through a number of phases\u2026each one of them a rung on this ladder\u2026 where you become more and more aware of what love truly is. Seeing as how this is one of the most famous accounts of love ever given, let\u2019s talk about these rungs a little.\nSo Diotima would say that when you come of age in this world and you enter into a romantic relationship of some sort\u2026the first type of love that you\u2019re going to experience\u2026the first rung on this ladder\u2026 is what she calls bodily love\u2026now\u2026bodily love\u2026is exactly what you\u2019d expect it to be\u2026a love of someone\u2019s body\u2026an infatuation with another person\u2026maybe they make you smile a lot maybe you have this uncontrollable desire to touch the person when you\u2019re around them. But, either way\u2026we all know about this one\u2026we\u2019ve all seen this one before so I won\u2019t waste your time giving examples of it\u2026but the interesting thing is that Diotima says that once you\u2019re in this place\u2026 where you love somebody for their body\u2026if you start to look closer at that feeling that you have towards this person\u2026in other words if you think about what exactly it is that you love about their body\u2026what inevitably happens is that you start to notice\u2026the things you like about this persons body\u2026 are not exclusive to them in any way\u2026there\u2019s a lot of other bodies out there that have these exact same qualities. You eventually realize there are thousands if not millions of bodies out there that you might potentially love. Now much like Socrates does\u2026where he goes into the public square\u2026asks people for their definition of courage\u2026and he looks at all of them and tries to find our what\u2019s similar about them to hopefully arive at a better understanding of what courage is\u2026maybe you take a look at all of these millions of bodies and try to find out what is similar between them\u2026and at the end of that process\u2026you\u2019re left with a certain type of person\u2026you know I like people with brown hair and blue eyes\u2026for example\u2026a type.\nBut remember this is only the first rung\u2026 on the ladder\u2026Diotima says once you get to this place THEN what happens\u2026this person whose body you\u2019re in love with\u2026well, it\u2019s inevitable\u2026you\u2019re gonna be spending a considerable amount of time with them. Eventually what you HAVE to realize\u2026is that this person is more than just a piece of meat. No, they\u2019re a person\u2026they have feelings too\u2026they have all their own thoughts, opinions, ideas\u2026eeek. Diotima says that what eventually happens after we\u2019ve had enough conversations with them about their thoughts on stuff\u2026eventually you start to realize that love is not as shallow as you first thought it was\u2026that body\u2026sure it looks good now\u2026but i dont care if you\u2019re dwayne the rock johnson\u2026in 50 years\u2026you\u2019re gonna look like a sun dried tomato out there\u2026Diotima says you realize\u2026.that there\u2019s a deeper form of love available to you by loving someone\u2019s personality\u2026or as she refers to it: the soul.\nNow it\u2019s in these first two stages that most people spend their entire lives. I mean you think about the progression of the average person\u2019s love life\u2026throughout their twenties maybe they have a few debaucherous relationships\u2026maybe they\u2019re with the wrong people personality wise but they overlook it because they think they\u2019re attractive\u2026maybe eventually they want someone more mature\u2026maybe they end up finding someone who\u2019s personality they admire and decide to get married to that person. But still\u2026 even if\u2026 you find yourself admiring something about the personality of someone you\u2019re married to\u2026when it comes to most people\u2019s relationships\u2026you still have one foot in the door of this bodily love\u2026i mean it doesn\u2019t matter if somebody has the BEST personality in the world, most people aren\u2019t going to marry them if they look like Golem from Lord of the Rings. Most people sort of settle into a mixture between what Diotima describes as this bodily love and the love of the soul.\nNow an important thing to note I think is that getting stuck in any of these rungs of the ladder for your entire life doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. Plato would say, all of this love is ultimately a good thing\u2026the question just becomes\u2026how much of a good thing do you experience throughout your life. Because what inevitably happens once you love a collection of personality traits that somebody has\u2026is that just like in the case of the bodily love\u2026you realize\u2026 that these characteristics you love about someone aren\u2019t somehow exclusive to them. No, you realize there are thousands of other people out there that embody these very same characteristics\u2026now the GREATER implication of realizing this\u2026to Diotima\u2026is that realizing this\u2026 removes this visage that has been clouding your ability to move on to the third rung of the ladder\u2026that to TRULY understand love is to understand that love is not this interpersonal exchange between two people that can ONLY exist between two people. What you realize is that what you love about this other person really has nothing to do with them as people\u2026what you love are concepts that they embody.\nNow again, to Diotima, once you realize this\u2026the next step is to realize\u2026 that person you love, wasn\u2019t born in a vaccuum. This person wasn\u2019t floated down the river Nile in a basket and raised as one of their own by a pack of hippos. This person was born into a very specific cultural context by a very specific group of people who all had ideas of their own\u2026and what you realize at this point\u2026 is that everything about this personality that you love so much really was forged by certain aspects of culture\u2026laws and institutions that cultivated these personality traits that this person embodies that you love. The ultimate point is: the next few rungs on the ladder are loving the laws and institutions that create the people or things that you love, then a love of knowledge of those laws and institutions, then a love of knowledge itself, finally culminating in a love of the Platonic form of beauty or the good itself.\nTons of interesting conversations to be had about these last three rungs but I think the most important thing that I want to repeat is that\u2026lets say you never get to the top rung of this ladder where you understand the form of beauty itself\u2026that doesn\u2019t make you a dumb person\u2026that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person\u2026Diotima\u2019s just saying that the good feelings you feel when you\u2019re experiencing love GREATLY increase with each rung that you move up on this ladder\u2026and that much like a dog\u2026when they\u2019ve gotten a little taste of human blood\u2026once they\u2019ve tasted it\u2026they can never go back to lamb and rice alpo. That once you\u2019ve tasted that forbidden fruit of the next rung on the ladder, all the other forms of love just sort of lose their appeal they\u2019re not as good as what you\u2019ve experienced. I mean I\u2019m sure we can all imagine\u2026if for your whole life you\u2019ve just loved people for their body and then you get together with some pelican looking podcaster dude\u2026and he dies in some tragic podcasting related accident\u2026after experiencing that higher level of love on this ladder, it stands to reason that having a relationship after that where it\u2019s all about the body again\u2026it would probably feel like something\u2019s missing. At least that\u2019s what I tell myself everyday.\nWell as you know if you\u2019ve listened to this podcast from the beginning\u2026is that this hierarchical conception of love laid out in the Symposium paved the way for love as it was laid out in the middle ages. That love\u2026in it\u2019s most basic flawed form\u2026 is love of the body\u2026some people even say it can\u2019t even be considered love\u2026it\u2019s actually lust. That moves onto a love of your fellow human beings, that moves onto a love of truth, all of which is inferior to the ultimate love\u2026the love of God.\nAnd this became the dominant perception for what love is for quite some time, and although there was work done on love before this: something very interesting happens to the concept of love right about the mid 18th century. More specifically, with the way that you treat somebody that you love. What happened was\u2026well, Romanticism happened. Romanticism is a cultural movement\u2026some would even say codified doctrine of ideas\u2026about the way human beings should be interacting with various aspects of the world that they live in\u2026falling underneath that umbrella of course\u2026is the way that we treat people that we love. Romanticism is often seen as a pushback to an era that came before it where there was a lot of emphasis put on reason as the way to arrive at conclusions about things. Too much reason.\nMaybe a good place to start is to say that: historically speaking\u2026being in a relationship with somebody that you love or getting married\u2026hasn\u2019t always been about\u2026what we would often call today\u2026romantic feelings that you have towards the other person. People used to get married for all KINDS of practical reasons\u2026because it was financially prudent to do so\u2026because they had a relative that could help you greatly advance your career\u2026any number of reasons. Now in today\u2019s world\u2026 if you got married to somebody simply because it was a good financial move for you\u2026people wouldn\u2019t really take too kindly to that\u2026they\u2019d tell you that you\u2019re getting married for all the wrong reasons that something\u2019s missing. Well where did that come come from? A big part of it\u2026 comes from is this movement of romanticism in the mid 1700\u2019s.\nRomanticism pushes the idea\u2026that it is possible\u2026and even expected\u2026to meet someone\u2026get to know them\u2026feel these intense, romantic feelings that you often feel in the initial stages of a relationship\u2026and you should expect this heightened emotional state to persist indefinitely all throughout the course of your lives together\u2026a life long love story, as it\u2019s often put. That the litmus test, for who you should love or who you should marry\u2026shouldn\u2019t be based on practical considerations like how good it is for your career or something like that\u2026but that these initial feelings that we have will decide for us. When you meet someone, and they make you feel this way\u2026you\u2019ve done it. You have now found your soul mate. You\u2019ve found the one and only someone for you\u2026from this point forward\u2026you and your soul mate are going to enjoy an all expenses paid vacation where every day of your lives you fall deeper and deeper in love with them with each passing day. Any boredom within the relationship, any longings for somebody else or novelty within that relationship, is not something that should be EXPECTED in a long term relationship\u2026it\u2019s a sign that the relationship is not going well\u2026its demon that\u2019s tormenting the relationship that needs to be exorcised.\nNow in many traditional conceptions of romanticism, and there\u2019s some variance here because we\u2019re talking about a very large period of time, but the general idea is that when you love someone deeply enough\u2026if you can\u2019t accept them at their worst you don\u2019t deserve them at their best\u2026that to truly love someone\u2026is to be tolerant of all of their shortcomings as people\u2026you know love is patient, love is kind, love is understanding\u2026corinthians 13.\nIf someone comes home from work and a lot of times they\u2019re in a bad mood and they\u2019re not really reciprocating the love in that moment\u2026you know what\u2026I love this person\u2026I understand this isn\u2019t the entirety of who they are I understand this isn\u2019t about me right now\u2026sure, the way they\u2019re treating me right now makes me feel bad, but I\u2019m gonna go find something else to do while they work through these emotions. Another example: if someone quits their job and pursues their dream of becoming a street performer\u2026a mime. And they go out miming the streets for three years and people just don\u2019t like their act that much\u2026you know your box is horrible. Someone might say you know what\u2026we may not have that much money\u2026and yes they could easily go back and get their other job and help out, but I don\u2019t care if we have to live in squalor for the rest of our lives at least we\u2019ll be together with these strong feelings that we have.\nWhat\u2019s intersting to think about is that many of these romantic ideas of love ask you to be TOTALLY tolerant about some things, but TOTALLY intolerant about other things. I mean if the person you love has romantic feelings for somebody else, or if they\u2019re telling you tons of things you need to change about yourself or if they\u2019re not fornicating with you on a regular basis\u2026these are all signs that the there\u2019s something seriously wrong with the relationship, not things you need to be tolerant of. Again, love should be this highly intuitive thing\u2026this feeling that you have\u2026you know you spent 6 years at the university learning to become a dentist\u2026but when it comes to asking how to love or who to love or why to love or anything like that\u2026that you\u2019ll just kind of wing it\u2026I\u2019ll figure it out\u2026remember romanticism was a movement that was the antithesis to a world where they thought we were reasoning too we much about the ways we behave\u2026no forget reasoning\u2026what really matters is how you FEEL about this person.\nLike have you ever seen the Bachelor\u2026I haven\u2019t of course\u2026but if I ever had I would have to say man\u2026look at what this show\u2019s become. Oh how the mighty have fallen. First episode. I think I could definitely fall in love with this guy. Third episode. I think I might be falling for him. 5th episode. Okay now I\u2019ve definitely started the falling process, I tripped on something, I\u2019m off balance, gravity is definitely pulling my trajectory in the downward motion but I haven\u2019t quite fallen yet\u2026what are these people even talking about? This is what you get when you fully eradicate reason from this process\u2026vague emotional states, waiting for some other vague emotional state to arise and people can\u2019t even tell you whether they\u2019re actually in them or not.\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026this isn\u2019t their fault! This is just what they\u2019ve been told to expect when it comes to finding a life long relationship by every TV show, RomCom and Disney Movie they\u2019ve ever come across from the moment they were born. Nobody should feel bad about having this expectation\u2026it\u2019s not their fault\u2026it\u2019s culture\u2019s fault. And even on that note, there\u2019s nothing wrong with bringing this expectation into your relationships\u2026I just think a lot of modern commentators would say that if you DO bring in these expectations\u2026barring a level of luck comparable to winning the lottery\u2026you\u2019re probably going to be largely dissapointed by your relationships\u2026it\u2019s such a tall order to fill. Most people are probably going to stick it out in a relationship far too long, telling themselves this person\u2019s their soul mate\u2026and then one day when it all goes up in flames they\u2019ll tell themselves well looking back\u2026the signs were there all along\u2026maybe this NEXT person\u2019s my one and only someone\u2026where\u2019s my Ryan Gosling? Either that or they\u2019ll find themselves six months in saying man\u2026I just not getting those butterflies that I used to get\u2026maybe they\u2019re not the one\u2026and they spend their whole lives looking for this 60 year love affair that might not ever come.\nNow it\u2019s because of this, that when most modern thinkers talk about love they usually start from this point in the discussion. You know one of the most famous accounts of love ever was by a guy named Arthur Schopenhaur\u2026he has this parable\u2026where he compares marriage to two porcupines trying to huddle together to keep warm\u2026and that the art of being with someone you love is trying to find the right distance where you\u2019re still keeping eachother warm, but you\u2019re not SO close that your \u00a0porcupine spikes are stabbing eachother. You know to Schopenhaur everything is about this survival oriented will to life and that when we get married and we have these romantic relationships\u2026what we\u2019re attracted to in someone else are REALLY what we see as our shortcomings\u2026the hope being\u2026that if your counterpart makes up for some of these areas that you\u2019re weaker in\u2026that those weaknesses are probably gonna be less likely to prevent you from prospering\u2026as a unit\u2026you guys are better off together.\nThis brings us to Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche\u2019s view on love has multiple layers to it, which is actually what makes it so interesting. On one hand\u2026just like he tries to do with everything else we tell ourselves we have strong convictions about\u2026love is no different\u2026he\u2019s trying to show us\u2026that when we love someone\u2026maybe we\u2019re a little more selfish than we like to give ourselves credit for\u2026but on the other hand, he\u2019s not denouncing anyone for BEING in love and he\u2019s certainly not saying that no one should BE in love.\nSee, Nietzsche\u2026as we\u2019ve talked about before\u2026huge fan of Heraclitus. Loves the idea of looking at two things that we commonly think of as opposites, and finding ways that they are actually the same thing manifesting itself in two different ways. For example, day and night. Are they opposites? Or are we talking about the same thing just in two different states.\nSame thing goes when he breaks down the psychology of love. Often times people talk about loving someone\u2026they say love is caring about someone more than you care about yourself\u2026i love this person\u2026i would sacrifice anything for them\u2026i am completely selflessly committed to this other being. Now\u2026Nietzsche would say\u2026how convenient that this person is trying so hard to paint themselves as such a selfless person\u2026you know what love TRULY is? When you look at it close enough\u2026love starts to strongly resemble greed. He says:\n\u201cGreed and love: what different feeling these two terms evoke! Nevertheless, it could be the same instinct that has two names \u2013 once deprecated by those who have, in whom the instinct has calmed down to some extent, and who are afraid for their \u2018possessions\u2019, and the other time seen from the point of view of those who are not satisfied but still thirsty, and who therefore glorify the instinct as \u2018good\u2019.\u201d\nIn other words, we love to pat ourselves on the back and tell ourselves how great we are for doing things in the name of loving this other person\u2026and we often like to think of someone who\u2019s greedy in a negative light\u2026but what if love and greed are the same instinct manifesting itself in different ways\u2026that at the root of either of these words is this instinct or this desire that some thing will be ours\u2026as he puts it \u201cto change something new into ourselves\u201d. He says love and greed\u2026these are the same thing\u2026the only difference between whether we classify it as love or as greed just comes down to how satisfied somebody is with what they already have. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a huge fan of italian sportcars\u2026and you save up and you finally get one\u2026sitting in the driveway. Somebody else comes along, maybe he likes italian sportcars too\u2026and he wants THAT italian sportcar, yours!\nLet\u2019s say there\u2019s nothing he wants more in this entire world than to have your italian sportscar sitting in his half vacant warehouse where it will live out the rest of its sportcar days with this guy. But you say \u00a0no, no, you love that car\u2026you don\u2019t want it to go anywhere. Let\u2019s say this guy doesn\u2019t give up\u2026this guys gonna write a pursuasive essay to that car begging it to come to his warehouse\u2026this guy doing whatever it takes to make it his\u2026maybe he\u2019s trying to find some way to convince the state to take your sports car away from you so he can have it\u2026not crazy to think you might feel like the guy was being a little greedy. Yet, being a lover of cars yourself\u2026if in your travels YOU came across this very same car\u2026you would certainly want it\u2026and in THAT context you\u2019d just think about how much you wanted that car as your love of cars, not as you being greedy. Replace an italian sports car with your significant other and take note of the similarities.\nNow here\u2019s the interesting part: even if we can agree upon the idea that love is greed\u2026let\u2019s just say that it is\u2026Nietzsche\u2019s not judging you for that\u2026he\u2019s not saying this makes you a bad person for loving someone. He thinks that love, just like everything else, is a will to power\u2026.and in this case\u2026love is sort of a mutually beneficial will to power\u2026when two people are in love\u2026yes to Nietzsche they are both just greedily desiring to change something new into ourselves\u2026but greed or no greed\u2026Nietzsche thinks love and friendship are some of the most amazing things life has to offer. He says you should find someone, love them, enjoy all the very real benefits of loving someone\u2026just take a closer look at why it is that you\u2019re doing these things and don\u2019t try to justify your actions with a nice sounding story that you like to tell yourself about how it\u2019s really all about this other person.\nNow, the reason I chose love as the topic of today\u2019s episode\u2026well\u2026two parts to it. One, this is a perfect example of one of these concepts that everyone has strong opinions on coming into the episode that Nietzsche tries to get us to question our deepest assumptions about. And two, this is a perfect example of one of Nietzsche\u2019s ideas that if you just heard the first line: love is greed\u2026you might be tempted to think that Nietzsche was just this empty, joyless, become powerful, take advantage of people kind of guy\u2026 but then when you understand where he\u2019s coming from, though it\u2019s still abrasive\u2026his point is alot more nuanced than you might first think.\nI think this is the reason why so many people misunderstand Nietzsche. They read a single line out of context and they make tons of sweeping generalizations about the guy as a person. This is the reason, as we talked about, why his work could so easily be distorted by his sister after his death when she was bumping elbows with Hitler and the Third Reich. But one of the most chilling passages I\u2019ve ever read from Nietzsche is not from any of his philosophy\u2026it\u2019s a line out of his autobiography. It\u2019s a line where he seems to foreshadow exactly what happened with his work after he died. He seems to predict how impactful his work was going to be. He says:\n\u201cI know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous \u2014 a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite.\u201d\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript\nComments\nLeave a comment"}, "episode_71": {"date": "2017-3-12", "text": "Posted on March 12, 2017\nEpisode 97 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #097\u00a0on Ludwig Wittgenstein. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo I want to start today by talking about a very strange ritual that all of you engage in, most of you dont even really think about it, you just do it. I\u2019ve seen you. I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut for a while but I\u2019m not going to let it destroy this family. I\u2019ve seen you pull out a piece of a dead tree\u2026get your little stick with your carbon ink in it and squiggle lines on a piece of paper trying to convey meaning. Yeah, I was in the closet. I\u2019ve heard you make sounds with your throat and mouth trying to take an idea that is up in your head and put it into the head of another person. I don\u2019t like to put labels on things..but I\u2019m going to need to refer to it as something moving forward with the episode and I think I\u2019m going to call it language.\nNow the good news is, you\u2019re in good company with all of this bizarre behavior. Practically every human being alive engages in the same ritual. In fact, practically every human being that\u2019s been alive for the last 100,000 years has made a similar choice, and just for the sake of the show today\u2026there\u2019s some important figures that fall into this class of people that have chosen to use language to communicate ideas\u2026like every philosopher we\u2019ve ever talked about on this show. Just think about how important language is\u2026whether you\u2019re Aristotle, Sir Francis Bacon, Karl Popper, whenever you are conducting philosophy, ultimately, you are a human being that is conducting philosophy from within the confines of a language.\nThink about it, It\u2019s really the only tool that we have to be able to communicate the ideas that are inside our head. Now, one thing that naturally follows from that if you\u2019re a philosopher, is you have to eventually ask yourself the question: what are these languages that we\u2019re all using? Where\u2019d they come from? Who invented them? Alexander Graham Bell? Was it Tesla that did that? More seriously: was it a philosopher king\u2026 who sat around for decades pondering and assigning meaning to each and every word\u2026 which he then compiled into a giant tome that he called webster\u2019s dictionary?\nNo, that\u2019s not how languages form. Language, and there\u2019s many theories about the origins of language but it\u2019s pretty clear it wasn\u2019t ever a philosopher king\u2026generally speaking language is this patchwork of mutually agreed upon names that a group of people sort of stumble upon\u2026 mostly to be able to communicate with each other about everyday things. You know, language is great if you want to order a double quarter pounder with cheese. It\u2019s great if you want to tell someone no I would NOT like to donate a dollar to help starving lizards in the congo. But if you\u2019re a philosopher, and you\u2019re in the business of being as clear and distinct with your ideas as possible, in the business of communicating those ideas as effectively as possible. Is this language that we use, this thing really just created by a bunch of people ordering cheeseburgers over the years a thing that is constantly being tweaked\u2026is this language necessarily capable\u2026 of perfectly describing every possible thing that can exist? Any idea a philosopher could ever have?\nSeems unlikely. Seems like language has these sort of built in limitations. Limitations that are almost certainly having a drastic effect on every philosopher\u2019s work having conveyed their ideas through it. Now in that world that philosophers operate in\u2026understanding language becomes incredibly important, and philosophers over the years realized this. And even though we haven\u2019t really talked about it much on this show\u2026there\u2019s actually been a lot of work done analyzing language. People have asked all kinds of questions\u2026fun questions\u2026in fact I\u2019m gonna give you a cheat sheet\u2026here\u2019s some good criteria if you ever want to know whether something\u2019s a good philosophical question\u2026it has to make you instantly intrigued and want to think about it, but simultaneously it has to make some average person next to you jump off the nearest bridge. Questions like: what is a word? what is a sentence? what is a proposition? what does it mean to mean something?\nWell another one of these questions that philosophers have asked over the years trying to get to the bottom of language is how do words get their definitions. Who or what assigns these definitions? What criteria do they use to know whether something is a complete definition or not? Today we\u2019re talking about Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2026and around the time he\u2019s coming of age in the world\u2026early 1900\u2019s\u2026the prevailing theory when it comes to this question of how we arrive at the definitions of words\u2026 is that the definition of a word is discovered when you understand the conditions for what\u2019s called both necessity and sufficiency. Or when you understand the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions that makes the thing whatever it is that you\u2019re talking about.\nFor example\u2026a necessary condition is some thing that needs to be present in order for a thing to be whatever it is\u2026for example\u2026a necessary condition for being a triangle\u2026 is that you must have three sides. If you don\u2019t have three sides, you\u2019re not a triangle. You\u2019re just a jealous parralelogram\u2026get some therapy. That\u2019s a necessary condition\u2026a sufficient condition\u2026 is something that is sufficient for a thing to be whatever it is, but it\u2019s not a mandatory property. For example, having an RSS feed that is posted to the podcast section of iTunes is a sufficient condition for being a podcast, but it isn\u2019t a necessary condition because somebody could easily create a podcast, upload it to Spotify, Google Play, Soundcloud but just never upload it to iTunes. So again the prevailing theory around the time Wittgenstein started doing his work was that if you understood all of the necessary and sufficient conditions of any one thing, you\u2019d be able to provide the definition of that thing.\nWell Wittgenstein didn\u2019t agree. But to understand why he didn\u2019t agree with this\u2026I think it\u2019s important to have a little context. It\u2019s important to understand how fascinated he was with mathematics.\nSo if you look at the life of Wittgenstein, very early on in his life he is fascinated with mechanical engineering\u2026actually starts going to school thinking THAT\u2019s the field he\u2019s eventually going to work in\u2026but then something happens\u2026Bertrand Russell, another philosopher, publishes a book in 1903 called The Principles of Mathematics that was so influential\u2026that it changes Wittgenstein\u2019s entire outlook on what he should be doing with his life. That\u2019s how big it was. He quits mechanical engineering\u2026transfers to Cambridge so that he can study under Bertrand Russell who was teaching there at the time.\nTrying to think of where to start. When you think about it, math is a pretty fascinating thing\u2026especially if you\u2019re a philosopher. I mean, it\u2019s not a coincidence that so many of the great philosophers throughout history have also been mathematicians. Think about what you\u2019re doing there. When you\u2019re doing math\u2026you have these propositions that you can state\u2026and you can say these things with about as much certainty as you\u2019re ever going to get as a human being that\u2019s making propositions. For example, 1+1=2. You can say, with pretty much complete certainty, that 1+1=2. To doubt the validity of that statement, is to either be mistaken or to not understand the definitions of the things being questioned\u2026to not understand the definition of, for example, the concept of \u201cone\u201d or \u201caddition\u201d or \u201cresolving an equation\u201d.\nNow the thing that\u2019s so interesting about math\u2026the thing that\u2019s typically intriguing to philosophers about math\u2026is that\u2026 here we have this equation\u2026this equation that we can state with absolute certainty\u2026yet when it comes to things that actually exist in the real world\u2026what is the concept of one? I mean what is that\u2026what is the concept of three\u2026where is that? Is that down there in that crack on the driver\u2019s side between the seat and the door where everything else gets lost? Where is this concept of three located?\nNo, the concept of three doesn\u2019t exist physically, we can\u2019t hold onto it or empirically study it\u2026so what happens is\u2026math becomes this very strange realm where we can arrive at certainty about stuff\u2026but it\u2019s all stuff that doesn\u2019t actually exist in the world we navigate our lives through\u2026but\u2026as I\u2019m sure you can imagine\u2026if you\u2019re somebody that\u2019s interested in arriving at certainty about things that DO physically exist\u2026a promising place to start\u2026 might be to try to emulate what people are doing in mathematics\u2026to try to apply that process to things that DO physically exist\u2026and see if we can get the same level of certainty.\nThis has been tried dozens of times all throughout history, but it\u2019s still an intriguing prospect in 1903 when Wittgenstein reads Bertrand Russell\u2019s book on the principles of mathematics. Now the problem with mathematics just by itself\u2026 is that it\u2019s kind of its own institution\u2026it\u2019s not really useful at informing decision making or helping us think correctly or anything like that. However, Wittgenstein thinks that there\u2019s something else\u2026 that we do\u2026 that has to do with human thought\u2026and when you put it side by side next to mathematics\u2026starts to look incredibly similar. The thing he\u2019s talking about\u2026is formal logic.\nThink about it. In the same way we can arrive at certainty about the notion that 1+1=2\u2026we can arrive at certainty about the notion that if all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. If all A\u2019s are B\u2019s\u2026and some B\u2019s are C\u2019s\u2026then Some A\u2019s must be C\u2019s.\nLogic provides us with parameters for our thinking so that we can be sure that we\u2019re thinking clearly\u2026but on the other hand when it comes to math\u2026really, when was the last time\u2026barring you working in some sort of profession that requires advanced math on a daily basis\u2026which I respect tremendously\u2026tremendous amount of respect for those good, good people\u2026you wouldn\u2019t believe how much I respect these people it\u2019s incredible\u2026barring that, when was the last time you ever used anything beyond basic arithmetic in your every day life? When was the last time you triangulated the position of the oatmeal in your pantry?\nPoint is, it may not often be very practically useful to know that the circumfrence of a circle is pi r squared, just like it may not be very useful to know that some b\u2019s are c\u2019s and some A\u2019s must be c\u2019s\u2026and logic and math may resemble eachother in this way, but a key difference between them\u2026is that unlike math, at least logic can be applied directly to our thinking and help us determine if we\u2019re thinking correctly.\nNow what naturally follows from this\u2026when you say something like all men are mortal, socrates is a man, therefore socrates is mortal\u2026the thing that is implied when you say that is that there must be some sort of fundamental logical structure to all thought. Otherwise what are we referening when we use formal logic. And what follows from THAT if you\u2019re wittgenstein\u2026is that if there\u2019s a logical structure to all clear thinking, there must be a logical structure to communicating those thoughts. We have a name for this logical structure of communication\u2026it\u2019s called language.\nThis is the central task of Wittgenstein\u2019s entire body of work\u2026to try to understand how language is even possible between human beings. To understand the function of language, to understand errors that people make in communication that inevitably lead to errors in their thinking. But in order to fully understand these things, you can\u2019t just look at language. Not only do you have to look at the relationship between language and the things it\u2019s describing, but also the relationship between our thoughts and language.\nWittgenstein has two major works that cover this territory\u2026one published after he died called Philosophical Investigations and one published earlier in his life called the Tractatus. Just to give you an idea\u2026despite the fact that his later work tries to refute a lot of the stuff he laid out in the Tractatus\u2026despite the fact the Tractatus is only 75 pages long\u2026if you had a list of the top ten greatest works in history on the philosophy of language, both of these books would be on that list.\nSo in the Tractatus, Wittgenstein lays out what is more commonly known as the picture theory of language. Famous story\u2026apparently he had kind of a Eureka moment when he was reading the paper about a court case where they were going to reinact the scene of the accident using fake people and fake cars to give the jury the clearest picture possible of what happened. It was in that moment that he realized\u2026 that the function of proper, effective language is descriptive. It describes states of affairs occuring in the world.\nSee, practically everybody doesn\u2019t use language in a way that\u2019s as precise as Wittgenstein thinks is necessary in the Tractatus. Most of us just sort of, cavalierly throw around words and never really think about it because it does the job well enough. For example, I could be telling you a story about how I was walking through the park the other day and I saw this naked dude wearing a sanwich board that had \u201ccapture nicki minaj\u201d written across it, and he was screaming about how she is an ancient shapeshifting mythical creature that has lived for thousands of years and terrorized every society that has ever existed and now shes doing it to us. We gotta stop her.\nPicture that scene. Now consider the fact that every person who just pictured that scene pictured a scene that was similar to others in some ways, but very different in others. And the reason there\u2019s so much variance between the pictures that I put in your heads is because I didn\u2019t respect the function of language, which is descriptive. Think of how many details I left out. Was it night time or day time? What was the weather like? How tall was this man? What color was the sandwich board? Are the police officers that are arresting this man state patrol or local precinct?\nI told you a story\u2026 and the arrangement of words I used worked well enough to relay to you a fun, educational anecdote about Nicki Minaj, but imagine somebody much more skilled than I at describing things that was capable of using the exact right words in the exact right configuration that could put the exact picture they have in their head into yours. In this way, language when used properly, PICTURES the world into somebody else\u2019s head.\nWittgenstein thought if you analyze any sentence closely enough, you could eventually break it down into two primary parts\u2026things he called \u201cnames\u201d\u2026which are terms that describe things in the world\u2026things like the sandwich board, the trees and grass in the park, the police officers cat-o-nine-tails whip\u2026whipping him into submission\u2026and the second part is how these names are specifically configured within the sentence. He thought that in same way there is a logical structure to the world and our thinking, whats the relationship to language? There must be some logical way that we can configure these names, some order, that directly mirrors the relationships between what actually happened in reality. Thereby, creating a PICTURE of the scene.\nBut it\u2019s not enough just to know how reality actually is, we want to be able to speak clearly about every possible way that reality can be, right? So what follows from this if you\u2019re Wittgenstein, is that whenever you state a proposition, anything\u2026it falls into one of three classes. If the proposition does picture reality as it truly is, then the proposition is true. If it doesn\u2019t accurately describe reality but describes a state of affairs that is theoretically possible, say that it was a girl wearing a sandwich board\u2026then that statement is false. If the proposition describes something that is impossible or goes beyond the limits of language, the proposition is meaningless.\nNow Wittgenstein writes this 75 page book\u2026and does he kick his feet up on the desk and have a keg party like every other philosopher does\u2026no\u2026he publishes the book\u2026and then proceeds to quit philosophy. He quit because he thought the book solves every philosophical dispute that had ever existed. See people have been wasting their time in his eyes. From the very beggining people are asking questions like what is the meaning of my life? What is a life well lived? What is beauty? They\u2019ve talked about this stuff they\u2019ve argued back and forth and they cant seem to come to a consensus on any of it.\nWell, what if the reason this has always been the case\u2026 is because philosophers are using the wrong tool for the job? Asking things like what is beauty? What is the meaning of my life\u2026these are transcendental questions. You\u2019re trying to use language\u2026this thing designed to describe states of affairs in the world\u2026this thing haphazardly thrown together by people ordering cheeseburgers over the years, you\u2019re trying to use language to contemplate what the meaning of your life is? Remember, language wasn\u2019t created in a lab by a philosopher king who made sure to include all kinds of neat words to be able to describe anything regardless of how transcendent it is\u2026what if language is just incapable of describing these things\u2026what if the reason \u201cwhat is the meaning of my life\u201d is such a perplexing question, is because we\u2019re always trying to find an answer to it while using language? It\u2019s just not the right tool for the job\u2026it\u2019s like trying to hammer in some drywall with a water bottle. It\u2019s just not gonna work.\nIt should be noted Wittgenstein thinks you CAN find an answer to the question, \u201cWhat is the meaning of my life.\u201d it\u2019s just not going to be through language, and you wont ever really be able to describe it through language. If it\u2019s possible to get an answer, it\u2019s something you have to experience. He says in one of his most famous lines:\n\u201cThe truth shows itself. It is not said or even expressed in thought. What can be said can be said clearly. Whereof one cannot speak, one must remain silent.\u201d\nThat\u2019s his famous line\u2026and so many people out there hear it out of context and they think he\u2019s just saying, Well if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about you should probably keep your mouth shut! No, he\u2019s not parroting some warmed over truism there\u2026he\u2019s saying that language is insufficient at describing these transcendental concepts, and that all these questions that philosophers have been agonizing over like what is the meaning of my life\u2026this is just a result of their thinking being tangled up and confused about the limitations of language.\nThe question what is the meaning of my life\u2026is nonsensical to Wittgenstein\u2026it\u2019s comopletely devoid of meaning. To even ask a question like that, to someone that truly understands the limits of language\u2026would just confuse them.\nFor example\u2026when I say 1+1=4\u2026people that understand basic math instantly know that something is wrong there. Like I said before, for me to say something like 1+1=4\u2026 that implies that I am either mistaken or don\u2019t understand the definitions of what I\u2019m talking about.\nTo Wittgenstein, asking a question like what is the meaning of my life is like asking a question like: How much red paint would it take to be funnier than sound waves? It just instantly shows the person\u2019s hand as someone that is confused about the limitations of language. And just how if I asked you that ridiculous question, you wouldn\u2019t respond back with an answer to me\u2026oh it\u2019s gonna take a half gallon of red paint to do that kinda job!\u2026no, you\u2019d be like wait what? what are you talking about right now? Funnier than sound waves? In other words, you\u2019d ask questions and try to clarify and unpack this very tangled, confused view that I have about the limits of language. This is the role of philosophy to Wittgenstein, to undo these misconceptions that people have about the limitations of language and what happens at the end of that process, as the famous line goes\u2026is that you are like a fly being let out of a fly bottle.\nDon\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t know what a fly bottle was either. Apparently it\u2019s a really old way people used to trap flies and then they sit there and watch it in its little prison as entertainment. Watch it do pushups. Sometimes flies group together and form gangs. We\u2019re trapped in a metaphorical fly bottle is what he\u2019s saying, philosophy\u2019s job is to show us the way out. We eventually realize that all these things we used to agonize over like what is the meaning of my life aren\u2019t actually problems that need to be solved at all.\nSo as I said before, Wittgenstein writes the Tractatus\u2026 and then quits philosophy thinking that he had solved every major philosophical problem. Later in life he came to believe that he had drastically oversimplified what language is in the Tractatus\u2026I heard it said beautifully once\u2026in the beginning of Wittgensteins life he was concerned with the relationship between language and reality\u2026and towards the end of his life he was more concerned with the relationship between language and us as human beings.\nProbably one of the biggest changes between Wittgenstein in the Tractatus and Wittgenstein in his book Philosophical Investigations comes down to how he views the definitions of words and where words derive their meaning. What did people used to do when they were trying to get to the bottom of a definition? Well, let\u2019s go back to our old pal Socrates\u2026he would go into the public square asking people to give him a definition of the word beauty or justice\u2026he\u2019d have conversations ad nausium with his fellow philosophers trying desperately to get to a perfect definition that includes any example of beauty you can come up with. If you remember, so often in these dialogues a person will TRY to give an example of a perfect definition, but Socrates is somehow always able to find an example that doesn\u2019t fit the definition, or an example that fits the definition that no one would agree should be part of it.\nWittgenstein would see Socrates spending his entire life looking for these definitions as yet another example of someone wasting their life because they didn\u2019t understand the nature of language. Wittgenstein would say that the meaning of words\u2026it just doesn\u2019t work that way\u2026that if Socrates lived a thousand lifetimes he would always be able to point out these exceptions to these strict definitions that people like to throw out.\nHe uses the example of the word \u201cgame\u201d. What is a game? Can we get a definition? Is it a competition between two or more people? Well solataire\u2019s a game. Is it just a fun activity someone engages in? Well, riding a roller coaster is fun, but we wouldn\u2019t call THAT a game really. What criteria do we use to determine what a game is? Wittgenstein would say that the problem with us looking for this strict definition of the word game, is that we\u2019re looking at definitions in the same way that people have for centuries\u2026we\u2019re trying to find necessary and sufficient conditions that define every example of a game that we can possibly think of.\nBut what if it doesn\u2019t work that way? Wittgenstein would say, stop trying to find a perfect set of necessary and sufficient conditions\u2026you\u2019re never gonna do it\u2026and instead reflect on the strange fact\u2026that everybody knows what a game is. When I said solitaire, somehow everybody knew it was a game. When I said going on a roller coaster, somehow everybody knew that shouldn\u2019t be classified as a game. What does that mean? How is that possible if we don\u2019t have the definition somewhere up in our heads?\nWhat it means to Wittgenstein is that the meaning of a word comes down to how it is being used in a particular linguistic community\u2026and that unearthing the meanings of the words we use is a process of observing the way that people use the word. The meaning of a word isn\u2019t something that can be simplified into necessary and sufficient conditions\u2026language is a complex, vibrant, living organism that\u2019s constantly shifting and changing. And that if literally everyone literally started using the word literally to just mean the same thing that \u201cseriously\u201d means. The meaning of the word literally would change entirely.\nIn this sense\u2026 its impossible\u2026 to ever come up with a dusty tome filled with the end all be all definitions of words\u2026a perfect definition for the word game\u2026for instance. But that what actually happens is we see things like basketball and bowling and call of duty and hopskotch and we hear the people around us use the word \u201cgame\u201d to classify all these different activities\u2026and our brain at some level recognizes similarities between all these games and we can sense it. Wittgenstein calls these \u201cfamily resemblences\u201d between things.\nKind of like how you might look like your mom but not really your dad, or your second cousin might look like your uncle but not your mom, or your grandpa may have the same male pattern baldness that your sister has\u2026there are very distinct differences, but you guys all share the same family, and even if you don\u2019t look like your dad, you look a lot more like him than I do, coming from a different family. Same thing goes with the meaning of words to Wittgenstein. It\u2019s not that theres a single set of necessary and sufficient conditions that describes every game out there\u2026there are just some games that resemble eachother more, like some family members resemble eachother more. Basketball, Football, Baseball\u2026all very similar. Two teams play against eachother and they have a ball. Monopoly is also a game\u2026there\u2019s no ball in it, but it shares certain characteristics with Football right? Like millionaires fighting against eachother.\nWhat Wittgenstein\u2019s trying to do is illustrate how crucial culture and people are in the process of forming or developing a language. He thinks Descartes sitting around wondering if anybody else exists is absolutely preposterous\u2026because to even be able to articulate yourself through language is evidence of a giant gift you\u2019ve inherited from many people before and around you.\nHe has a famous example called the Beetle in the Box Analogy. Do you have any friends or coworkers where you guys have inside jokes and refer to things as a code name? If anybody else heard you talking about it they would be confused, but it has an established meaning between the two of you? This is a perfect example of how meaning is derived from use\u2026and that a language can\u2019t be created in a vaccuum by a single person, because words get their meaning from an understanding between speakers.\nHe goes the other way. He says imagine everybody in the entire world had a box that they carry around. Inside of this box is something everyone refers to as a \u201cbeetle\u201d. Problem is, no matter what\u2026no one can ever look inside of anyone else\u2019s box and see what they\u2019re referencing as a beetle. In that world, there\u2019s no way for you to ever be able to use the word \u201cbeetle\u201d in any sort of meaningful way. You have no idea what they refer to as a beetle, and they have no idea the meaning you attach to the word beetle. So what happens is\u2026the word beetle just becomes kind of meaningless. You need at least one other person who knows what you\u2019re referencing when you say beetle for this language you\u2019ve come up with to get off the ground.\nAnyway, hopefully some thought provoking stuff for you this week. Thank you for your patience regarding the infrequency, and the abrupt ending\u2026 just got done moving. I won\u2019t take up any more of your time. Thank you for listening, I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_72": {"date": "2017-3-14", "text": "Posted on March 14, 2017\nEpisode 98 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #098\u00a0on Arthur Schopenhauer. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo today is the first episode in a series on Arthur Schopenhauer. Notoriously a guy that thinks this world is a pretty miserable place, notoriously a guy that sees our everday lives as similar to being on a sunny plain with a dark cloud over your head that follows you around\u2026you see the sunlight all around you and you try to get to it but you never will\u2026he\u2019s notoriously a guy that sees the pinnacle of human virtue\u2026or a sage in his philosophical system is someone that rejects any sort of worldly, human desire and spends their days living like an ascetic monk\u2026depriving themselves of everything.\nNow I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that the majority of people listening to this, probably don\u2019t view their lives in the same sort of pessimistic way that Schopenhauer does\u2026probably a little confused right now. Why\u2026 would he say that? In this series we\u2019ll ask the hard hitting questions: Is Arthur Schopenhauer just a drama queen\u2026is this the world\u2019s oldest thirteen year old kid that didn\u2019t get an iPad for Christmas? Or is there maybe something\u2026that Schopenhauer presents as a foundation for why all these things aren\u2019t as dramatic as they might initially seem?\nQuick spoiler\u2026uh one of the things that makes Schopenhauer super interesting when it comes to the history of human thought\u2026 is that he\u2019s the first major philosopher to use only the work of western thinkers before him and independently arrive at conclusions\u2026 that start to look eerily similar to the conclusions laid out in the lot of eastern philosophy, Buddhism, Hinduism, and the like.\nSo anyway\u2026probably the best place to start is to talk about the sort of\u2026 metaphysical bedrock that he builds this philosophical system on top of\u2026and the way he CONSTRUCTS this foundation is by building off of the work of someone I\u2019m proud to call a friend\u2026friend of the show, love to have him on again sometime to catch up\u2026I\u2019m of course talking about Mr. Immanuel Kant.\nSo, Kant\u2019s big famous distinction that he made. I get it, we probably talk about it a little too much on this show and you can always go back to the Kant episodes if you want a more comprehensive refresher course\u2026but just in case this is the first time someone\u2019s ever listened to the show\u2026really briefly I want to go over it again.\nLook around you right now. Look at the world around you. What exactly is going on for you to be able to have these images inside of your head, this picture of the world that you have? Well if you\u2019re Kant\u2026what\u2019s happening is your senses are receiving raw information\u2026you\u2019re seeing things, hearing things, smelling things\u2026and you\u2019re filtering this raw information through your brain that organizes and makes sense of it by using various mental faculties. Cause and effect, Space and Time, how things relate to eachother. In other words, your senses and mental faculties come together in a coalition\u2026and combine their forces to be able to create for you the crude map of the world that allows you to navigate it.\nBut is this crude map of the world a total picture of reality? For example, you can have experiences with things\u2026you can be walking through the part and come across a rock\u2026right? You can pick that rock up\u2026you can turn it from side to side, look at it\u2026you can smell it\u2026spread some breadcrumbs on the ground\u2026throw it at a group of pidgeons\u2026save some money. You can do all kinds of different things with a rock, but your human experience of that rock\u2026 is not the totality of what that rock is. For any number of reasons, for example you certainly wouldn\u2019t deny that while you see the rock as a solid, static and unchanging thing\u2026 if we took that rock and looked at it under an electron microscope\u2026 you\u2019d see that it was actually 99.9% empty space and constantly moving. Point is\u2026 there\u2019s a disconnect between this crude map that we draw in our human experience of the world\u2026 and how things actually are in reality. There\u2019s something out there that is feeding our senses that raw information. Raw information that is then filtered through our mental faculties and transmuted into this picture of the world that we have, so what is it?\nKant says that there are two worlds\u2026the world of human experience\u2026thats the world that you see around you that we have access to\u2026and the world of what he called \u201cthings in themselves\u201d or the way that reality is\u2026 independent of human experience.\nNow if you\u2019re Kant\u2026no matter how hard we try\u2026 we will never be able to directly access this world of things in themselves\u2026all we\u2019ll ever be able to do is understand our human experience of that world. Now if you\u2019re Schopenhauer on the other hand\u2026you agree with Kant to a large extent\u2026but Schopenhauer thinks Kant\u2019s making a few braizen assumptions\u2026 that might be preventing us from knowing more about this other world out there.\nFirst of all\u2026Kant\u2026when you say something like, The World of Things in Themselves\u2026isn\u2019t that sort of pidgeon holing it a bit? Isn\u2019t that sort of\u2026 shading the way that we think about this other world out there\u2026isn\u2019t that sort of biasing us towards assuming that whatever it is that does exist out there\u2026 is a collection of things? Seems like a harmless assumption to make\u2026but it\u2019s a good question: Is what lies on the other side of this veil of perception\u2026 a collection of things necessarily? I mean, certainly in our human experience of the world we see things like dogs, trees, people, rocks\u2026and certainly whatever it is on the other side manifests itself in our human experience as a bunch of things\u2026but isn\u2019t that just another way we categorize things in our human experience of the world? Why does that say anything for certain about this other world?\nSchopenhauer would say\u2026think about what you\u2019re implying when you say Things in themselves. You\u2019re sort of assuming\u2026 that plurality is a thing in this other world. You\u2019re assuming that all these things that seem to be seperate in our human experience of the world\u2026rocks, trees, people\u2026are actually seperate in this other world. But can we safely assume that? Couldn\u2019t it easily be that this other world is made up of one singular thing. A singular thing that we humans just mistake as a bunch of seperate things because\u2026 that\u2019s just how our brains can make sense of it?\nSee it\u2019s so tempting to only look at what Kant\u2019s saying through the lens of materialism\u2026to hear this distinction about how limited our human experience is and to be like you know what\u2026he\u2019s right. I admit it. oly oly oxenfree!\u2026I am but a feeble human\u2026my senses and mental faculties are horrible\u2026but you know\u2026maybe this is just a crude map of what actually exists\u2026but lets just be real\u2026when I\u2019m looking at a tree\u2026whatever it is on the other side pretty much looks like a tree. Right\u2026I mean sure maybe if I had some better eyes\u2026 I could see it different?\u2026sure if I had the eyes of a pelican I\u2019d be able to see things a little better congratulations\u2026you know maybe if I had some super human level of mental factulties\u2026if I had the mental factulties of\u2026 Captain Crunch\u2026you know if I was a Captain Crunch looking\u2026pelican seeing kind of guy\u2026maybe id order things a little more clearly\u2026but ultimately\u2026if I somehow had access to this world of things in themselves\u2026trees would still pretty much look like trees\u2026they just wouldnt be the crude outline of it that I have right now\u2026\nBut Schopenhauer would ask\u2026why is that necessarily the case? And doesn\u2019t that just sound like what a human being would tell themselves if they wanted to feel super special? Like if they wanted to tell themselves that these senses and mental faculties\u2026 that really only depict the world in the way that they do because they gave some mutated fish with a gimp leg a reproductive advantage in a completely random set of atmospheric conditions\u2026yeah, these senses must have just a vice grip on the fabric of reality\u2026right?\nStarts to make you wonder about what this world of things in themselves is like. What might it be like? Another question\u2026how strange of a place might this be? Given the fact that we\u2019re really only basing what seems likely aabout it on our human intuitions.\nAgain, Kant thought we\u2019d never be able to directly access this world of things in themselves\u2026we\u2019d only be able to access our human experience of it. And again, Schopenhauer agrees with Kant to a large extent\u2026but he thinks Kant\u2019s overlooking something that is extremely importanthere . See, philosophers since Kant have all tried to figure out stuff about this world of things in themselves by studying things in our human experience\u2026they\u2019d look at things like rocks, and trees and people\u2026you know all these external things that appear to be seperate from eachother in our human experience of then\u2026and a common strategy is they try to somehow subtract\u2026 our human experience from them\u2026goal being to hopefully learn something about the things in themselves. But Schopenhauer thought, instead of looking outside of ourselves to find an answer\u2026why not look inside? Why not turn inward\u2026 and try to understand something that we have a much more intimate understanding of than anything outside of ourselves. Our\u2026selves.\nHe says it here:\n\u201cConsequently, a way from within stands open to us to that real inner nature of things to which we cannot penetrate from without. It is, so to speak, a subterranean passage, a secret alliance, which, as if by treachery, places us all at once in the fortress that cannot be taken by attack from without.\u201d\nSchopenhauer would want you to ask yourself\u2026what are you at your core? Look inward. When you truly\u2026endeavor fearlessly into understanding the nature of your being\u2026what do you come face to face with? What are you? Well you seem to be\u2026 a bag of skin and bones\u2026but it\u2019s a bag of skin and bones that seems to be animated by something, right? Now, he\u2019s not talking about a soul or a spirit or anything here\u2026he\u2019s an atheist\u2026what he\u2019s saying is that from the moment we come out of the womb\u2026 for some reason\u2026there seems to be this force\u2026that\u2019s directing us\u2026a force that 99% of us take for granted because it\u2019s the only life we\u2019ve ever known\u2026but it\u2019s what he calls this sub conscious\u2026restless\u2026striving for things. This restless striving for your next meal\u2026or a new car\u2026or a better job\u2026if you\u2019re a baby it\u2019s for your next bottle\u2026or to roll across the room and stick your maraca toy into a light socket, they seem to like to do that.\nPoint is, why does the default state of human being seem to be animated by a constant restless striving for things? Always wanting\u2026always reaching and trying to get something. You get your new baseball hat\u2026and then what? You\u2019re done? You just spend the rest of your life sitting around staring at it and stroking it\u2026like you\u2019re Golem? No, you find something else to restlessly strive for. We\u2019ll talk a lot more about this dynamic next episode, but the explanation for all of this restless striving if you\u2019re Schopenhauer\u2026is that the world of things in themselves\u2026is not a world of things at all\u2026that what exists on the other side of this veil of perception\u2026 is a single force that he calls the will to life. Sometimes he just calls it Will. Personally I don\u2019t really like calling it that\u2026little bit misleading\u2026reason being\u2026in the philosophy departments of major universities calling it Will in that context just makes it kind of confusing because that\u2019s the great philosopher Jaden Smith\u2019s dad\u2019s name. And everybody gets confused.\nWhat follows from this if you\u2019re Schopenhauer\u2026is that what you are\u2026what you\u2019ve always been\u2026is a manifestation of this force. A thing cast into this realm condemned to restlessly strive. And what follows from THAT if you\u2019re Schopenhauer\u2026 is that it\u2019s not just you\u2026everything in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is also a manifestation of this force. An asteroid has a will to be an asteroid. A raccoon has a will to be a raccoon. Although in our human experience of the world we make sense of things by thinking in terms of things being seperate from eachother, space, time, cause and effect\u2026although we do that\u2026thats only the way we make sense of it from our point of view and that the reality is that everything in the entire universe is actually one\u2026 we\u2019re all one thing\u2026a force\u2026that\u2019s manifesting itself in countless different ways in our human experience.\nNow at first glance you may think: Hooray! We\u2019re all one! I knew it! What an amazing thing to believe! Now we can all start being nice to eachother. Uh, no. Think of the implications\u2026 of the metaphysical picture Schopenhauer just laid out. If everything in the universe is one\u2026and everybody has their own restless striving that they\u2019re working on\u2026I gotta eat eventually, dont I? Slowly the reality sets in that an inexorable part of my existence\u2026 is that I must destroy another thing that is restlessly striving so that I can continue restlessly striving. In other words\u2026I\u2019m a manifestation of this force\u2026this plant is a manifestation of this force\u2026we are one\u2026that means I have to cannabalize myself in order to continue restlessly striving. In fact, that\u2019s not even the word for it\u2026what\u2019s the word for when you eat yourself? Actually if you know the answer to that question\u2026please please\u2026do not send me an email I want to stay as far away from you as I possibly can.\nNow imagine what our lives navigating this universe become if you\u2019re Schopenhauer. We essentially live in a giant realm, directed by this constant desire to restlessly strive for things, living alongside everything else in existence that also is restlessly striving for things. Now imagine there\u2019s no divine providence. It\u2019s easy if you try. In other words imagine there\u2019s nothing governing the universe that cares whether you get hit by a commuter train, or whether your mom gets her medication or whether an asteroid the size of Europe wants to occupy the same place in space Europe wants to occupy. For all intents and purposes\u2026we exist in a massive completely disinterested realm with a varitable infinity of wills that are potentially competing with ours. We\u2019re condemned to a life of nuerotically, restlessly striving for things\u2026forced to self-mutilate just for the luxury of being able to continue restlessly striving for things. To top it off\u2026once you\u2019re aware of the reality of the fact that we\u2019re all one\u2026now you get to look around you and see the massive amount of suffering that\u2019s visited every second of every day and you realize that that\u2019s ultimately YOU suffering.\nSchopenhauer asks\u2026what thing what person would ever choose to live in such a miserable place? Yet we persist because of that force we\u2019re all manifestations of\u2026it\u2019s too strong\u2026most people go their entire lives not even considering it\u2026just restlessly striving until they die one day. He actually thinks it\u2019s being aware of how miserable this universe is that ultimately prompts people to do any kind of philosophy. He seems to think there\u2019s some kind of connection between how miserable you think the world is and your level of intellect.\n\u201cThe lower a man is in an intellectual respect, the less puzzling and mysterious existence is to him. On the contrary, everything, how it is and that it is, seems to him a matter of course.\u201d\nIn other words if you\u2019re Schopenhauer, you spend your entire life wrapping your head around this force that we\u2019re all manifestations of, while some other dude just never even thinks about it\u2026or I guess a better example\u2026if you\u2019re of a high intellect and existence is mysterious and interesting to you you seek out stuff like the philosophize this! podcast with stephen west\u2026while everyone else sits at home slowly dying watching Larry the Cable Guy.\nNow some of you are probably saying aw come on Schopenhauer\u2026it\u2019s.. not\u2026 that.. bad\u2026the world is not some miserable place neccessarily\u2026what about all the good stuff? Maybe you\u2019re miserable\u2026maybe you didn\u2019t design your life in a way where you have amazing people and things surrounding you all the time\u2026but I did\u2026and I can tell you from experience the universe is not a miserable place.\nTo Schopenhauer\u2026we do this don\u2019t we? We plan and design our lives around trying to drown out that constant hum of misery that\u2019s in the back of our minds. We sit around and think about what we thinks gonna make us happy\u2026and we tell ourselves that we ultimately do the things we do because we think it\u2019s going to make us happy. Now what\u2019s a really common prescription that somebody writes very early on in life about what is going to make them happy? What is a common thing that people want at some point in their life that they think is going to fill their life with joy? Well I want to graduate college, I want to get a job, live in the city\u2026I want to meet somebody\u2026fall in love\u2026get married\u2026have kids and live happily ever after.\nNow if you\u2019re somebody listening to this that has this dream of falling in love getting married and having kids\u2026or if you\u2019re somebody that has had this dream at some point in the past\u2026Schopenhauer would probably ask you\u2026why do think you have this dream? Specifically\u2026this one in particular? Why do you think so many other people have this very same dream? Why are you so sure that getting married and having kids is going to bring you happiness? And intuitively as human beings the answer seems pretty straightforward. Companionship, someones always gonna be there for you, you have these rugrats running around with mammilian brains\u2026they can\u2019t even choose to hate me if they wanted to. Sounds like a pretty good deal.\nSchopenhauer would say that that may be the story you tell yourself in your head of why you want love in your life but it\u2019s not why you\u2019re actually doing it. And look love to Schopenhauer is no question one of the greatest things in life\u2026he\u2019s just saying understand\u2026the TRUE reason\u2026you have such a strong desire to fall in love during your lifetime. He\u2019s thinks that love is an elaborate scam. Run from the altars! Call the Attorney General! You\u2019re being CONNED people. You\u2019re not getting married and having kids because you think it\u2019s going to make you happy\u2026no, the will to life\u2026this force we are all enslaved to\u2026 is subconsciously compelling you\u2026 to want kids\u2026 for the sake of the propogation of the species.\nJust think about the decision to have kids. Think about ALL the costs associated with it. The financial cost, diapers are expensive. The emotional cost, cleaning crayon off the wall. The opportunity cost, all the things you could be doing. The cost of sleep deprivation. The cost of fearing for their safety. The cost of getting frustrated with them. Having a kid is an absolutely MASSIVE resposibility to take on, nobody would disagree with that.\nSchopenhauer thinks\u2026 that if you truly considered all the costs associated with having kids before having them\u2026no rational being\u2026 would ever have kids! No person thinking clearly would ever trade 10-15 minutes of feeling good for a lifetime of costs and responsibilities. He says that the will to life REALIZES this\u2026and it needs some powerful feeling that it can evoke in you\u2026 and make you into a completely irrational person for a short period of time so that you will have kids and keep the species going\u2026we call this feeling of irrationality\u2026love. Love feels so good and people want it so badly in their lives\u2026but to Schopenhauer it is the vehicle driving you to commit some crime that you\u2019ll later plead temporary insanity to.\nI mean think of all the irrational things people have done in the name of love. Think of the blinders they put on. Think of the stories they tell themselves the games that they play. They\u2019re sick people. Now some of you may be asking ok Schopenhauer\u2026if Love really is just a force that\u2019s enslaving me with the sole task of propogating the species\u2026why don\u2019t I love everyone? Couldn\u2019t I have kids with basically anyone walking down the street barring them having had some sort of tragic, tragic accident? Well yeah, you could. But the propogation of the species is not just concerned with sheer numbers, there are other criteria involved\u2026and that whether you realize it or not\u2026the reason you fall in love with the people you do\u2026is not because you actually like things about their personality or feel comfortable with them\u2026it\u2019s because you\u2019re subconsciously reading something about them. You\u2019re reading that they have strengths in areas you have weaknesses, and they\u2019re reading that you have strengths where THEY have weaknesses. Aspects of your character and appearance balance out eachother\u2026the end product of this entire exchange being\u2026more balanced and healthy children that are more likely to go on and reproduce.\nSchopenhauer thought that people who are tall tend to end up with people who are short. People who are meek tend to end up with people who are more courageous. Even though to you it feels like you are making a free choice\u2026 and that you just really like this person\u2026what is actually going on is that you are being sub consciously manipulat ed\u2026 by the will to life to be attracted to a person that will create balanced children. Now this really just leaves one question\u2026if you\u2019re someone that\u2019s unfortunate enough to be a person that is a 1 out of 10 on the attractive scale\u2026where are these hoardes of supermodels that are helplessly attracted to me schopenhauer\u2026where are they?! I\u2019m walking proof you\u2019re wrong Schopenhauer\u2026but he does bring up an interesting point.\nMaybe this is the reason so many people have the experience where they meet someone fall in love get married have kids\u2026and then either get divorced or remain emiserated in a relationship for decades staying together for the kids. Why is that such a common thing that people do? Schopenhauer says getting married is like grasping blind into a sack of snakes and hoping to find an eel.\nThis is a passage from his work The World As Will and Representation:\n\u201cA girl who rejects the proposal of a wealthy and not old man, against her parents\u2019 convenience according to her instinctive inclination, sacrifices her individual welfare to that of the species. But on this very account, we cannot withhold a certain approbation; for she has preferred what is more important and has acted in the spirit of nature (more precisely of the species), whereas the parents advised her in the spirit of individual egoism. In consequence of all this, it seems as if, in making a marriage, either the individual or the interest of the species must come off badly. Often this must be the case, for that convenience and passionate love should go hand in hand is the rarest stroke of good fortune.\u201d\nWhat he\u2019s saying is, if you\u2019re with someone\u2026in his view you\u2019re with them because the will to life is subconsciouly coercing you into having balanced children and propogating the species. And that may render you in a state of temporary insanity\u2026but just know that once you have that kid\u2026you aren\u2019t with somebody that is necessarily emotionally compatible to you\u2026once you propogate the species\u2026once that haze of insanity lifts off of you\u2026you very well may find yourself in a relationship with someone that you actually despise. One things for sure to Schopenhauer\u2026MUCH of the time people find themselves fighting a battle to stay together\u2026 and that it is EXTREMELY rare to have happened to fall in love with someone that you\u2019re compatible with\u2026because\u2026the criteria you were using initially had nothing to do with compatibility.\nAnyway, Schopenhauer was a huge fan of love despite not having much of it himself throughout his life. I think the key thing about love he\u2019d want people to realize preferably as early in life as possible\u2026is that we often sit around thinking about how our lives are going to play out\u2026we know that we want to be happy\u2026and we often mistakenly conflate falling in love and being a happy person. We often think that there is some sort of direct connection between the two. Schopenhauer wanted us to realize that the process of falling in love and the process of being a happy person are COMPLETELY seperate from eachother. You can be happy without love and you can love someone without being happy. Understand love for what it truly is\u2026an extreme feeling that is needed to temporarily convince perfectly rational beings to do the most irrational thing they could ever do in their lives. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_73": {"date": "2017-3-29", "text": "Posted on March 29, 2017\nEpisode 99 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #099\u00a0on Arthur Schopenhauer. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo last episode Schopenhauer presented us with a picture\u2026a picture of what he thinks is the metaphysical reality that we all navigate. Turns out it\u2019s a pretty grim picture\u2026scary picture\u2026not exactly the kind of picture you\u2019re gonna be posting up on Instagram. \u2026uh\u2026I mean, you have a bad picture on Instagram it\u2019s easy\u2026you just put 18 filters on it until it looks halfway decent. There\u2019s no filter that fixes this picture\u2026you can have the worlds greatest filter\u2026you can have that one that superimposes bunny ears on everyone\u2026you\u2019re not posting this picture\u2026look, if you post this picture you\u2019re getting three likes\u2026your mom, your dad and some 80 year old dude that liked it by accident. I mean, think of what Schopenhauer is saying!\nAlthough things appear to be separate in our human experience of the world, the reality is we are all manifestations of a single thing, a force, that he calls the will to life. We exist in this realm\u2026 with a subconscious motor constantly driving us forward where\u2026 the only way TO move forward\u2026 is to interfere with or destroy the other manifestations of this force that surround us. As I said last episode: We\u2019re condemned to a life of neurotically, restlessly striving for things\u2026and we\u2019re forced to self-mutilate just for the luxury of being able to continue restlessly striving for things. This is the picture of your life. And Schopenhauer thought\u2026many of us may tell ourselves a story\u2026we may even put our very own Instagram filter, or 10 filters on this life to try to make that picture look better to us\u2026but the reality is, figuratively speaking\u2026you do have dark circles under your eyes, your skin DOES look disgusting in that picture and the whites of your eyes do look like you have jaundice. It\u2019s a bad picture.\nSpeaking from personal experience there\u2026anyway so Schopenhauer paints this picture of our lives\u2026but we haven\u2019t heard much about what he thinks this means in terms of how we should be behaving\u2026and I think a good place to start is to take a look at how most of us typically behave\u2026talk about why Schopenhauer THINKS we behave this way\u2026and then talk about what he thinks is the greatest way to live. So let\u2019s do it!\nSchopenhauer thinks that because we\u2019re all manifestations of this will to life\u2026from the moment we come out of the womb\u2026we\u2019re in this constant state of restlessly striving for things. Now it\u2019s one thing to speak about it with generalities\u2026but in practice\u2026what does this restless striving for things actually look like in our everyday experience of the world? Well the good news is: everybody listening to this can relate\u2026because everybody listening to this is currently restlessly striving for something\u2026and if you\u2019re somebody out there that DOESN\u2019T think you are\u2026you know that guy\u2026look even if you\u2019re some monk listening to this on top of a mountain while you dust off the giant Buddha statue, extend an olive branch\u2026you can at least look around you and relate to the fact that people don\u2019t spend their lives in some perpetual state of contentment. No, human beings live their lives moving from one state of discontent to the next.\nThis is nothing new\u2026we\u2019ve talked about it several times on this show before. Everybody listening to this currently wants something that they don\u2019t have\u2026and MOST people listening to this tell themselves a story, maybe not consciously it\u2019s not like a mantra you\u2019re repeating to yourself everyday\u2026but at some level most of us believe that once we get enough things that we want\u2026 or we achieve some level of status in the world\u2026then I\u2019m gonna be satisfied. Then I\u2019m going to be happy and just live out the rest of my days smiling constantly\u2026you\u2019re gonna have a six-pack on your cheeks because you never stop smiling.\nThere\u2019s almost endless possibilities of how human beings engage in this behavior. Some people do it with material possessions\u2026once I get my dream car\u2026I\u2019m done. I\u2019m just gonna spend the rest of my life driving around in my car waving at people\u2026that will be my legacy\u2026once I complete my extensive collection of Star Wars memorabilia\u2026I\u2019m just gonna sit around\u2026the rest of my life looking at it saying things to myself like well, would you look at that. People do it with jobs, friends, romantic relationships, weight loss goals, Twitter followers\u2026people will do it where they\u2019ll close their eyes\u2026and they\u2019ll imagine the best version of themselves they can imagine\u2026and they\u2019ll say if only I can get rid of these bad habits that I have and replace them with this ideal collection of good habits\u2026then I\u2019m going to be totally satisfied with the person I am. Once I get to that point, I will be so proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished\u2026 I won\u2019t ever feel the need to improve anything ever again.\nBut what actually happens? Again, it\u2019s nothing new, but what actually happens is you get the dream car\u2026yeah\u2026you ride around in it smiling and waving at people for a couple weeks\u2026but then it just becomes\u2026your car at a certain point. Then inevitably\u2026there\u2019s something else that you\u2019re desiring every day. You improve things about yourself as a person\u2026 and yeah you feel proud for a couple weeks\u2026and then inevitably\u2026there\u2019s something else you want to improve about yourself. You could have it all\u2026you could have used your brains, cleverness, pattern recognition, relentless hard work and you could have killed it in the private sector\u2026sitting out on your yacht with a glass of chardonnay just gazing out at the world that you essentially just conquered. But is it enough to essentially conquer the world\u2026no\u2026at that point you have to run for president and ACTUALLY conquer the world. This is what we are as human beings to Schopenhauer\u2026manifestations of this will to life\u2026 that are constantly restlessly striving for things in a perpetual state of discontent.\nSchopenhauer compares it to running through a sunny field\u2026there\u2019s sunlight all around you, but there is a single dark cloud in the sky that is hanging directly over your head. You can see sunlight in every direction\u2026you can see happiness\u2026it seems within reach, but no matter how fast you run this dark cloud is going to follow you around and you\u2019re never actually get to the sunlight. This is what it means to be a human being in our default state to Schopenhauer.\nNow some of you may be asking really Schopenhauer? Nobody ever gets to touch that sunlight? Even for a very brief period of time? I mean maybe you\u2019re right that I just have these goals that I\u2019m restlessly striving for that are never going to bring me long term happiness\u2026but the fact is\u2026when I get my dream car\u2026I really DO feel great for a couple weeks. Aren\u2019t I experiencing happiness for whatever little amount of time I can in that scenario?\nSchopenhauer would say no, you\u2019re not\u2026look, your default state is to suffer and restlessly strive for things. When you get the car\u2026you haven\u2019t ascended to some new plane of existence known as \u201chappiness\u201d\u2026it\u2019s that suffering has been temporarily removed from your life as you normally experience it. That really great way that you feel when you\u2019re in that place\u2026getting your dream car\u2026feeling on cloud 9\u2026Schopenhauer thinks that\u2019s the way you might POTENTIALLY be able to feel like all the time\u2026if the reality of your existence wasn\u2019t that you are a manifestation of this will to life condemned to restlessly strive and suffer. It\u2019s not that happiness has been added\u2026but that suffering has been subtracted.\nNow another thing you might be saying is OK, so I suffer. OK, so I\u2019m condemned to a life of restlessly striving for things\u2026but I\u2019m confused Schopenhauer\u2026why don\u2019t I feel as miserable and you\u2019re making me feel like I should be? What if I LOVE my life. This suffering that you\u2019re talking about\u2026this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m thinking about on a daily basis. Why am I not miserable if I\u2019m truly in this dark, depressing universe that you\u2019re talking about?\nWell imagine a war vet\u2026stepped on a bouncin\u2019 betty in WW2\u2026blew part of his foot off. He gets medically discharged, sent back to the states, gets surgery\u2026doctors do all they can\u2026but there\u2019s limitations, of course. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s permanent nerve damage\u2026and let\u2019s say no matter what they do\u2026for the rest of his life whenever he puts weight on that left foot of his\u2026whenever he takes a step\u2026there\u2019s just going to be a little bit of pain in that foot. Can\u2019t fix it. Well what does the veteran do in that situation?\nDoes he sit around for the rest of his life agonizing about it? Does he hyper focus on the pain every time he takes a step? Does he let this injury make him miserable every day of his life? No, he just accepts the unfortunate condition that he\u2019s in\u2026and tries to sort of just tune out the pain as he\u2019s walking\u2026eventually gets to the point\u2026 that he doesn\u2019t even notice it anymore\u2026it\u2019s just what life is to him. But is that pain not there just because he\u2019s taught himself a neat trick where he doesn\u2019t pay attention to it?\nOf course it\u2019s still there and Schopenhauer thinks we\u2019re not so different from this war vet. Just because this suffering is the only life we\u2019ve ever known and we\u2019ve learned to accept it and not allow it to make us miserable\u2026doesn\u2019t mean that the suffering isn\u2019t there. Most of us are so good at tuning it out that we just accept it as the only way life could ever be. But just imagine if it was possible for you to feel the way you feel when you first get your dream car or accomplish some lofty goal\u2026what if it was possible for you to feel that way a lot more of the time, or all the time. This contrast just goes to show\u2026 how much suffering we all accept as just the only way life can be\u2026it\u2019s just this hum in the background that we\u2019ve learned to deal with like the war vet has learned to deal with the pain in his foot.\nNow the LAST thing I want to do when talking about Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy is to alienate someone out there. There\u2019s a type of person that we haven\u2019t talked about yet, a type of person that\u2019s probably feeling a little left out right now. Thank you Mr. Schopenhauer for taking my question. What about me\u2026what if you\u2019re somebody that doesn\u2019t have any goals or the slightest inclination to strive for anything really\u2026and pretty much just a general feeling overall that you don\u2019t care about anything or anyone o n this God forsaken planet and that all of this is meaningless? What about me?\nSchopenhauer would say, Yep, that\u2019ll happen. That will happen. Especially in these modern times\u2026 when we have this cushy thing we call civilization\u2026 that makes it so that we don\u2019t really have to strive for anything if we don\u2019t want to\u2026didn\u2019t always used to be that way. In hunter gatherer times\u2026if you\u2019re not restlessly striving for something, you\u2019re dead in a week. Nowadays\u2026 it\u2019s an option as a human being to just\u2026not have any goals\u2026or to sit around lost\u2026 wondering what you want in life and never really take action on anything.\nSchopenhauer says what this type of person\u2019s life becomes\u2026 is a life of boredom\u2026or depression\u2026or anxiety. They\u2019re bored because they\u2019re manifestations of this will to life\u2026and they don\u2019t have anything to restlessly strive for\u2026they\u2019re not doing the very thing they were put into this universe to do. They\u2019re depressed, because, again, they don\u2019t have anything to strive for. There\u2019s this sense of purpose that\u2019s missing when you don\u2019t have any goals that you truly care about. They\u2019re anxious\u2026because instead of striving for some goal they want to acheive, they just sit around this engine that\u2019s redlining\u2026subconsciously this will to life is making them feel like this meth addict\u2026ooh I gotta strive today I gotta strive!\u2026and when they don\u2019t have anything to put that energy into they end up turning that energy inward and restlessly striving over all these little things that they have no control over.\nPeople find themselves in this situation for a lot of different reasons, but I guess the point is\u2026after you\u2019ve worked hard and achieved some goals\u2026 and expected happiness to be on the other side of them and you don\u2019t get it\u2026an alluring trap to fall into is to just not do anything\u2026what good is doing all this work anyway? Schopenhauer says the only way out of this trap\u2026 that\u2019s available to the general public\u2026is you have to find some way to go back\u2026you have to find some way to delude yourself into believing that once you accomplish some goal that you have, it\u2019s going to make you happy. Now, the good news is, no matter how extreme of a case you are in this place\u2026there\u2019s hope for you because remember\u2026you are a manifestation of the will to life\u2026you at your core WANT to restlessly strive for things\u2026it\u2019s part of your nature\u2026you just have to be open-minded and actively search for things that you want. You grind long enough, you stay open minded enough and eventually you\u2019re going to find something\u2026you\u2019re gonna come across a picture of a white sandy beach with beautiful people frolicking around and you\u2019re going to say you know what\u2026it has been ages since I\u2019ve had a good frolic. I want to do that. And off you go.\nSo two broad classes of people. You have the people that are going to ceaselessly strive and desire things for the rest of their life and try to tune out the suffering the best they can\u2026and you have people who don\u2019t have meaningful goals that are going to end up bored, anxious, depressed, many turn to drugs to try to soften the sting of that suffering. Schopenhauer thinks 99.9% of people are going to find themselves in these two categories and they\u2019re going to die in these two categories. We\u2019ve talked about his prescription for the people who are bored\u2026 but he also has a tactic for the other group\u2026 if they ever want a temporary respite from the otherwise constant suffering that they\u2019re going to be experiencing on a daily basis. I want to ask a question\u2026and bear with me at first this question may seem kind of tangential, but I think it\u2019s a good way to illustrate his point here.\nWhy is it\u2026 that pretty much unanimously every human being loves a good view? Why do we pay so much more for property that has an amazing view in the back yard? Why do we love going on a hike, coming to the edge of a ravine and looking out at a vast expanse of trees and lakes and snow capped mountains\u2026people call it breathtaking\u2026why? Why does it do that to us?\nNow there\u2019s a lot of different theories about this. Some philosophers say\u2026 that everything we think is beautiful is ultimately derived from some aspect of nature\u2026and that when we find ourselves on the edge of a cliff\u2026from a vantage point that human beings don\u2019t typically get to see nature\u2026we\u2019re hit with this tsunami of beauty and it just becomes kind of an overload to our systems. But there are other theories\u2026heard a theory on a podcast once and thought about it for a long time\u2026the theory was that maybe the reason we all love a really nice view is because\u2026we have these reward systems set up in our brains\u2026maybe over the course of hundreds of thousands of years of our ancestors trying to subsist\u2026we\u2019ve inherited a feel good response when we come to the edge of a ravine and see the fresh water and the trees and life flourishing\u2026that whole scene giving our ancestors the message in theory that they\u2019re going to live another day.\nBut that\u2019s not entirely consistent, right? There\u2019s places like the Red Rock Conservatory in Nevada\u2026undeniably gorgeous views\u2026it\u2019s a barren desert wasteland though\u2026life isn\u2019t flourishing there\u2026if I got lost and went on a 20 minute nature walk out there I\u2019d come back one giant freckle. But it\u2019s still a beautiful view.\nSchopenhauer would say that the reason we all love a good view is not for any of these reasons, we love it but because it allows us\u2026if only for a couple of minutes\u2026to escape\u2026this state of constantly striving and desiring and reaching for things. Think about it, when you\u2019re on the edge of that cliff\u2026 and you\u2019re looking out at this amazing view\u2026what are you thinking about in that moment? Are you thinking about getting that promotion? Are you thinking about the leopard interior that you want in your dream car? No\u2026you are totally consumed by that moment. Totally present. We love a good view because for just a couple minutes\u2026we\u2019re not thinking about anything but the beauty of what is in front of us.\nBut Schopenhauer didn\u2019t think we only have this sort of experience when we\u2019re staring at a beautiful view outdoors\u2026he thought we could have this moment\u2026 with ANYTHING beautiful enough to captivate us like this. Music, have you ever had a song where you\u2019re feeling it so much you\u2019re not thinking of anything but the song and singing into your hairbrush in the mirror? Or how about a great movie that you feel just totally immersed in, you almost forget that you\u2019re in the middle of a movie theater. Even our super modern forms of art\u2026how about a video game that\u2019s so good you can\u2019t put the controller down. It\u2019s in these moments, to Schopenhauer, that great art and even great philosophy can captivate us to the point that we can briefly escape this otherwise constant striving for things that is our default state as a manifestation of the will to life.\nYou know it\u2019s funny\u2026culturally\u2026at least in the United States\u2026working really hard every day striving towards your goals\u2026 that\u2019s one of the most virtuous qualities you can have. Somebody that spends the vast majority of their life\u2026 listening to music and watching movies and playing video games\u2026when that person arrives at the end of their life\u2026 and they\u2019re 80 years old sitting around the poker table at Shady Acres\u2026talking about what they did throughout their life\u2026that\u2019s not a person their peers are going to have a lot of respect for. Here\u2019s Schopenhauer saying maybe there was some wisdom in that kind of a lifestyle that might not be immediately evident.\nAnother interesting thing to think about is\u2026you know in the same way we shouldn\u2019t relegate our teachers to people that work at a university or people that look or talk a certain way\u2026and that if you\u2019re looking for it\u2026theres wisdom in every situation that you\u2019re in\u2026I mean the other day I learned something from Sesame Street\u2026that\u2019s right..the great philosopher Big Bird gave me an insight that really made me feel great about my life\u2026you know in the same way there is wisdom in every situation\u2026there is beauty in every situation, again, if we\u2019re willing to look for it. Now, if by appreciating beauty we can temporarily escape from this default state of restless striving\u2026is it maybe possible\u2026that if someone had an extreme hypervigilance towards the beauty in every moment\u2026in other words\u2026if they actively sought out and appreciated the beauty all around them every second of every day\u2026could they maybe permanently escape this default state that Schopenhauer talks about. Just interesting to think about.\nSo that\u2019s your lot in life, people. Get over it. Sorry it wasn\u2019t the answer you were hoping for\u2026but the reality is 99.9% of us are going to be stuck in this type of existence\u2026 until we die someday.\nBut what is this .1% of people we keep talking about? Who are they? Schopenhauer thinks there is a third type of person out there\u2026an extremely rare type of person\u2026I\u2019m certainly not one of them\u2026it\u2019s a person that is so special that they are capable of living a life that is in keeping with what he sees as the pinnacle of human virtue. A sage in his philosophical system.\nThis sage is somebody that uses their intellect to arrive at several conclusions that naturally follow from each other, if you\u2019re Schopenhauer\u2026conclusions that lead this person to a single lifestyle\u2026 that they share with other sages. To Schopenhauer, the first reality that a sage has to arrive at\u2026 is that everything in the universe is ultimately one. And when you arrive at that conclusion\u2026what happens is you take a look around you\u2026and you see all of these individual aspects of the will to life interfering with and encroaching upon\u2026 OTHER aspects of the will to life. You see a cat eating a mouse\u2026you see a mother and her baby getting hit by a drunk driver\u2026you see an asteroid hitting a planet\u2026you see\u2026 the absolute maelstrom of suffering that is visited every day in this universe\u2026and the sage realizes something\u2026they realize that this suffering\u2026is ultimately them suffering, because we\u2019re all one thing. From this point, the sage searches for what is causing this suffering so that maybe they can do something about it. What is the force responsible for this entire existence and all of the suffering within it? The Will to life.\nFrom there, there\u2019s only one path forward. Much like waging an inner-Jihad against vice or not being the best person you can possibly be\u2026Schopenhauer says that the sage wages an inner war against the will to life\u2026totally rejecting all the things it compels people to do. Never having sex\u2026not eating good food just for the sake of it being good tasting\u2026living in solitude\u2026denying any desires for fame or fortune\u2026the sage in Schopenhauer\u2019s system\u2026 wages a war against the will to life by refusing to participate\u2026 in the game that it put us here to play. The life of this sage, as you can imagine, starts to resemble the life of an ascetic monk. This, is the pinnacle of human virtue to Schopenhauer\u2026now did HE live this way? No, but he did live more this way than most people do\u2026he DID famously live out the rest of his life alone in an apartment with his pet poodle.\nNow regardless of how you feel about never having ice cream again, selling all your stuff and spending the rest of your life sitting in your empty living room resisting this urge to strive for things\u2026Schopenhauer does make some really valuable insights. Yes, he uses some melodramatic language to express himself at times, and yes, if you accept his world picture you may not feel as excited as you are now about getting dressed up in your suit and tie outfit and going and giving a presentation on Monday\u2026but I think Schopenhauer DOES do a really good job of pointing out how easy it is for us\u2026to be like that war veteran that we talked about. To find ourselves born into this existence\u2026 where suffering in an inexorable part of life\u2026 and to just tell ourselves a story\u2026 and try to do our best to forget about how much suffering we\u2019re actually going through. Should we be just accepting it, or should we be doing more to try to eliminate that suffering? Should our ultimate goal in life be to never experience any suffering, ever?\nNow on the other hand, if you\u2019re Nietzsche\u2026who spent much of his work responding to the work of Schopenhauer\u2026Nietzsche agrees that suffering is an inexorable part of life, but he has a different view of it. Like we talked about on the Nietzsche series, the goal shouldn\u2019t be to completely rid yourself of any kind of suffering\u2026you should EMBRACE suffering\u2026if you\u2019re someone that\u2019s been through a lot of bad stuff in your life\u2026feel privileged to be a person fortunate enough to have gone through that immense suffering\u2026because you are now a more powerful person than someone else that just had it easy their whole life\u2026instead of getting rid of suffering recognize it for what it truly is\u2026as his famous line goes, \u201cThat which does not kill me makes me stronger.\u201d\nBut anyway, whether you agree with Schopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic worldview or not, he does a great job I think of getting us to think about our human experience of reality, our place within the universe and I guess I\u2019ll close with my favorite Schopenhauer quote that I think just encapsulates his work\u2026he\u2019s talking here about the biggest assumption, the biggest error that he thinks people make when they\u2019re looking at their existence:\n\u201cThere is only one inborn error, and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy. So long as we persist in this inborn error\u2026the world will seem to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of being happy. That\u2019s why the faces of almost all elderly people are deeply etched with such disappointment.\u201d\nThank you for listening.

I hope you love the show today.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo I want to begin the episode today by telling you all a very famous story from the history of philosophy. It\u2019s an old story, passed down from generation after generation, from one philosopher to another. And here I am today passing it on to you. It\u2019s a story about a day way back in antiquity, in Athens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlato and his fellow philosophers are all sitting around talking about stuff, as they normally would, questioning the definitions of things\u2013popular thing to do if you\u2019re a philosopher back then. I mean, afterall, how can you ever philosophize about something meaningfully if you don\u2019t have a solid grasp on the definition of the thing? Now the topic of this particular day\u2019s discussion was the question, \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to be a human being?\n\nHow can we define that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, they sit around, they talk about it for a while, throw some theories around, and eventually they come to a conclusion that they\u2019re all pretty satisfied with. Sitting there, nodding at each other, \u201cMmm, yes! Yes! Jolly good!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir answer to this question was, \u201cA human being is a bipedal animal that doesn\u2019t have feathers.\u201d After all, an ostrich has feathers; a toucan has feathers. A human being seems to be the bipedal animal that doesn\u2019t have feathers. So they\u2019re all sittin\u2019 around patting each other on the back, loving this definition, soaking in the glory, when all of a sudden Diogenes the cynic bursts in the door with a chicken he\u2019s just plucked and he says \u201cHey everyone, look! I present to you a human being!\u201d Everybody starts screaming.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[laughs] Diogenes, I miss that guy. Remember he\u2019s kind of a character from this whole time, lived in a tub. Alexander the Great famously took a liking to him. Says to him, \u201cYou know what? If I were not Alexander, then I would want to be Diogenes.\u201d Diogenes says back to him, \u201cYa know, if I were not Diogenes, I would also want to be Diogenes!\u201d Anyway this whole story depicts one of the first times philosophers started asking questions in what would eventually become a massive branch of philosophy known as ontology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOntology is the branch of philosophy that would ask the kind of question \u201cWhat does it mean to be a human being?\u201d Not just that though, ontology would ask, What does it mean to be a thing at all? What is existence? What does it mean for something to be? At what point does something exist, versus not exist?\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say one day you want down to the petting zoo, you met a goat there, and you fed it some alfalfa pellets. Now there\u2019s a lot of people out there that would look at that goat, and they would take the existence of that goat to be a self-evident thing: It exists. And, for the sake of the discussion today, let\u2019s just say fine, that goat definitely exists. It is! \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut then ontology steps in. What does it even mean to exist? What do we mean when we say that something exists? What criteria do we use?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis leads to other questions: What is the nature of existence itself? Is existence a property of that goat? This leaves even more questions: What foundation if there een is one makes it possible for that goat to exist in the first place? These are examples of common ontological questions. But even this is far from the end of ontology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike how \u2018bout this: What if you leave the petting zoo, and later on you\u2019re thinking about that goat. Ya know, what if you really like thinking about this goat? What if you fell in love with this goat? And now, gosh darnit, you\u2019re daydreaming about it all the time. No matter what you do you can\u2019t get that goat out of your head. Now, would you say that that thought about that goat exists? When you\u2019re no longer having the thought, does it not exist anymore? \u00a0Are thoughts just patterns of, ya know, fleeting electrochemical activity? Or do thoughts exist as beings in the same way that a goat is a being, or a rock is a being?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI mean, think about it. What really is the difference between that thought and that goat? You may say, \u201cOkay, well, they\u2019re different to me, because I know one\u2019s just a thought and that it\u2019s not real.\u201d Okay, well what if you took PCP, and you hallucinated that you and the goat ran off to Vegas together to get married, and when you\u2019re walking down the aisle with that goat it feels as real to you in that moment as it did back at the petting zoo? Question is: When you eventually stop hallucinating, and you\u2019re hearkening back to your memory of your honeymoon in Guam with your new goat companion, can that whole experience be said to have existed in some capacity?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve all been here before. Not the goat. We\u2019ve all been up in our heads asking these kinds of questions about what constitutes something existing or not. And philosophers all throughout history have been here as well, in this field of ontology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, there\u2019s definitely some of you out there that hear these sorts of questions being asked, and they just don\u2019t really do much for you: \u201cLook, I love learning about the existentialists and their approach to life. I love learning about the Nicomachean ethics, that\u2019s interesting. But ultimately, I like learning about philosophy that\u2019s actually going to enrich things in my life. What possible benefit can I get from waxing poetic about whether this hypothetical goat exists or not? \u00a0Look, personally, it\u2019s this weird thing about me\u2013I like to learn about stuff that\u2019s actually going to be important to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell the guy we\u2019re going to be talking about today thought that these ontological questions are not only important, they are the most important and simultaneously the most neglected questions in the history of philosophy! His name is Martin Heidegger, and for me to explain to you why he thinks these questions are so important, it\u2019s going to take an entire series. But! I promise you, by the end of it, you won\u2019t just have these obscure questions to think about. You\u2019ll have an approach to life that he lays out that some consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to life ever produced.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut, the journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step!\n\nQuestion is, where do you put that foot first?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt makes sense to me to begin where Heidegger began, at the beginning of his career. Because to understand where he\u2019s coming from with all these innovations in the area of ontology, we have to understand the revolutionary method that was invented by his teacher, a guy that couldn\u2019t\u2019ve cared less about ontology. His name was Edmund Husserl, and his revolutionary method that he invented was called phenomenology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHusserl was like a mad scientist. This mad scientist that emerges at the beginning of the twentieth century just wreaking havoc on everything in philosophy. I guess technically that makes him a mad philosopher. But make no mistake! He is to philosophy and traditional philosophers what a mad scientist would be a science and traditional scientists. He\u2019s like a mad scientist because\u2013Yes, he still gets dressed up in the lab coat, he still conducts experiments. But they\u2019re not the same kinds of experiments that a traditional scientist would conduct. He\u2019s conducting these experiments in this bizarre place deep within his own mind; almost like his own personal underground lair. And, I guess most of all, he\u2019s not doing these experiments for the same reasons a normal scientist would be doing them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne of the things I love most about Edmund Husserl\u2013just as a character within philosophy\u2013is the way that he approaches his work. He\u2019s not concerned with things like what is the meaning of my life, or how we should be behaving, or what the best form of government is. No, Husserl is a mathematician turned philosopher. And, while he thinks ultimately his work is gonna go on to give answers to these kinds of questions, he\u2019s personally interested in one thing and one thing alone in his work: Certainty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee, Husserl noticed something. He noticed, all these philosophers throughout history, trying to find a way to get objective truth about things\u2013Yeah, how\u2019s that going for you guys? I haven\u2019t checked-in in a while. How you guys doing over there?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe realized that they all have basically the same strategy for doing this. They all come up with their own unique, creative ways of looking at the world in a slightly different way then the last guy did; the goal being to correct the assumptions of the past and get us a little bit closer to certainty. But maybe their lack of success can be explained by the fact that their strategy for accomplishing this massive task has been wrong from the very beginning. Maybe instead of looking at the world differently, we should be looking differently at the way that we look at the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s where he\u2019s coming from. Remember Kant? Remember Hume? Remember talking about how we get to our human experience of the world? The senses pick up a flurry of seemingly random, raw phenomena that, by themselves would be pretty chaotic, but we filter those phen through various mental faculties, categories of the mind that help us categorize and make sense of them. Things like space, time, cause-and-effect, many others. This is what makes up our subjective human experience.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, one thing\u2019s for sure, if you\u2019re Husserl: If we ever arrived at something method that does give us objective truth about things, it\u2019s ultimately going to have to be filtered through this very narrow, subjective human experience that we have. Husserl\u2019s method of phenomenology, is not about looking at the world differently\u2013it\u2019s not about looking at the world at all, necessarily. It\u2019s about taking an exhaustively close look at the lens that these objects of our experience are always seen through: Human consciousness, or our subjective experience of the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPhenomenology is a method, designed to better understand the underlying structure of human thought; the hoping that we can, one day, not just merely have an understanding of these objects and our thinking that we typically call the world\u2013the strategy of so many philosophers before him\u2013but instead, maybe we can arrive at certainty about these raw phenomena and how they relate to each other by understanding all of the ways that our human experience of the world distorts reality. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n[9:45] In other words, all these philosophers over the years have tried to arrive at objectivity by sitting on the sidelines, approaching it like they\u2019re some objective third party looking at the world. But human experience is not objective. Here\u2019s Husserl saying that you\u2019re never going to be able to arrive at certainty about anything unless you have a much deeper understanding of that subjective lens that you\u2019re looking at everything through.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe big maxim here that I like to underscore, the question central to phenomenology that\u2019s going to help us understand why Heidegger did what he did, is the question: Is it possible that we\u2019re so familiar with this daily process of just perceiving the world that that familiarity is clouding our ability to see the world clearly?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, thinking about that possibility is not really the default state we find ourselves in as human beings. Right? I mean, most of us don\u2019t sit around thinking about the underlying structure of human thought. We just think about stuff. Most of us aren\u2019t searching for the objective truth about things, like a philosopher would. We just sort of have beliefs. If they work, they work. If they don\u2019t, well, what really happens as a consequence of them not working? What, you go into your thinking closet and turn off all the lights. \u201cStupid! Stupid! Stupid!\u201d And then what happens? You emerge from the closet and revise your beliefs into another flawed interpretation of the world and go on about your life until you have to revise them again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis whole idea of just sort of blindly accepting from birth that there\u2019s this other world out there, separate from us; that it\u2019s our job to uncover the truth about that world by reading more books and having more conversations and many other base assumptions that go along with this deeply flawed attitude that we seem to have of taking so many things for granted\u2013this whole approach is what Husserl refers to has the natural attitude. This is where most people spend their entire lives. But, it\u2019s not a death sentence, don\u2019t worry. Husserl thinks it is possible to develop over time a phenomenological attitude of the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe can do this by suspending our belief in the natural attitude. He calls it bracketing. The main point is to recognize the natural attitude for what it truly is. It\u2019s a belief. A set of beliefs. He\u2019s not saying to not believe the natural attitude. He\u2019s just saying, Put it in check for a bit, and recognize that this default state, this natural attitude, might not be the only way of looking at things. And realize the very serious possibility that this might be an area where we\u2019re coming to the table with a lot of assumptions about beforehand. This is where Husserl starts to sound like a mad scientist, right? This is where his hair starts to stick up like he\u2019s Bozo the Clown.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHusserl thinks that when you start to examine the natural attitude closely enough, you start to see a lot of biases and assumptions. Assumptions that stem from the way the human mind categorizes and makes sense of everything. When you find these biases, he\u2019s a fan of noticing them, acknowledging them, and then marking them with a sort of philosophical reflector tape, to help draw attention to them the next time you\u2019re thinking about things. He says you do this for two reasons:\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re much less likely to make the same sort of natural attitude mistake the next time;\nWhen you start to get enough of this philosophical reflector tape cordoning off areas of these raw phenomena into different portions of thought in your mind that we\u2019re trying to look at\u2026 Eventually what happens is the reflector tape starts to show a pattern. It starts to show you the boundary of where the natural attitude ends, and the raw phenomena begin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s inside of these cordoned off areas, Husserl thinks, that we can more closely focus on the stuff that we\u2019re really concerned with: the aspects of our experience that are necessary and unchanging. In other words, the essence of our experiences, devoid of all the value judgements we place on experience after the fact.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, when you\u2019re in this place, deep within your own mind\u2026 When you\u2019re in the lair of the mad scientist\u2026 there many methods Husserl uses to try to arrive at the essence of any given human experience. I can\u2019t really go through all of them here, but I do want to talk about one of them, because I want you to feel this strange world that Husserl\u2019s operating within when he does his philosophy. This bizarre method he\u2019s using to arrive at certainty that would eventually go on to deeply influence Heidegger and the way that he conducts his work. One tactic is called using an eidetic reduction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[15:0] An eidetic reduction is just one type of strategy Husserl would use to try to arrive at what the essence is of any given experience. Now how do we search for the essence of a human experience? Well, we\u2019ve searched for the essences of things on the show before, right? We just did it with objects, not human experiences like Husserl\u2019s doing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the process: Famous example passed down from Descartes is to try to find the essence of a piece of wax. You can imagine in front of you a red, cylindrical piece of wax sitting on a table. Now let\u2019s break it down. What is the essence of a piece of wax? Well, this particular piece of wax has certain properties, right? It\u2019s red. It\u2019s cylindrical in shape. It may be shiny. He could\u2019ve just bought it at the store. Then again, it may not be shiny. It could be one of those Korean War surplus candles your grandma has up in her attic. This wax has a certain way that it smells, it has a certain way that it tastes. But are any of these properties necessary and invariable\u2013two words that are incredibly important in phenomenology\u2013necessary and invariable components of that wax?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, we can take away the redness. Still could be a piece of wax without being red, right? The wax could smell different and it could still be a piece of wax, right? I mean, what if it wasn\u2019t a gift to your grandma from General Douglas MacArthur? Still would be a piece of wax, it just wouldn\u2019t smell like the 1950s. You could apply heat to the wax and it would melt down into a shape that wasn\u2019t a cylinder anymore; it still would be wax. To find the necessary and invariable components of this wax is to find the essence of the wax.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn eidetic reduction is a particular technique where you use something known as imaginary variation, where the act of creatively varying different components of something, say, the wax, in order to get closer to those necessary and invariable components. For example, asking questions like, What if the wax was blue? Still\u2019s a piece of wax. What if the wax smelled like a gingerbread man? Still wax. What if the wax was made of water? Okay there! Stop! Something changed there about the wax. Now it doesn\u2019t appear to be wax. Now can we try to figure out what specifically needs to be replaced for it to be classified as wax again? I.e. The necessary and invariable components.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow imagine conducting this whole process not on the piece of wax, something we\u2019re all very familiar with. Imagine conducting it on an experience that human beings have. And instead of considering things like color and shape and how it smells\u2013things, again, we\u2019re all very familiar with changing\u2013imagine the equivalent are the ways that your brain organizes and makes sense of that experience. You imagine that, and you can get a rough idea of this strange, mind-bending world that people like Husserl and Heidegger used to operate within. (And you can definitely get an idea of why it would take an entire series to fully explain what Husserl thinks he\u2019s doing here.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut all that doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll that doesn\u2019t matter. All you need to know to be able to understand where Heidegger\u2019s coming from are the basics of this newly, introspective way of approaching philosophy and phenomenology. Keyword: Introspective. Again, instead of trying to find a new, creative way of looking at the objects of our experience, like so many philosophers have done in the past, instead, let\u2019s take a deeper look at what that experience is at its most fundamental level.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut along comes Heidegger, student of Edmund Husserl, who begins his career a card-carrying phenomenologist. It\u2019s right here that he sees phenomenology eventually running into a lot of very serious problems.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, what exactly is it that you\u2019re trying to do, phenomenology? You\u2019re trying to get an exhaustive understanding of the structures of human thought? You\u2019re gonna arrive at the structures of human thought? Heidegger thought, isn\u2019t that kind of an extension of a mistake philosophers have been making all throughout history? Like David Hume. When David Hume writes An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, who really is to say that if David Hume lived for another few years, and could publish another book, this one called An Enquiry Concerning Squirrel Understanding, or Raccoon Understanding, who\u2019s to say that it wouldn\u2019t have been the exact same book? In other words, how can we know for sure that the underlying structure of human thought is not the underlying structure of mammalian thought? Or all conscious thought, for that matter? \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it goes the other way too! What are we using to be able to arrive at these conclusions about the architecture of human thought? Oh yeah, our subjective experience of the world. Let\u2019s say we arrived at a conclusion. How can we ever say that we\u2019re positive that this is the way every human being that\u2019s ever gonna live structures their thought? Or even every human being that\u2019s alive today for that matter? I mean, is it that inconceivable to think that maybe something like your level of intellect effects the structure of your thought? Or, even the culture that you were born into, or the values that you possess? Is it crazy to think that those might have a drastic effect?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, if these weren\u2019t problems enough, Heidegger thinks there\u2019s an even bigger mistake Husserl\u2019s making, and that, even though he\u2019s an undeniable brilliant thinker, and recognized a mistake that so many philosophers have made in the past\u2013Even though he recognized the fact that we shouldn\u2019t be caring so much about the objects of the world before we have a true understanding of the lens that we view those objects through\u2013Heidegger thought there was something massive Husserl himself was overlooking. Husserl may have understood what underlies the objects of our experience, but what underlies the ability to be able to study the structures of human thought at all? Existence.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to exist?\n\nWhat does it mean to be a human being?\n\nThese ontological question we were talking about.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeidegger realized the answers to these questions drastically inform these other two areas that philosophers engage in. Like just imagine for a second, if every philosopher we\u2019ve ever talked about on this show wrote their work from the ontological perspective of Plato and his buddies that we talked about at the beginning of the episode. Like, what would Kant\u2019s work look like, if he just blindly asusmed from the beginning that a human being is just a bipedal animal with no feathers? What if there was no Diogenes to embarrass everyone and keep the conversation going with a plucked chicken?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo question about it, things would look very different.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, when Heidegger takes a look at the history of ontology in the western canon of philosophy, of course there\u2019s variation among the philosophers, but he notices something. On one issue in particular, there seems to be this mutual consensus among practically every philosopher that\u2019s ever lived, and man does a consensus like that start to look rather suspicious to Heidegger.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis concept goes way beyond philosophy, by the way. I mean, if you\u2019re somebody that\u2019s interested in making novel social commentary, or even just being the person at the party that has the most interesting take on the world, here\u2019s a tip from your Uncle Steve: You don\u2019t want to focus your time studying the things that everybody\u2019s arguing about. No, don\u2019t do that. You want to focus your time studying the things that everybody pretty much agrees on. Because, it\u2019s in those areas that people\u2019s ideas are the least challenged.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI mean, everybody knows their position on abortion and why they feel that way about it. But it\u2019s when you start to ask questions that people tend to agree on, like, Why do you structure your relationships the way you do? Or, Why does this never-ending task of finding somebody to love you seem to be an imperative in your life? These are the kind of questions that create progress in our understanding of the world. The questions you never think about. Because, what happens is, you and your group of friends all agree on X, Y and Z, so you end up never really examining your beliefs that much about X, Y and Z. I\u2019m talking about the beliefs that we just sort of off-handedly spout off at a party not even really thinking about it, because people around us all just hold their red cups and smile and nod in agreement. Well guess what, folks? Heidegger\u2019s throwing a party. And practically every philosopher that\u2019s ever lived is on the guest list right now, smiling and nodding at each other about a certain ontological bedrock that they\u2019re all built their systems on top of. And Heidegger\u2019s here to stop smiling and nodding.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is it to be a human being?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s always been some variation of generally the same thing: We\u2019re a rational animal, a conscious agent, temporarily and restlessly navigating this realm, this external world that\u2019s existed for billions of years and will continue to exist with or without us. [22:50] \u00a0Now, it just so happens that in this realm, having a more comprehensive understanding of this external world leads to a lot of very real benefits. So, philosophers traditionally, from Descartes to Locke to Kant all the way up to Husserl, they\u2019ve all dedicated a considerable amount of time to trying to understand this external world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut what if this whole idea, this idea that we\u2019re this human being thing, this conscious agent navigating this realm that\u2019s separate from us, this subject-and-object relationship that exists\u2013What if that\u2019s been a giant assumption philosophers have been making from practically the very beginning? What if that\u2019s the case?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeidegger thinks, Yeah, that\u2019s weird, people all seem to be agreeing on that. So he goes back and he looks at all the arguments people give to justify this sort of ontological position. People like Descartes, for example.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDescartes, we all know the story, tries to doubt everything he possibly can about his existence, and he famously arrives at the conclusion that although you can initially doubt pretty much everything about the existence of the external world, one thing is for certain by virtue of the fact that I\u2019m thinking: I am a thinking thing, of some sort. That\u2019s the fundamental thing that you can know about your existence, that he\u2019s going to use as a foundation for his entire philosophical system.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Heidegger says, No, hold on a second, Descartes. You skipped over something massively important there. The first thing you experience about your existence is not that you\u2019re a thinking thing. To even be able to make an abstraction like that about what you are presupposes that something has to come before that. No, the actual first experience that you have when you exist is just, sort of, being there. Like, \u201cHere I am, guys. Existing. Being there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeidegger has a word he uses to describe this state: dasein. Now, the literal German translation of dasein is \u201cbeing there.\u201d Though, it should be said, Heidegger creates a lot of words all throughout his philosophy. And he\u2019s not doing it because he gets some creepy pleasure from people using the words he invented. He\u2019s creating words because he\u2019s literally talking about things that no person has ever talked about before, and he doesn\u2019t want the biases and connotations that come along with conventional words to cloud people\u2019s understanding of the concepts he\u2019s talking about.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat said, even with something as simple as the concept of dasein, so many different interpretations of Heidegger\u2019s work. And I think my job here is not to lay out every possible interpretation of Heidegger in existence, it\u2019s to hopefully pique your interest about his ideas enough that you go on to read more, and have your own interpretation of his work.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyway, this concept: Dasein: being there. Existence. Here\u2019s where he departs from all the other philosophers. See, because Husserl makes a claim that he\u2019s studying the underlying structure of thought we use to experience this world that\u2019s separate from us. But Heidegger thought, What if this whole notion that we\u2019re subjects navigating objects, that we\u2019re conscious agents navigating an external world, what if that\u2019s wrong? Afterall, our experience of the world before we even arrive at an idea\u2013like that we\u2019re a thinking thing navigating something\u2013is just, being there? Dasein? Being, in the world?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell how \u2018bout this idea guys? What if being and the world are a united thing? That being can\u2019t exist without the world, and the world can\u2019t exist without being? In the English translations of Heidegger, being-in-the-world is hyphenated together, because he sees these two concepts as fundamentally inseparable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is an odd thing to consider at first for a lot of people. But, just like in phenomenology, where we become so familiar with perceiving the world every day that it\u2019s inhibiting our ability to see it clearly, is it possible that we\u2019ve become so familiar with being that that familiarity clouds our ability to see it clearly, too?\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee, to even try to begin to describe this concept Heidegger\u2019s talking about while using western languages, that\u2019s an uphill battle in its own right because the way our languages typically structure sentences are in terms of subjects acting upon objects! That\u2019s how deep this goes. In fact, Heidegger, in his later work, actually advocates poetry as the best form of communication. Not these sentences that continually reinforce this distorted, subject-object false dichotomy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese sentences reinforce the idea that being-in-the-world is existing within some spatial dimension that\u2019s separate from us.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeidegger often talks about the overemphasis so many people place on the idea of something spatially being. What if being-in-the-world is not being within a spatial context, what if it\u2019s more like being in love? Being in love is it\u2019s own thing, right? Maybe being and the world are inseparable from each other for them to be what it is.\n\nBeing is something that we\u2019re engaged in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you remove the languages, when you remove the intuition, when you look at being in a phenomenological way, this is what you find: Being is something that we\u2019re engaged in. Being is something that we\u2019re all engaged in: every person, every animal, every tree, every rock. We\u2019re all united under this larger umbrella of being. We\u2019re all on the same team. And Heidegger thinks we should think about it that way. (#TeamBeing, people!) \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, if this is kind of tough to wrap your mind around, don\u2019t worry. More explanation next episode. We\u2019re going to talk a lot more about what it means to be beings engaged in a world as such. But just know this: I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people about Heidegger. Lots of fans of philosophy all the way up to philosophy professors. And a common experience people have when they first hear about this concept of dasein, is they have this sort of strange moment where they think, How in the world did nobody ever think of this before? And what\u2019s even more interesting to think about it is, what if Being and Time\u2013Heidegger\u2019s primary work early in his life, where he lays out these ideas\u2013what if that was the magnum opus of Thales? What if this was the initial ontological starting point that philosophy began on? How different would philospohy look today? How different would the world look today?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow different would the world look today?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s a nice segue, I guess, because if this series is me ultimately trying to convey why Heidegger thinks these ontological questions are so important, that question sort of brings me to the first point Heidegger would make about these kinds of questions. It\u2019s so easy for us as individuals\u2013as individuals that don\u2019t write philosophical treatises, but just people that look to philosophy as a practical guide to life and how to think more clearly\u2013it\u2019s so easy for us to think of these questions\u2013like, What does it mean to be? What does it mean to be a human?\u2013as again sort of these redundant self-indulgent exercises, right?\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike, short of you being a professor that\u2019s going through some sort of Rocky style training to become the most obscure and unrelatable professor on the face of the planet, why would you ask these questions? Why not ask some real questions? Why not ask questions like, How do we get the ice caps to stop melting? Or, How do we fix widespread poverty? Or, How do we get people to stop killing each other? Real questions!\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeidegger would say, those are all really great questions to ask. But, are we sabotaging our ability to ever be able to arrive at an accurate answer to any of them by ignoring questions th"}, "episode_75": {"date": "2017-4-30", "text": "Posted on April 30, 2017\nEpisode 101 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #101\u00a0on Martin Heidegger. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo just like last episode, I want to begin today all the way back in antiquity. Back in the days when it all began\u2026the days when Heidegger thinks so many of these wrong ways of looking at\u2026the world\u2026and our existence and so many other things\u2026this is back when the seeds were planted for all of those ideas that eventually got us so far off track.\nNow let\u2019s assume for a second\u2026 that Heidegger\u2019s right\u2026 and that philosophers have been making massive assumptions from the very beginning that have been clouding our ability to see existence clearly\u2026you know\u2026shame on you Descartes\u2026but should we really be shaming Descartes? Should that be our attitude? Looking back, can we really be so disappointed with these thinkers and the conclusions that they arrived at?\nQuick thought experiment: put yourself in the open-toed sandals of somebody living all the way back in antiquity. What would that be like? What would it feel like to be a human being back then? When you\u2019re in a thinking mood and you go on a walk\u2026 and you look around yourself pondering all things existence. Think of how absolutely chaotic and random the natural world might seem like to you not knowing what we know now. On the other hand, think of how well-ordered and obviously governed\u2026 the natural world might seem like to you. You know it\u2019s so easy to conflate our experience of the world in 2017 with theirs in 400 BC\u2026it\u2019s so easy when you try to imagine yourself as someone living back in antiquity to just assume that what it would be like for me to live in ancient Greece\u2026basically the same as my experience of the world right now\u2026except I\u2019d be an olive farmer\u2026or working at one of them gyro stands.\nBut seriously put yourself in the shoes of Plato and Aristotle for a second\u2026they don\u2019t have encyclopedia Britannica, they don\u2019t have Google when they\u2019re confused about something, they don\u2019t even have Plato and Aristotle. No, what happens is they just find themselves\u2026 immersed in this profoundly mysterious, enormously complex framework of existence\u2026of being. So\u2026what do they do about it?\nWhat are you gonna do if you find yourself in this place\u2026sit around and marvel at it the rest of your life? Well what THEY did\u2026is they created these very human methods of being able to make sense of what we\u2019re all experiencing\u2026.things like philosophy and science\u2026and over the years up until Heidegger\u2026people have all had pretty much the same sort of strategy\u2026and while on one hand\u2026 science is great at making sense of things and helping us feel a little less confused about the universe\u2026but considering that it\u2019s a method created by humans\u2026is it a method of inquiry that\u2019s necessarily\u2026capable of fully understanding this, again, profoundly mysterious, enormously complex thing known as being that we find ourselves in?\nWell if the answer to that question\u2019s even potentially no\u2026doesn\u2019t take away the value of science as the best thing we\u2019ve come up with so far\u2026doesn\u2019t inspire vitriol towards Plato or Aristotle or anyone else throughout history that\u2019s used science and philosophy to try to make sense of things. But I\u2019ll tell you what it does inspire\u2026it inspires a thought in Heidegger\u2019s mind\u2026that in the beginning\u2026in a desperate attempt to try to make sense of all the mystery of being\u2026people just did the best thing they could think of\u2026they created things like philosophy and science and conducted these traditional philosophical and scientific experiments\u2026the goal being to try to understand the world around them in this\u2026 existence thing that they\u2019re a part of. And they measure things and they find out what this thing\u2019s made of and how it relates to that thing over there and they record the shapes of things and the mass and the volume\u2026 and all sorts of other stuff\u2026 and then all of that\u2019s combined into an ever-changing, ever-evolving scientific picture of being.\nBut Heidegger would ask: is there something more to being than just how much something weighs or what velocity it\u2019s traveling..is what were doing truly understanding the totality of being? Or\u2026 is this us conferring some cold, mathematical human method of inquiry in a desperate attempt to try to make sense of the mystery out there not unlike a Plato or an Aristotle? Is science really helping us understand being? Or is it just giving us this temporary set of empirical facts that make us FEEL like we understand being more?\nAgain, love me some science. Nobodies saying we shouldn\u2019t do science, but we have to understand what we\u2019re doing when we conduct science. Science\u2026and philosophy as it\u2019s conventionally been done\u2026 have certainly produced useful results in their own way\u2026but in terms of truly understanding existence or being\u2026all they\u2019ve really done to Heidegger\u2026is produce this set of facts\u2026 you can tell kids in school that give them this false sense that we\u2019ve come so far in our understanding of being\u2026 hey, because look! now we understand how entities relate to each other\u2026in other words Heidegger thinks\u2026science and philosophy\u2026 the longer they\u2019ve gone on\u2026 have progressively alienated us from that original state where we questioned the true extent of the mystery of being\u2026and they\u2019ve replaced that state with a state of\u2026sort of arrogance clinging on to the rudimentary description of being\u2026 that science and traditional philosophy can give us.\nYou know as we talked about last episode\u2026throughout the history of science and philosophy\u2026existence has pretty much always been looked at as this spatial and temporal realm that we all exist in that\u2019s FULL of entities\u2026entities like buffalo and mountains and nebulae\u2026 all spatially and temporally relating to one another\u2026the strategy for understanding existence\u2026was to try to understand everything about\u2026 these entities and how they relate to each other.\nNow traditionally, to be a human being was to be just another one of these entities in this realm spatially and temporally relating to things\u2026and TRADITIONALLY\u2026this assumption\u2026 has raised a lot of questions about this mysterious thing that we often refer to as consciousness\u2026in other words\u2026if what existence is\u2026is just a bunch of spatio-temporal entities relating to each other\u2026where does consciousness fit into that? Is consciousness an entity? Are thoughts entities?\nThese questions\u2026 have been mysteries in science and philosophy from the very beginning\u2026and look, it doesn\u2019t really bother the average person that consciousness doesn\u2019t seem to fit that paradigm\u2026you know it\u2019s easy to tell ourselves\u2026look, scientists are out there\u2026they\u2019re working on it\u2026alright, they\u2019re gonna figure it out eventually\u2026you know, deepak chopra and eckhart tolle are gonna have a baby and it\u2019s gonna solve all the mysteries of the universe\u2026first word\u2019s gonna be quantum. But Heidegger would ask: What if this idea of existence being this realm of entities relating to each other\u2026you know an idea that at one point\u2026 it was just some human being coming up with it desperately trying to make sense of things\u2026what if that\u2019s wrong?\nSee, Heidegger never uses words like consciousness\u2026or subjective experience\u2026because to even use words like consciousness to describe what we have\u2026 is to imply that consciousness\u2026 is it\u2019s own thing separate from the world\u2026no being and the world are a united thing\u2026dasein\u2026and that if we\u2019re going to try to understand the answer to this question: what is being? Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be trying to come up with an objective, mathematical way of looking at the entities of the world coming at it from an outsiders perspective. Maybe we should approach it from a more insider\u2019s perspective\u2026instead of analyzing entities\u2026maybe\u2026as the famous line goes \u201cWe are ourselves the entities to be analyzed.\u201d\nAgain, instead of asking a question as an outsider like philosophers have always done\u2026asking a question like, \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d A more insiders approach\u2026a Phenomenological approach to answering that question would be to ask, \u201cWhat is it like\u2026to be a human being?\u201d In other words, what is it like to be the being for whom being is an issue at all?\nNow this question is much easier asked than answered. We\u2019re all human beings, we all feel like we understand what it\u2019s like to be a human being. But when you ask that question it\u2019s so easy to confuse what it\u2019s like to be a human being with what it\u2019s like to be you. To think it\u2019s asking\u2026you know\u2026what kinds of activities to you like or not like to do\u2026or what do you think right and wrong are?\u2026you know these things that have been culturally conditioned into us since birth that wouldn\u2019t apply to all human beings that have ever lived. Now, make no mistake\u2026understanding that cultural context that you\u2019re born into IS extremely important to Heidegger, we\u2019re going to talk about it next episode\u2026but when you remove the culture\u2026when you remove all the conditioning\u2026what is common about what it\u2019s like to be a human being between someone born today\u2026versus the 1200\u2019s\u2026versus 10000 BC? What is the Dasein that underlies all of the other stuff?\nNow an easy assumption to make is to say, ok well the way I live my life right now isn\u2019t tantamount to what it\u2019s like to be a human being\u2026I\u2019m just one iteration of what it\u2019s like to be a human being\u2026but look I\u2019m still a human being\u2026all I gotta do is look at the person from 10,000 BC\u2026find the similarities between us\u2026 and I will have arrived at what it\u2019s like to be a human being. But Heidegger thought this was a mistaken way of looking at it because it doesn\u2019t account for the possibility of you being robbed of what it means to be a human being.\nHeidegger thought\u2026that there are various aspects of our modern world\u2026 that have rendered us\u2026 kind of sick at the level of being\u2026not well\u2026and I\u2019m not calling out any particular way of looking at the world or lifestyle or set of behaviors\u2026but you can at least look around at people in the modern world\u2026 and you can see that often times the behaviors that people engage in seem to be trying to fill some void that they have\u2026as though they\u2019re not living the sort of life they were intended to live and there\u2019s something missing.\nThey seem sort of spiritually sick. Most of us seem sick to Heidegger\u2026and because I\u2019m doing this episode in 2017 and not in 10,000 BC\u2026before we even BEGIN trying to talk about the nature of Dasein and what it\u2019s truly like to be a human being\u2026I need to explain to you why Heidegger thinks our modern societies have alienated you\u2026 from what it is to be a human being\u2026one of the primary culprits to Heidegger: our immersion into and fixation with Modern Technology.\nFew common ways of looking at modern technology that Heidegger wouldn\u2019t agree with\u2026one\u2019s the sort of techno-Jesus attitude of, well we have all these problems as a species\u2026people are killing each other, widespread poverty, ice caps are melting\u2026but you know what? I have faith\u2026there will be a second coming of Steve Jobs\u2026and given enough time technology and the internet will save everything. Heidegger wouldn\u2019t agree, in fact\u2026 he\u2019d think that in a weird way\u2026technology\u2019s a co-conspirator when it comes to why we have these problems in the first place. Another common way of looking at technology\u2019s that it\u2019s not inherently bad not inherently good\u2026technology\u2019s sort of this\u2026 neutral, disinterested thing that happens and that technology can be used for good or it can be used for evil, our choice..our job\u2019s to try our hardest to make sure it\u2019s used mostly for good. Heidegger wouldn\u2019t agree with that either.\nTo understand why he doesn\u2019t agree with these outlooks on Modern technology\u2026we have to understand a distinction he makes right there\u2026between technology in general\u2026and MODERN technology.\nSo I guess the place to start is just to ask the question: what is technology? Well when we think of it we think of iPhones and rocket ships and nuclear power plants\u2026but it really goes all the way back to the very first crude tools that human beings created\u2026Heidegger says the sort of agreed upon definition about what\u2019s similar between technology like the wheel and technology like the computer\u2026is that all technology\u2026 is a tool that provides a means to complete some task\u2026and means to some end\u2026 usually having to do with human activity. A cup, for example\u2026 is a piece of technology\u2026and you can use it as a means to bring about various sorts of ends, most commonly\u2026 to drink liquid out of it, but you can do other things too\u2026you can stack things on top of it, you can roll it down the driveway, anything you wanna do with that cup.\nIn fact if you\u2019re indoors right now\u2026look around you and just consider for a second\u2026practically everything you see at one point\u2026 was cutting edge technology. Most of us live our lives completely immersed in this soup of technology without even realizing it\u2026we\u2019re absolutely surrounded by things that are means to bring about some end for us. But that said\u2026important thing to realize: just because a chair\u2019s a tool that provides a means to complete some task\u2026 and a computer\u2019s a tool that provides a means to complete some task\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re the same type of thing.\nNo, Heidegger thinks there\u2019s something VERY different\u2026 about these two types of technology\u2026and while he would agree with that definition\u2026 that technology\u2019s a tool that\u2019s a means to carry out some task\u2026 that definition may be correct\u2026but it\u2019s not complete\u2026 it\u2019s not sufficient\u2026and that to understand why Modern technology\u2026 is so different from other technology\u2026 and\u2019s ultimately contributing to a sickness we have at the level of being\u2026we have to look deeper\u2026we have to look at what the ESSENCE of technology is.\nHeidegger says that where ever you have the notion of something being a means to some end\u2026one presupposition there is the notion of causality. In the case of technology: Something causes some technology to come into being\u2026 and that technology\u2019s used as a means to some end.\nNow for Heidegger\u2019s next trick: to try to dismantle YET ANOTHER assumption about the world\u2026 that seems to stem from the time period of Descartes\u2026if you remember it was right around that time that people largely stopped thinking about causality in terms of Aristotle\u2019s four causes\u2026 and started thinking about it only in terms of the efficient cause of things. For example. If there was a cup. Sitting on a table in front of you. And I asked you what is the cause of that cup\u2026the vast, vast majority of us would say\u2026well, it was whoever or whatever made the cup. In other words\u2026 we would point to only one of Aristotle\u2019s four causes\u2026 the efficient cause\u2026 or the thing that brought the cup into being. The other three causes that we\u2019re leaving out would be the material cause, or what the cup\u2019s made of\u2026the formal cause, or the appearance or shape of the cup\u2026and the final cause or the function or purpose the cup was created for\u2026but we don\u2019t really think of these other three causes as\u2026causes\u2026right?\nI mean, first and foremost we have the efficient cause\u2026the dude that whittled this cup out of wood. Then in the middle we have these formal and material causes but these aren\u2019t causes\u2026what the cups made of and what form it takes didn\u2019t CAUSE that cup. And then beyond that we have the even MORE distant FINAL cause\u2026 which really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the physical cup at all\u2026it\u2019s just the reason\u2026 the efficient cause decided one day to cause this cup to come into existence. But Heidegger would say, hold on\u2026think about what we just said there. If it wasn\u2019t for the final cause\u2026the efficient cause would never have had the slightest motivation to bring this thing into being\u2026 in other words\u2026if you weren\u2019t able to drink liquid out of it or stack stuff on top of it or roll it down your driveway\u2026what person\u2026no matter how crazy they are whittling wood in 2017\u2026what person would ever whittle something into the shape of a cup?\nPoint is, in a strange way\u2026in terms of what caused the cup to be\u2026the final cause starts to seem more important than the efficient cause\u2026but\u2026 this isn\u2019t the point Heidegger\u2019s ultimately trying to make\u2026he\u2019s saying that it\u2019s insufficient to only think about that cup in terms of its efficient cause\u2026 and that if you look closely at all four of these causes\u2026not only are all of them necessary but there\u2019s an interconnectedness to them\u2026they\u2019re all \u201cresponsible\u201d for each-other he says and that in a world before cups ever existed, it wasn\u2019t until\u2026 a Dasein conceived of the final cause of a cup\u2026 in correspondence with the formal and material causes\u2026it wasn\u2019t until that coalition of four was born\u2026 that the idea of a cup\u2026 was revealed\u2026 as something that can potentially be.\nThis is an interesting way to think about it. I mean look around you at all the trees, all the metals\u2026all the rocks. Look at this stuff all around you and consider the fact that lying latent within all of these things\u2026lying latent within nature\u2026are seemingly endless potentialities to be revealed. I mean consider the fact that at one point in history in fact the MAJORITY of human history\u2026nobody ever looked at a tree\u2026imagined the final cause of a rolling pin\u2026and then transmuted it into being from the tree. For the vast majority of the time human beings have been looking at trees\u2026the final cause of a wooden rolling pin\u2026wasn\u2019t even on the table\u2026yet at some level\u2026 that rolling pin has always been a possibility\u2026at some level the potentiality for a piece of that tree to become a rolling pin\u2026 has always been there hidden within nature. Also consider the fact\u2026that in the extremely unlikely event we don\u2019t destroy ourselves in the next 300 years\u2026think of how much more we\u2019re going to be able to do with trees that we have no idea about right now\u2026think of all the possibilities that are latent, hidden within these trees all around us.\nNow I chose a tree as an example on purpose\u2026it\u2019s a bit of foreshadowing of what\u2019s to come and let\u2019s be honest\u2026none of you people ever get emotionally attached to rocks\u2026you\u2019re just not as compassionate no matter how delicate of a geode it is\u2026although to Heidegger there is an attachment we should feel with both rocks AND trees all of us united under the common umbrella of being\u2026.but anyway, we\u2019ve arrived at the essence of technology in the sense of the Greek word Techne\u2026the essence of technology is revealing\u2026revealing the things in the world that already do exist and can potentially exist in the future\u2026technology is the art of bringing forth\u2026 the potentiality of the wooden rolling pin latent within the tree\u2026or bringing forth\u2026 the potentiality of the marble statue latent within the giant piece of rock. This is as true of the wheel as it is of the iPhone\u2026but something\u2019s very different about this process of revealing in modern technology.\nHeidegger writes:\n\u201cThe revealing that holds sway in modern technology does not unfold of a bringing forth in the sense of Poiesis.\u201d\nPoiesis is a Greek word derived from the term that means \u201cto make\u201d. And the distinction that he\u2019s marking there is he\u2019s saying that for the majority of human history, the relationship between human beings, technology and nature\u2026 has been almost like an artisan producing something\u2026it\u2019s a craftsmanship. A Dasein will have certain raw materials\u2026they\u2019ll have a certain final cause in mind\u2026and they\u2019ll arrange or dissect these raw materials in order to bring about a chair or a cup or any new piece of technology. There was a special, personal relationship between Dasein and tree where the tree was looked at in a particular way as a being.\nBut in the case of modern technology, we\u2019ve fundamentally shifted the way we look at the natural world\u2026when it comes to modern technology\u2026\nHeidegger says:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging\u2026which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as such.\u201d\nand that Science and technology:\n\u201cSets upon Nature\u2026 Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now set upon to yield oxygen, the earth to yield uranium\u2026 Even the Rhine itself appears to be something at our command \u2026 the revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of setting upon.\u201d\nIn other words\u2026Heidegger\u2019s not against modern technology like he\u2019s your grandpa saying in my day you looked a man in the eye when you face timed him\u2026no he\u2019s saying modern technology has fundamentally shifted the way that we look at and ACT UPON the natural world.\nRemember at the beginning when we talked about science being something that no question makes the world a much more intelligible and understandable place\u2026but the more we measure and weigh things and understand how entities relate to each-other\u2026the more we have this false sense of understanding of what being is and the more progressively alienated we become to the true mystery of being\u2026modern technology to Heidegger.. can be seen as a natural byproduct of that process. We\u2019ve assigned such a cold, detached value to these other beings like rocks and trees and the oceans\u2026that we don\u2019t even look at them as beings anymore\u2026 we look at them as just\u2026objects\u2026that we can study\u2026and manipulate and then exploit for commercial purposes. Technology CHALLENGES nature in a way.\nHe says:\n\u201cThe work of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field.\u201d\nAnd what he\u2019s pointing out is that we used to have a much more respectful, almost symbiotic relationship with the world whereas now we \u201cenframe\u201d the world\u2026that\u2019s the word he uses and it means to look at the natural world only in terms of how much utility it has for human purposes\u2026don\u2019t worry about the soil\u2026question should be how can I process this soil so that it produces the maximum YIELD for me as a human being. The world is valuable only insofar as its valuable to human beings.\nWe turn the natural world\u2026 into what he calls a \u201cstanding reserve\u201d\u2026or a sort of back-stock of inventory just sitting there waiting to be used and consumed by human beings. Now you may be saying, well what\u2019s wrong with that? We\u2019re human beings\u2026fact is.. we have to consume nature to survive\u2026whats the problem with having a little extra lying around? Heidegger would say there\u2019s nothing wrong with it\u2026no question a peasant probably has a little extra firewood than they need\u2026it\u2019s the way we\u2019re LOOKING at the natural world that\u2019s the problem\u2026the peasant looks at that additional firewood and sees it as pieces of a tree that bring warmth into their existence\u2026modern technology looks at that tree\u2026 and goes, okay is there any way we can grind the tree up, cut it with some baking powder and get 612 IKEA coffee tables out of it instead of only 588? It\u2019s seen MERELY as a resource at our disposal. And while I don\u2019t think Heidegger ever explicitly predicts this happening, you can kind of see where this is going. If were willing to look at the natural world as merely a resource at our disposal\u2026aren\u2019t human beings\u2026 a part of the natural world too? Doesn\u2019t this outlook on being get us uncomfortably close to treating human beings as merely an exploited resource? Don\u2019t we see glimmers of this already\u2026 when it comes to how some companies view an employees work and production? Is it that crazy to think it might one day extend onto humans beings as people?\nThis is another example of how the answers to these pointless, completely academic ontological questions about being\u2026have VERY REAL impacts on the way that human beings are treated and engage with the world.\nNow when it comes to science and technology being a 2000 year process of alienation\u2026there are of course philosophers who disagree with this. John Dewey, contemporary of Heidegger\u2019s\u2026little bit older than him\u2026he sees the progression of technology not as a process of alienation, but one of LIBERATION! You know, where was your bleeding heart when we were being controlled by NATURE. Remember my grandma\u2019s feet? Black from frostbite? Yeah, rubbing them together really fast didn\u2019t work. Nature did that. Look\u2026the metaphysical reality of nature\u2026 is that it can be studied, understood and manipulated for strengthening human potential! That should be exciting to you! Look at how much more we can do! Look at the infant mortality rates! Look at my phone! I have instant contact with practically anyone in the world\u2026I can call my grandma\u2026 on thanksgiving\u2026I can have the same disingenuous conversation with her for the four hundredth time\u2026I don\u2019t even gotta get off the couch. That\u2019s incredible\u2026\nHeidegger would agree\u2026all that stuff is pretty incredible\u2026he\u2019d agree that technology has liberated us from the shackles of nature\u2026but at what cost? Yeah, technology\u2019s liberated us from nature\u2026but it\u2019s also liberated us from a piece of what it means to be a human being. Not all liberations deserve a statue in their honor.\nHeidegger thinks that at our core we are ontological beings\u2026we\u2019re the kind of beings that ask questions about what it means to be or why things are the way they are\u2026we\u2019ve all been there before. We\u2019ve all been out on a walk\u2026stopped\u2026looked at a mountain\u2026or a lamppost or something\u2026 and just been smacked in the face by the profound mystery of being. Why things are they way they are\u2026why things exist at all\u2026how we fit into that picture\u2026we\u2019ve all been there.\nSo let\u2019s return to the example at the beginning of the episode: if you lived in antiquity as opposed to 2017\u2026in fact lets go back even more just to further illustrate the point\u2026if you were a human being born in the year 10,000 BC and you find yourself thrown into this\u2026thing that were all thrown into called being. Your experience of being\u2026in a pre-science, pre-philosophy world\u2026would be MASSIVELY different than your experience of being in 2017.\nThink about it\u2026when you\u2019re walking along one day\u2026 and you look out at the horizon\u2026 and suddenly there\u2019s this giant explosion and lava is spewing everywhere or giant columns of ash are shooting into the sky and blotting out the sun\u202610,000 BC\u2026you cant just go to google and type in what in God\u2019s name was that? When you\u2019re sitting around and it\u2019s pouring rain\u2026and all of a sudden this giant bolt of electricity shoots down from the heavens and destroys a tree right in front of you and you can smell the ozone. 10,000 BC\u2026You can\u2019t just go down to the library and ask, what did that tree do wrong to deserve that?\nIn a pre-science, pre-philosophy world\u2026your existence would be a constant face to face encounter with the profound mystery and enormous complexity of being. And faced with that mystery, by default as an ontological being, you would ask these sorts of ontological questions.\nMaybe this is what\u2019s missing, maybe this is part of the reason we seem so sick. We\u2019ve forgotten to be engaged in the world and aware of the profound mystery of being that is all around us, constantly, and we\u2019ve replaced it with 2000 years of philosophical speculation and scientific measurements.\nMaybe the reason we seem so sick is because instead of seeing ourselves as beings in the world\u2026 a world full of other beings that we are fundamentally united with under our common being\u2026 a world with deep mystery that goes far beyond mass and volume and velocity and cogito ergo sum\u2026maybe instead of that world we\u2019ve been born into a world that tells us we\u2019re a consciousness\u2026navigating a seemingly disinterested universe\u2026full of entities\u2026entities that are separate from us\u2026 objectified entities that we study and manipulate for whatever we humans want to do next. If you\u2019re young and you look at a tree and your confused about some element of it don\u2019t worry\u2026don\u2019t sit there in that confusion don\u2019t go too deep down that ontological rabbit hole\u2026here\u2019s how much it weighs, here\u2019s what color the leaves are and hey here\u2019s a family of trees that we\u2019ve decided it\u2019s a part of! Maybe the way we look at being\u2026changes everything.\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_76": {"date": "2017-5-12", "text": "Posted on May 12, 2017\nEpisode 102 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #102\u00a0on Martin Heidegger. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the last couple episodes have been setting the stage for this one. Descartes\u2026whose by no means the only guy responsible for this\u2026but in the sense he\u2019s the Godfather of philosophy proper\u2026in the sense that so many subsequent philosophers commented on his work and responses to his work\u2026you know\u2026in the sense\u2026Heidegger thinks\u2026that he essentially just took a medieval, Dualistic way of looking at being, threw a little pizzazz on it\u2026added some sprinkles and called it Cartesian subjectivity\u2026in that sense Descartes is sort of the poster-boy for this subject/object way of looking at the world and all the assumptions about how to look at things in the world that come along with it.\nHe took things off the rails\u2026Heidegger thinks\u2026and it eventually led to all kinds of different outcomes\u2026from thinking about ourselves as agents fundamentally separate from being\u2026from treating these entities within nature as merely resources at our disposal as human beings\u2026but one of the most important assumptions\u2026an assumption that may not seem very sinister on the surface\u2026is the assumption\u2026 that this realm that we all seemingly navigate\u2026is primarily\u2026just something to be known. The world is something to be known. Our job is to look at the world, examine it, study it\u2026and arrive at knowledge about it. You see this way of thinking all throughout the history of science\u2026you see the history of philosophy filled to the brim\u2026 with these elaborate, analytical systems produced by philosopher after philosopher trying to get at the foundation of what grounds knowledge, what makes knowledge possible, how do we use the faculties of our human minds to get to this knowledge about things in the world.\nAnd the cool thing about Heidegger is that he doesn\u2019t have a problem\u2026with this whole process that people are entranced by that they\u2019d call arriving at knowledge about being\u2026he certainly thinks this is one TYPE of way that you can look at a single PIECE of being\u2026but he returns to the question: is this the totality of what being is? Do these facts answer the question: what is being?\nWell what IS being, Heidegger? Unfortunately we can\u2019t really science this question away quite yet\u2026I mean, you don\u2019t point the hubble telescope towards the andromeda galaxy\u2026 and when you look through it you don\u2019t see some fluffy cloud with a smiley face, Hey Guys, I\u2019m Being! Wanna study? No, so the question becomes\u2026how DO we study being? Well Heidegger thinks because there\u2019s no fluffy smiling cloud, you don\u2019t study Being\u2026you study beings. And again, the best way to do that is not to come at it from an outsiders perspective and ask a question like, \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d The better way is to ask the question from a Phenomenological perspective\u2026a question that\u2019s more like: What is it LIKE to be a human being?\nWell to begin to answer that question, Heidegger would want us to look at what is unique about our situation as human beings. What is it about the being of a Dasein\u2026that distinguishes it from all the other types of beings out there like rocks or trees or anything else.\nThere are two\u2026 primary features of a Dasein that distinguish it from other beings\u2026 and the beautiful thing is that these two things\u2026 do this whether that Dasein\u2019s living in 2017 or 1492 or 10,000 BC\u2026here it is a Dasein\u2026Heidegger says is a being that one\u2026\u201dtakes it\u2019s own being as an issue.\u201d or takes a particular stance on its being. In other words, a Dasein is fundamentally an ontological being\u2026 or the type of being that asks questions about its own existence\u2026 and then all the other questions that sort of blossom out of that pursuit\u2026that\u2019s one\u2026and two\u2026is that to be a Dasein\u2026is to be a being constantly engaged in tasks or activities that we care about. Now we\u2019re going to unpack this further\u2026but let\u2019s just talk for a second about this concept of being constantly engaged\u2026you know\u2026just like Husserl and many others talk about consciousness\u2026and they say that there\u2019s no such thing as some neutral, disinterested consciousness floating around out there\u2026that consciousness is always what they call actional and referential\u2026or that consciousness is always doing something and pointing toward something.\nFor example, throughout the years philosophers have often times looked at consciousness like it\u2019s this empty, container that we sort of fill up with perceptions\u2026you know the theory being that you\u2019re in a room\u2026you engage in the act of analyzing the room around you\u2026your senses pick up information and sort of populate this otherwise empty container of consciouness.\nBut these phenomenologists realize something as they start to take a closer look at consciousness\u2026they realize that consciousness doesn\u2019t seem to be like an empty container that you fill up with perceptions\u2026it seems to be something that you\u2019re engaged in\u2026that when you\u2019re engaged in the act of analyzing the things in the room around you\u2026your consciousness is always actional\u2026doing something\u2026in this case analyzing\u2026and it\u2019s always referential\u2026or pointing towards something\u2026in this case the things in the room.\nWell obviously Heidegger doesn\u2019t believe in this notion of consciousness\u2026but here\u2019s him saying in a similar sort of way\u2026that there\u2019s no such thing as some neutral, disinterested Dasein out there\u2026there\u2019s no human being that\u2019s just completely devoid of intentionality\u2026an empty container\u2026you know backlit at a museum exhibit somewhere for scientists to study what a human being is at its core. No, to be a Dasein is to always be doing something and pointing towards something\u2026more specifically, to be a being that is constantly engaged in tasks or activities that we care about.\nThis relates back to that notion that the world to Human Beings is NOT primarily something to be known. Heidegger uses the example of a hammer. When we look at a hammer\u2026is our initial experience of that hammer to analyze it and break it down into what elements it\u2019s made out of and how much it weighs and what color it is? No as human beings, our base level experience with a hammer is to look at it as\u2026equipment to be able to carry out tasks. It\u2019s not until, as he says, the hammer breaks\u2026that we start thinking about it in terms of being a separate thing that we can arrive at knowledge about\u2026in other words, we weren\u2019t able to engage in the process of knowing things about that hammer\u2026 if we weren\u2019t already, more fundamentally being in what it\u2019s like to be a human being, to be engaged in tasks.\nNow if we accept this premise\u2026if we accept the premise that a Dasein is fundamentally an ontological being that is constantly engaged in tasks that it cares about\u2026then what explains the vast chasm of behavioral differences between someone born in 10,000 BC\u2026you know\u2026literally sharpening their teeth with rocks\u2026and someone born in 2017\u2026sharpening the contrast of their pictures on Facebook?\nWhat explains it? After all, we\u2019re both ontological beings\u2026we\u2019re both beings constantly engaged in the world\u2026.turns out it comes down to the last part\u2026ontological beings constantly engaged in tasks\u2026that we CARE about.\nThe things we care about\u2026and the various things that dictate the things we choose to care about, many of which that are ENTIRELY out of our control\u2026this overall concept of \u201ccare\u201d\u2026becomes a central focus in Heideggers philosophy. And the way he breaks down what a Dasein ultimately chooses to care about is commonly explained in terms of three major factors, the group of which is sometimes called: The Care Structure.\nWhat a Dasein ultimately chooses to care about comes down to three things: its Facticity, its Fallenness and its Existentiality.\nNow understand that when Heidegger uses the word care\u2026he\u2019s not talking about care in the sense that\u2026 you know you care about your new born baby or you care for your Grandma Beatrice when she gets the chicken pox\u2026no, when you love something\u2026you care about it. when you hate something\u2026you care about it. when you\u2019re envious of something you care about it. The scope of what Heidegger means by care is much wider than the way we might conventionally use the word\u2026and as we discuss each of these three major things that structure what it is a Dasein cares about and is ultimately going to be constantly engaged in\u2026try to think about how this applies\u2026to you, try to think about how your individual Facticity, Fallenness and Existentiality SHADE what it is that you care about.\nSo the first one\u2026is a Dasein\u2019s Facticity. Heidegger would say, look\u2026it\u2019s not like before you were born you found yourself on some cosmic game show where you got to pick when and where you were born, who your parents were, how tall you were\u2026no what happened was one day you just found yourself sort of\u2026thrown\u2026into existence. Thrown into a particular historical context, a particular cultural context, a particular socio-economic class, a particular gender\u2026none of these things are things that you explicitly chose\u2026but ALL of these things DRASTICALLY influence the tasks you care about enough to be constantly engaged in.\nThis collection of things about your individual being that you had no control over\u2026you know, the fact that you are born in 1975\u2026the fact that you have a giant nose that scares small children\u2026the fact that your mom and dad secretly hate eachother and that you grew up in a loveless home\u2026whatever it is that you are\u2026these facts and many others like them individual to you\u2026make up the Facticity of your existence, and again this Facticity strongly influences what things you decide to care about.\nFor example, for a Dasein living in 10,000 BC\u2026just based on the facticity of that Dasein\u2019s being\u2026there will never be point where that Dasein cares about going down to the local gym and training vigorously for two years, flying to Nepal, climbing to the top of Mt. Everest and taking pictures of how awesome their life is. Now in the same way\u2026for you\u2026just based on the Facticity of your being\u2026there\u2019s never going to be a point in your life where you feel like going out into the woods, covering yourself in mud with nothing but a spear\u2026trying to take down a predatory buffalo or two\u2026just playing the odds here.\nPoint is: Heidegger would say often times the tasks we decide to be constantly engaged in\u2026have very little to do with us\u2026they\u2019re sort of decided for us by the particular Facticity that we were born into.\nSo the first one\u2019s Facticity\u2026the second one is Fallenness. Fallenness is one of these concepts\u2026where depending on how you\u2019re interpreting Heidegger\u2026it can be perfectly clear what Heidegger means when he\u2019s talking about it\u2026or it can start to take on a bit of a mystical feel where you GENERALLY get the points he\u2019s making about it but it always feels like there\u2019s some other\u2026more spiritual layer to it where you dont ever fully feel like you\u2019re grasping the entirety of what Heidegger\u2019s getting at\u2026least that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been for me\u2026and in the commentary I\u2019ve read I\u2019ve never seen someone articulate it in any sort of clear way\u2026but again this show isn\u2019t the place to lay out every possible interpretation of Heidegger, so I\u2019ll go with the more common\u2026explanation of Fallenness.\nYou know\u2026because a fundamental aspect of Dasein is to be engaged in tasks\u2026we\u2019re always being TOWARDS something\u2026and because there\u2019s no Pow Wow where you, your family and your friends all sit around a fire discussing EXACTLY what tasks you\u2019re going to engage in down to the tiniest minutia\u2026as Daseins, as human beings\u2026we sort of fall, into tasks by default. Where do we get this default set of tasks to be engaged in? From other people around us\u2026who tell us how we should be behaving.\nYou know there\u2019s that quote you see every now and then goes something like: Get a job. Go to work. Get married. Send your kids to school. Follow Fashion. Walk on the Pavement. Save for old age. Obey the law. Now repeat after me: I am free.\nHeidegger thinks there\u2019s so many things about our modern, technology focused, consumer driven societies that make it easy for us to just fall into a set of tasks predetermined by how other people tell us to behave. To become not one\u2019s own self a Dasein\u2026but a \u201ctheyself\u201d Das Man he calls it\u2026He\u2019s critical of this very modern idea of people being looked at\u2026of human beings\u2026being looked at as primarily\u2026just consumers\u2026consumers of nature\u2026he\u2019s critical of this strange virtue of just living your life\u2026consuming more stuff all around us. He writes in one place:\n\u201cThe circularity of consumption for the sake of consumption is the sole\nprocedure which distinctively characterizes the history of a world which has\nbecome an unworld.\u201d\n\nand this whole process of consuming for consumptions sake is sort of being bankrolled by nature, he writes elsewhere:\n\n\u201cNature becomes a gigantic gasoline station, an energy source for modern\ntechnology and industry.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is\u2026given the particular Facticity that we were all born into\u2026it\u2019s really easy to just fall\u2026 into this role\u2026 of being a modern technologically minded consumer\u2026waiting around for the next thing to consume\u2026seeing yourself as separate from the world, separate from nature, this whole way of being by the way\u2026 propogated by what Heidegger sees as the most elaborate and powerful propoganda machine in the history of the world: that magic box sitting in your front room. Or that magic screen in your hand that tells you all the stuff you need to be consuming, all the life choices you need to be making\u2026all the tasks you need to be engaged in\u2026as a Dasein.\n\nHe writes about it almost explicitly as it being a form of slavery, he says:\n\u201cHourly and daily they are chained to radio and television. \u2026 All that with\nwhich modern techniques of communication stimulate, assail, and drive man \u2014\nall that is already much closer to man today than his fields around his\nfarmstead, closer than the sky over the earth, closer than the change from night\nto day, closer than the conventions and customs of his village, than the tradition\nof his native world.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind Heidegger\u2019s not writing an ethical doctrine when he\u2019s talking about this idea of Fallenness. He\u2019s talking about one part\u2026of the nature of what it is to be a Dasein. Fallenness is an important part of being a Dasein, and while we may not like to admit all the ways that we\u2019re behaving simply because other people have told us to\u2026make no mistake, we\u2019re ALL doing it at varying levels. We\u2019ve all, in a sense, fallen into tasks\u2026 as Daseins it\u2019s part of our nature.\n\nSo the first thing that has an effect on the tasks we decide to care about was our Facticity, the second thing was our Fallenness, and the last piece of this\u2026 care structure\u2026 is our Existentiality. Now another way of putting this is to say that the first thing that has an effect is the reality you were thrown into\u2026the second thing is, what other Daseins are already doing around you\u2026and the last thing are the possibilities that you have at your disposal.\n\nThe reality of being a Dasein\u2026is to be a being\u2026that has possibilities. What Heidegger\u2019s saying is, look. You are a Dasein. You are a particular kind of being that has possibilities. You\u2019re not a rock\u2026you\u2019re not a tree. You know, a rock can\u2019t just decide one day it\u2019s gonna pack up it\u2019s suitcases and it wants to live at the Grand Canyon cause it\u2019s like Mecca for Rocks. No, a rock is a particular type of being\u2026and you\u2026as a Dasein are ALSO a particular type of being\u2026a type of being that has, by its very nature, possibilities.\n\nNow when you consider these three parts of the care structure, Facticity, Fallenness and Existentiality\u2026when you arrive at this place of realizing how they drastically effect the way you\u2019re going to be behaving\u2026Heidegger thinks at this point you\u2019re left with a choice.\n\nIt\u2019s a choice of living a certain way on a giant spectrum between what he calls: Authenticity on one end and Inauthenticity on the other. Now the sort of quintessential example of an Inauthentic person is someone who really only embodies the first two parts of the care structure\u2026their Facticity and Fallenness. They\u2019re thrown into existence and fall into the tasks that other people around them tell them to do, never really considering the possibilities at their disposal about other ways to live their life. Now as you can imagine\u2026the antithesis to that\u2026living Authentically\u2026is to radically consider the possibilities you have and live in a way that brings about what he calls \u201cDasein\u2019s own potentiality\u201d. To be deeply engaged in asking these ontological questions about being\u2026to examine and understand your own Facticity including\u2026the cultural and historical context you were born into\u2026to realize the tasks that you\u2019ve FALLEN into simply because somebody else told you to do it. To be truly authentic\u2026is to fully embody the statement\u2026\u201dbeing one\u2019s own\u201d.\n\nNow as you can imagine\u2026this is far from a dichotomy. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re either you know, a mindless drone going on with whatever other people tell you to do\u2026or, Oh! I don\u2019t just go along with what everyone else does\u2026I must be AUTHENTIC! No, we all exist on different points along this spectrum of Authenticity. And even if you\u2019re self aware enough to have corrected some of the things along the way that you realized were just\u2026 the way other people told you to act\u2026what most people do\u2026 is they get to a point in their life where they feel they\u2019re living Authentically enough\u2026and then they just sort of\u2026 stop asking these ontological questions\u2026they stop trying to arrive at a deeper understanding of the culture and time period they were born into\u2026they stop actively examining their behavior trying to identify the things they do just because someone told them to do it\u2026in practice what most of us do\u2026is we arrive at these sort of rest stops on this giant road trip of life\u2026and living out the rest of our lives laregly inauthentically\u2026while telling ourselves stories like, well I\u2019m more authentic than that person over there. And the interesting thing to think about\u2026is that this too\u2026is part of what it is to be a Dasein.\n\nAgain, Heidegger\u2019s not writing an ethical doctrine here\u2026he\u2019s talking about the nature of what it is to be us. He never says that living authentically is BETTER than living inauthentically\u2026though you get the sense when you read it\u2026that to live inauthentically is to essentially leave out the entire.. existentiality part of the care structure\u2026you get the sense that when you\u2019re living at one of these authenticity rest stops along the highway, that you\u2019re missing out on basically a third of what it is to be a Dasein.\n\nBut anyway, to truly be authentic, to truly be one\u2019s own\u2026is a lifestyle. You don\u2019t dabble\u2026in total authenticity. And Heidegger says what happens when you start living this lifestyle of authenticity\u2026certain things start to happen. When you\u2019re considering possibilities and asking these questions\u2026IF you\u2019re a Dasein like we are immersed in this modern culture\u2026you start to notice\u2026 all the symptoms\u2026 of us being these modern Daseins immersed in a world 2000 years sick and alienated from being.\n\nYou start to see scientific inquiry\u2026you know weighing and measuring and examining things as more like, curiosty than it is actually understanding things. Curiosity vs. Understanding. You start to hear the way people talk to each other\u2026Well, I took timmy down to the pool, we got in the water and would you believe it\u2026there was a flip flop floating in the water. I mean, who is this person? Is there a person walking around the world right now with one flip flop on? That reminds me\u2026the other day at the store\u2026I had a coupon and the machine was just not taking this coupon. This is not a long winded joke by the way\u2026this is actually how a lot of people talk to eachother\u2026and Heidegger thinks when you live authentically\u2026you start to see this sort of conversation as more idle chatter than actual speech\u2026 the same way you see science as more curiosity than understanding. Tons of examples of these symptoms of our modern sickness of being\u2026probably the most famous is the distinction he makes between thinking and calculating.\n\nYou know\u2026in this modern world\u2026you may be an app developer. And you may go to work day after day making that app, programming, planning, designing, troubleshooting and you may use your brain all day long and people may deeply admire\u2026how you use your brain all day long\u2026you may do all that\u2026 and think of yourself as a thinker\u2026you may even say that you think for a living\u2026but Heidegger would say in actuality\u2026you\u2019re not really thinking\u2026you\u2019re doing something different, you\u2019re sort of calculating thing. Again, Heidegger thinks\u2026this calculative type of thinking\u2026is a direct result of modern society and how disconnected we are from being\u2026and as harmless as it may seem on the surface, he thinks this type of thinking could lead to a place where:\n\n\u201cthe approaching tide of technological revolution in the atomic age could so\ncaptivate, bewitch, dazzle, and beguile man that calculative thinking may\nsomeday come to be accepted and practiced as the only way of thinking.\u201d\n\nSo when you live this truly authentic lifestyle\u2026and you pull yourself out of this process of sitting at a rest stop being authentic enough just engaging in one task after another\u2026you start to see the modern world for what it actually is\u2026a world that is thousands of years disconnected..almost hopelessly disconnected\u2026 from being. This is why Heidegger uses so many Greek words throughout his philosophy\u2026he\u2019s returning to these ancient languages that were used to describe aspects of being\u2026before we were so disconnected from being.\n\nSo when he looks at the Greek word for technology\u2026Techne\u2026and sees that it means revealing\u2026if I came to your house and you asked me what technology was and I said, mmm technology is revealing\u2026you\u2019d look at me like I was crazy\u2026at the very least like I\u2019m some insecure person that\u2019s trying to sound deep. Heidegger would say, that the reason I sound so crazy is because of how alienated we are from technology as an aspect of being. How convenient, he would say, that when we search for the essence of technology like we did last episode, we realize that technology IS the art of revealing. In other words, by studying these ancient languages Heidegger thinks we can gain an insight into the true essence of various aspects of being.\n\nSo living authentically\u2026let\u2019s go back for a second to the road trip example\u2026some people never even leave the house on this road trip of authenticity\u2026most of us find ourselves at various rest stops along the way satisfied with how authentic we are\u2026and the further you travel down this road\u2026the more work you put into being authentic\u2026makes sense\u2026the fewer and fewer people you\u2019re going to see camped out at these rest stops.\n\nWell I\u2019ve got a bit of a problem Heidegger. Where is all of this going? Because as far as I can tell I\u2019m going to keep putting in the work\u2026I\u2019m going to keep heading further and further down this road of authenticity until eventually one day I find myself at a rest stop\u2026and nobodies around me. In fact, nobodies around me for a hundred miles. In other words, what if I continually work on myself I am engaged in these ontological questions, I\u2019m listening to that voice inside of me that tells me that I can be something better, I\u2019m learning about my Facticity and Fallenness\u2026what if I do all that and then one day I look around me\u2026and I feel alone. I look around me and it feels like nobody in the entire world is like me. I put in the work\u2026and now I just see most people as willfully inauthentic Daseins\u2026passively going along with a culture and a historical context that\u2026now that I understand it REALLY is just arbitrary\u2026engaging in rituals and behaviors that they DON\u201dT really understand and aren\u2019t bothered by that\u2026is this really the life that I want Heidegger? To look around and feel alientated from everyone? Why not just camp at one of these rest stops with people that I like and call it a life?\n\nNow I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of people out there\u2026where maybe you don\u2019t feel completely alone\u2026but you can certainly relate to this sentiment, right? Just being the kind of person that seeks out new information or tries to think as clearly and distinctly as you can\u2026there\u2019s probably already moments that you have where the average person weighs in on their thoughts on a particular matter\u2026and it\u2019s some variation of \u201cit is what it is\u201d or they parroting some talking point they heard on TV\u2026and it\u2019s not crazy to think you might feel a little bit alone. Well imagine this taken to the absolute extreme.\n\nYou know we can look at this same situation in a Nietzschean way\u2026Nietzsche\u2026 huge influence on Heidegger. And if you want the full explanation go back and listen to the episode on Thus Spoke Zarathustra but I feel like most of you will know what I\u2019m talking about when I reference his different stages of development between the Camel the Lion and the Child. We\u2019re all born camels, most people die camels. Beasts of burden told where to go loaded on our backs are all the cultural expectations of how we should be behaving. Then we transform into the Lion\u2026we scream out the great existential NO!\u2026we say NO to these ways of behavior, realize them for what they are, the way everybody else does things, nothing more nothing less. Our goal eventually is to slay the dragon thou shalt, where written on every scale of the dragon is some way that we must be behaving\u2026after slaying that dragon our goal is to transform into the child\u2026or a state of being where we can CREATE our own values CREATE our own meaning\u2026pick and choose which of these cultural norms we want to go along with the point being that now WE chose how to behave, it wasn\u2019t something loaded onto our backs from birth.\n\nAnd while Nietzsche would no doubt have solutions\u2026you can at least imagine going through this entire transformation\u2026 and arriving at the end of it feeling kind of alienated from most people. After all, most people are born and die camels. Once you see them as the passive beasts of burden that they are\u2026mindlessly going along with an arbitrary culture\u2026is it really enough to tell yourself for the rest of your life that I\u2019m just so awesome and so much more transformed that I can\u2019t help but be fulfilled.\n\nWell Heidegger has a solution to this feeling of alienation. Once you arrive at a place of true authenticity, once you ask the ontological questions and understand the Facticity you were born into and the Fallenness all around you\u2026now it\u2019s time to go back. Now it\u2019s time to realize\u2026 that a fundamental aspect of what it is to be a Dasein\u2026 is to be born into a particular Facticity\u2026more specifically a historicity\u2026a historical context, a cultural context\u2026 with rituals and traditions\u2026this is part of what it is to be a Dasein.\n\nOur job at this point\u2026 is to re-immerse ourselves within our particular culture or set of traditions, embracing that Facticity, enhancing the whole process by looking at it through this authentic perspective that we\u2019ve developed. If you live in Ancient Athens that means to embrace the legal system and become and olive farmer\u2026if you live in 1930\u2019s Germany, it\u2019s to become a Nazi. Which is exactly what Heidegger did.\n\nThere\u2019s some people out there that think Heidegger\u2019s Nazi life should\u2019ve been an entire episode in this series\u2026what he did to Husserl\u2026what he did to other public intellectuals\u2026I don\u2019t know to me it\u2019s always seem like a bit of a fallacy\u2026I mean the ideas either have merit or they don\u2019t I don\u2019t really care much about the mouthpiece they come out of. But I understand the other side too\u2026the guy was a Nazi.\n\nBut anyway I want to close out the episode today with one of the most famous ideas from Heidegger\u2019s philosophy. It\u2019s a way of looking at your life that naturally arises out of the process of living authentically\u2026it\u2019s the idea of Being unto Death.\n\nSo a fundamental aspect of being a Dasein, and a crucial aspect of living authentically, is the process of looking into the future and considering different possibilities that you have. Well what\u2019s the ultimate possibility that we all have to eventually deal with? We\u2019re all going to die. You\u2019re going to die, I\u2019m going to die. Really think about it\u2026you..listening to this\u2026you are oing to die. Now why is that so weird when I say that? If I was talking to you about something you wanted to do in five years and I asked you, what if you die before you ever get to do that\u2026I would be the weird one for asking. If I was at a Q&A with a WW2 vet and he\u2019s 117 years old sitting on stage and I get up in front of the room and ask, when do you think you\u2019re gonna die? I would be the weirdo.\n\nBut death\u2026is a certainty. If you\u2019re living authentically, you realize that it\u2019s an inevitability. What if I brought up some other inevitability of being a Dasein\u2026we\u2019re all eventually gonna be hungry. You\u2019re gonna be hungry I\u2019m gonna be hungry. Why is that not weird to consider? Why is one of those weird to talk about\u2026 and the other one sounds like the beginning of an Applebees commercial?\n\nHeidegger thinks\u2026 that most people think about death in this disconnected, sort of abstract way\u2026they say, yeah I\u2019m gonna die one day\u2026can\u2019t live forever. But do they ever stop and really consider the weight of that reality. In a strange way we live our lives as though we\u2019re NOT going to die, but is that for the best? Heidegger thinks many modern cultures do everything they CAN to allow us to never have to think about the fact that we\u2019re going to die someday. You\u2019re not supposed to talk about death\u2026it\u2019s a very personal thing\u2026it\u2019s Taboo. When somebody dies that\u2019s the absolute worst thing that ever could have happened to them. We relegate death to these distant buildings called hospitals and morgues so that nobody ever has to stare the reality of it directly in the face.\n\nNo we just sort of forget about it\u2026go along with our lives\u2026you go to a party and somebody asks you who are you\u2026tell me about yourself! And what do we say? We say things like I\u2019m an IT Consultant\u2026I\u2019m a psychology student\u2026or I\u2019m a wife or a husband\u2026but are these things really who you are or are these just roles that you play within society? So who are you? Oh, well I\u2019m a good singer\u2026I\u2019m quiet\u2026I\u2019m a handsome man\u2026but aren\u2019t those just roles you play within society too\u2026considering the fact that when you say that someone\u2019s handsome or pretty\u2026all youre really doing is comparing them to how handsome or pretty every other member of society has been that you\u2019ve seen so far. So really\u2026who are you? Oh, well I have values\u2026principles. Who I am is somebody that cares about people\u2026I believe in turning the other cheek\u2026yeah but if you took away those values\u2026you\u2019d ostensibly still be someone, right? If you got fired from your IT job if you got expelled from school\u2026if you got divorced from your wife or your husband, you\u2019d still be someone, right? Who are you really\u2026underneath all this other stuff?\n\nWhen you truly face death\u2026most of us only do it when we\u2019re on our deathbeds\u2026it\u2019s only in that moment that you think of your life as a whole. It\u2019s so easy to get lost in the every day of just being engaged in task after task that we care about. To think of death as this distant thing that we\u2019ll start thinking about when we\u2019re 80 years old. But truly facing the reality of death, Heidegger thinks, makes us into true individuals. Because when you\u2019re on your deathbed you\u2019re not thinking to yourself, Here is the demise\u2026of an IT consultant\u2026a man who loves chocolate bars. No in the moment of death, you\u2019re given a new perspective\u2026you have a wholistic view of your life\u2026one that can be subdivided into chapters and themes\u2026in the moment of death you don\u2019t think about yourself in terms of the social roles that you played\u2026you don\u2019t think about some job that you had\u2026for the first time you\u2019re thinking about who YOU are\u2026for the first time you\u2019re living for yourself, not spending so much energy trying to get everyone\u2019s approval about who you are. In 1961 in a lecture, somebody raised their hand and asked Heidegger one thing we can do that would help us on our ongoing quest of living with authenticity\u2026and he said back: spend more time in graveyards.\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_77": {"date": "2017-5-25", "text": "Posted on May 25, 2017\nEpisode 103 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #103\u00a0on Sartre. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t follow the show on Facebook or you don\u2019t follow me on Twitter you may be a little out of the loop in terms of the requests I\u2019ve been receiving and what this show\u2019s gonna focus on for the next several episodes. So I wanna fill you in.\nYou know, at the end of one of the Heidegger episodes I said that the state of the world is always contingent upon the state of human thought that came before it\u2026and what I meant by that was\u2026whether we realize it or not\u2026every single one of us exists\u2026as a single point\u2026on a massive continuum\u2026known as the history of human thought. Whether we realize it or not\u2026so many of the strong convictions that we have\u2026 things that we think are parts of our personality and the personalities of people around us\u2026have been shaped and in many ways determined\u2026 by the history of philosophical insights within this history of human thought.\nYou know everybody has a particular way that they look at the world\u2026a way that they look at economics and government and human psychology and God and relationships\u2026and if you\u2019re an honest person this way of looking at things is always changing it\u2019s always growing\u2026but the fact remains\u2026at any one point in time\u2026 we all have a particular way that we look at the world that we\u2019ve deemed to be a sort of best practices in that moment\u2026and for years of MY life, at least, whenever I thought about this particular way that I looked at the world\u2026I walked around talking about it like I had come up with it. Like it was all me, like as if at some point I locked myself in a closet and just thought about stuff REALLY REALLY hard for twenty years\u2026 and then emerged with MY way of looking at the world.\nBut what I realized is that so much of the way we look at the world is actually this complex\u2026patchwork\u2026of philosophical insights that we\u2019ve gleaned from the books that we\u2019ve read, the teachers that we\u2019ve had, the people that we\u2019ve met, tons of different things, the point is\u2026whether we realize it or not\u2026we were all born into a particular philosophical\u2026Facticity like we talked about last episode\u2026and this Facticity greatly influences the way that we look at the world.\nNow maybe you\u2019ve listened to this show before\u2026maybe you\u2019ve come across some thinker that embodies some aspect of the way that you look at the world, you know a single piece of that complex patchwork of ideas that you have. But just statistically speaking\u2026if you\u2019re a human being alive in the year 2017\u2026a significant portion of the way that you look at the world is going to be based on the main philosophical lines of thinking that occurred throughout the 20th century\u2026and when you understand the origins of these philosophical lines of thinking\u2026you\u2019re given\u2026a pretty substantial gift that is two fold at least that\u2019s how it was for me\nFirst of all I felt humbled\u2026because finally I didn\u2019t have to look at my set of beliefs as this elaborate art project I\u2019ve been working on for twenty years\u2026and if somebody criticizes my beliefs\u2026 they\u2019re essentially criticizing me\u2026and second of all I felt this weird sense of clarity\u2026because when you turn on the TV\u2026and you see the way that people are behaving\u2026and you take a step back in Plato\u2019s cave and you see the shadows on the cave wall for what they are\u2026when you see what\u2019s going on as a sort of a ripple effect of a\u2026 philosophical stone that was thrown into a pond last century\u2026it starts to all be way less confusing.\nThis is the gift that I would like to give to you over the course of this next series of episodes\u2026and when I thought about where to begin\u2026the first thing I realized we\u2019re going to need is a much deeper understanding of Sartre\u2026much deeper than we got on the\u2026you know, the one episode I did on him where I touched briefly on Freedom and Responsibility. Look bottom line is, to fully understand his concept of radical freedom and responsibility, we have to understand his Phenomenology\u2026to understand his phenomenology we have to understand Husserl and to understand Husserl\u2026we have to understand a long standing, quasi-annoying tradition in the history of philosophy, that people were starting to get very skeptical of around the time of Sartre and Husserl.\nThis episode is a story from philosophy that I\u2019d like to tell you. It\u2019s a story to bring context to everything we\u2019ve learned so far\u2026context I could never give when I was just doing an episode on these thinkers in chronological order\u2026but nonetheless it\u2019s context we NEED\u2026to be able to understand the questions that Sartre thought were worth answering during his time.\nThe story begins with Descartes\u2026godfather of modern philosophy\u2026now in many ways, the story of Descartes is as old as philosophy itself\u2026he\u2019s a mathematician turned philosopher\u2026a mathematician fascinated by the level of certainty we can have when we say things like 1+1 = 2, and he wants to try to emulate this process of mathematical certainty and apply it to thinking the goal being: to arrive at certainty about things.\nYou know, in his book Rules For The Direction of the Mind, he talks about taking clear and distinct propositions and linking them together in the same sort of way a mathematician might say something like: ok well 1+1=2. Alright now 2 + 5 = 7. we know that. Ok now 7 x 4 = 28. Alright now lets bracket all these clear and distinct propositions together that have allowed us to progress up until this point\u2026now imagine this same method\u2026 applied to thinking\u2026except instead of chaining numbers, you\u2019re chaining together clear and distinct ideas arriving at a level of certainty comparable to 7 x 4 = 28. That was the goal\u2026at least.\nSee it\u2019s important to understand where Descartes coming from with all this\u2026Descartes takes a look back at the almost 2000 years of philosophy that had been done before he was alive, and he\u2019s embarrassed..quite frankly. Nobody agrees on anything\u2026nobody has any sort of solid foundation for what they\u2019re writing\u2026it\u2019s all just a bunch of smart people spewing out volume after volume of unverifiable speculation about things\u2026is this really what we want philosophy to be?\nDescartes thinks that where these philosophers all wen\u2019t wrong is in their method\u2026and by the way this same exact sentiment applies more generally just to us in our personal lives\u2026but he says that it\u2019s so easy to fall into the trap\u2026where you\u2019re super interested in something\u2026you want to feel like you know about a topic so badly\u2026that you research it and think about it for a while and you talk to people about it\u2026and then this strange, very human, thirst for knowledge\u2026 takes over\u2026you want to feel like you know about it so badly that you end up getting impatient\u2026 and just ASSUMING that you know everything about it when there was really a lot more to consider if you dug deeper. You know to continue the math metaphor\u2026this is like you want to be done with the test so badly.. that you just write a bunch of answers that seem like they\u2019re about right, but you don\u2019t actually go through and show your work of exactly how you got there.\nWell, enough of that. Enough speculation, enough chaos in philosophy, we need CERTAINTY about things. And Descartes thought if we are ever going to arrive at certainty about things\u2026we need to be taking a much more RIGOROUS look at the METHODS that we\u2019re using to arrive at it\u2026he even uses that word, you know he often talks about how philosophy should be looked at as what he calls a rigorous discipline\u2026and what we\u2019ve been doing so far\u2026uh, it\u2019s been FAR from rigorous. So Descartes lays down the guantlet. From this point forward\u2026let\u2019s all just agree on a couple things. Under penalty of being laughed at, cast out of the room and relegated to the childrens table at the next family reunion\u2026a philosopher truly concerned with the quest for certainty shall henceforth never make any claim that is not: 1, so clear that there is nothing obscure about it and 2, so distinct that there is nothing confused about it.\nClear and distinct. As clear and distinct as 1+1=2\u2026you know you can imagine some of these hypothetical chains of ideas linked together by these earlier philosophers\u2026you can imagine propositions within their thinking that look to Descartes like 2+2=5\u2026and then what happens is all the rest of the ideas that are built on top of that proposition\u2026. come crumbling down. This is what has happened all throughout history\u2026this is the world Descartes is living in\u2026and here\u2019s him throwing down the gauntlet\u2026 trying to make sure it never has to happen again.\nWe need to arrive at certainty. But here\u2019s the thing about certainty\u2026it\u2019s no joke. It\u2019s not enough to just say 2+2\u2026is basically 4.01\u2026no, there\u2019s no close enough when it comes to certainty. And if were TRULY going to be rigorous\u2026if we\u2019re going to arrive at a philosophical system based on certainty\u2026we need to build it completely from scratch we can\u2019t assume ANYTHING about it\u2026 just as a given.\nDescartes says we need to doubt everything even things\u2026 that may seem a little bit silly when you\u2019re initially doubting them\u2026things, for example, like whether or not we actually exist. Can\u2019t even take THAT for granted. And lucky for Descartes he gets past that one pretty easily with his famous I think, therefore I am. See if you\u2019re Descartes\u2026 and many philosophers before him for that matter\u2026 the c riteria for knowing something clearly and distinctly\u2026 lies in whether we have direct a awareness of it, rather than some secondary level of awareness of it\u2026 given to us by some other source, For example.\nTo Descartes\u2026when we ask the question whether or not we actually exist\u2026simply based on the observation that we\u2019re thinking about anything at all\u2026to him, at the very least, we must be some sort of thinking thing that exists\u2026in other words\u2026we have this sort of\u2026 direct awareness of our existence present within our minds. But as you can imagine\u2026not everything is this straight forward\u2026even things that may seem\u2026very straightforward.\nBecause on the other hand, to Descartes, take something like the existence of the physical world,\u2026I mean, sure it looks like there\u2019s a physical world out there full of things that we\u2019re interacting with\u2026but can we be certain\u2026 about the things that we\u2019re looking at? After all, we know our minds trick us all the time\u2026right? I mean you get stranded in the desert long enough\u2026dehydrated\u2026it happens\u2026you start hallucenating\u2026you start seeing a McDonalds on the horizon\u2026that McDonalds isn\u2019t actually there\u2026you put a stick in some water, the stick looks bent, but the stick isn\u2019t actually bent.\nThe conclusion here, Descartes says, is that when it comes to the existence of the external world\u2026we\u2019re not directly aware of the things that exist in the world\u2026we\u2019re only directly aware of the way that they appear to us\u2026or the phenomena as they appear to us\u2026important word there\u2026in this story from history\u2026phenomena.\nIn other words if we want to stay in keeping with this rigorous criteria that Descartes laid out trying to get to certainty about things, all we can really give with certainty\u2026 is a description of the phenomena\u2026not the actual external objects of world. Though, Descartes himself never talks about this process of describing phenomena, he just marks the distinction between phenomena and the objects of the world\u2026that\u2019s his contribution\u2026\nNow this idea\u2026that we are something that\u2019s aware of our own existence that can\u2019t be certain about anything else OUTSIDE of our own existence\u2026is a textbook example of way of looking at things that in philosophy is referred to as Solipsism. Now Descartes never would have looked at himself as a champion of Solipsism\u2026he has ways around it\u2026he had an argument where the existence of God was a certainty and that therefore, God would never deceive us by putting all these thoughts in our heads about a world existing if there wasn\u2019t actually one\u2026but, uh\u2026everyone else wasn\u2019t buying that. And I guess the important part is: Descartes got us back on track\u2026he laid down the guantlet of certainty. Finally, for the first time ever, philosophy had been turned into a truly rigorous discipline\u2026and yeah, maybe Descartes didn\u2019t get too far at arriving at these clear and distinct propositions, but at least now, we\u2019re on the right track. Right?\nWell the story of philosophy goes on\u2026time goes on. Thinkers come and go presenting theory after theory\u2026and they certainly make some progress when it comes to these things that we can say with absolute certainty, but the next big breakthrough occurs\u2026 when a guy comes along that we\u2019ve talked about many times on this show before: Mr. Immanuel Kant.\nAgain, for the full explanation go back and listen to the Kant episodes\u2026 but because most of you probably already know what I\u2019m talking about, here\u2019s the lighting round edition just to frame things in this discussion: All of us listening to this look at the world around us and see a world that is solid, static and unchanging\u2026when in reality if we put that table in front of you under an electron microscope you\u2019d see that it was 99.9% empty space and constantly moving. What this tells us\u2026 is that our senses\u2026 weren\u2019t necessarily evolved to be able to understand the fabric of reality itself\u2026but really\u2026 just to be able to create a map of reality that does a good enough job that we can survive and reproduce better than others in a particular set of climate conditions.\nSee, Descartes made a mistake in Kant\u2019s eyes. Descartes made the assumption that the mind didn\u2019t contribute anything to the phenomena it was looking at\u2026he saw us as kind of passive observers just taking it all in. Kant on the other hand says that when you take a closer look at the mind\u2026 how it receives these phenomena, the mind actually contributes\u2026 a LOT to them.\nKant says that for all intents and purposes\u2026there are two distinct worlds that exist. There\u2019s the world of things in themselves\u2026or the world out there\u2026beyond our basic map of reality that we are reading with our senses\u2026and then theres the world of human experience\u2026which is our map of the world\u2026or a world where our senses perceive these things in themselves and create phenomena that we organize through various mental faculties to be able to make sense of them\u2026this whole process producing for us\u2026our human experience of the world. In other words, we are ACTIVE observers organizing and governing the raw phenomena, not just taking them in\u2026and to Kant, we can never know anything about this world of things in themselves\u2026only the world of human experience.\nBut the NEXT chapter in the story\u2026 is that you have post-Kantians coming along saying, ok\u2026well if we can\u2019t ever know anything about this world of things in themselves\u2026how can we know for certain that there\u2019s more than one thing responsible for all these phenomena? How can we know that these things actually cause the phenomena\u2026isn\u2019t causality a category of the mind? Actually\u2026how can we know for certain that this world of things in themselves exists at all?\nAnd the answer is folks, at this point in philosophy: we can\u2019t. This is why Kant is referred to as a Transcendental Idealist\u2026he\u2019s one of the first members in the long standing tradition in philosophy known as Idealism\u2026or the idea that all of reality, or at least as we can possibly know it\u2026 is non-material and a construction of the mind.\n<slow>\nIn other words: We can\u2019t know for certain\u2026we can\u2019t just assume that there are these material objects existing in some hypothetical external world\u2026 that are causing the phenomena we\u2019re experiencing. All that we can be certain about\u2026is going on in our minds.\nAgain, CERTAINTY is what we\u2019re going for\u2026we have to adhere to this rigorous set of criteria descartes laid out.\nNow at this point some of you out there might be thinking\u2026ok\u2026what are we doing here? What EXACTLY are we doing with philosophy? Look, when Descartes questioned whether we really exist or not, it was a fun thought experiment\u2026when Kant did it\u2026I respected the mans tenacity. But at a certain point\u2026what we can\u2019t KNOW whether physical things exist in the world? How ridiculous is that? What, did Kant\u2019s dad never take him aside sit him down and say son\u2026you\u2019re upstairs in your room all day doing your fingerpainting questioning whether the world actually exists\u2026news flash\u2026it does\u2026look see table\u2026its real hey NEWS paper! look it\u2019s the classified section\u2026now you can get a REAL job! oh it\u2019s real\u2026you like THAT don\u2019t you!\nNow of course this isn\u2019t how it went\u2026but it can start to make you think\u2026look I admire the whole quest for certainty thing\u2026I understand what you guys are trying to do and I appreciate it\u2026but at a certain point: I have a life to lead. I have kids to play football with\u2026I have a job to go to. I can\u2019t sit around all day wondering whether a material world actually exists or not\u2026look I\u2019m all for certainty\u2026and I understand you may be right, we may only have our thoughts\u2026the universe itself\u2026may in fact be just one giant thought\u2026but the fact that it\u2019s been this long and you can\u2019t even confirm\u2026. one of the most intuitively obvious things about existence\u2026I\u2019m worried you might be wasting your time and more importantly\u2026I\u2019m worried you might be wasting MY time.\nNow if any of you have ever felt this way over the course of listening to this show: you\u2019re not alone. Because as the story continues\u2026right around the 19th century thinkers started to emerge that were very skeptical of\u2026 not only this longstanding tradition of looking for certainty about things\u2026but more generally\u2026 this long tradition of philosophers assuming that it\u2019s possible to use reason\u2026to just\u2026reason our way to the solutions about every problem we could ever face as a species. Reason to certainty about things, reason to the ideal form of government, reason to a complete scientific world picture.\nThere was a sense at the time that this kind of thinking was\u2026 sort of outdated, kind of nostalgic, old philosophy\u2026for so long we\u2019ve tried to reduce everything into these pre-packaged little rational categories\u2026and we\u2019ve done it so much that these categories have become more important to philosophers than the things that make them up\u2026even human beings for example\u2026I mean, along with this old philosophy went an outdated way of rationally categorizing human beings\u2026this long tradition of seeing people as merely aspects of some larger whole\u2026as merely children of God\u2019s kingdom\u2026or merely members of a state\u2026out went that way of thinking\u2026 and we started to see thinkers emerge like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche\u2026 that looked at what it is to be a human being much more in terms of what it is to be an individual\u2026a relatively modern concept in human history.\nNow of course this wasn\u2019t the only way people were looking at the history of philosophy, but this is the way Sartre was looking at it: there was this feeling\u2026 that maybe this trajectory of philosophy brought about in the 17th century\u2026 had been off the rails for a long time and was utterly devoid of value\u2026there was this feeling that if we ever wanted to make ANY sort of progress in the future we needed to do something radical\u2026something fundamentally different than we have been doing.\nThen along comes a character into history to shake things up\u2026the mad scientist philosopher Husserl\u2026early in his career on the same page as these 19th century thinkers that believe something radical needs to be done\u2026and this is EXACTLY what he\u2019s trying to do with his early work. He\u2019s not SATISFIED with idealism being some sort of final destination\u2026he wants to tweak our methods of looking at these phenomena, study the very structure of consciousness and arrive at a certainty that includes an external, physical world among other things.\nIn other words: this rigorous discipline of philosophy\u2026 just got an extreme makeover. And yeah Husserl would agree\u2026you definitely don\u2019t want to spend every second of your life doubting whether the external world exists or not just because philosophers haven\u2019t arrived at some definitive proof of it. That\u2019d be ridiculous I mean just think if everybody adopted that strategy\u2026nobody in that history of the world would have ever conducted a single scientific experiment\u2026how can you do an experiment on a world that you have no reason to believe actually exists?\nThink about that\u2026just imagine if we never conducted science just because philosophy had never arrived at a method that was going to guarantee we were never mistaken. No, science doesn\u2019t agonize over the idea of never being mistaken like Descartes did\u2026science isn\u2019t in the business of certainty\u2026it\u2019s in the business of coming up a yes largely incomplete, tremendously flawed but PROFOUNDLY USEFUL set of insights that help us understand things a little bit better. Just because it\u2019s not certainty doesn\u2019t make it not useful\u2026and again in a weird way\u2026 if scientists WERE out there looking for complete certainty, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything done.\nHusserl makes a distinction between these two very different ways of orienting yourself to the world\u2026BOTH OF WHICH are useful in his eyes. On one hand we have the Phenomenological attitude sometimes called the philosophical attitude\u2026this is Descartes Gauntlet\u2026this is the rigorous method of looking for certainty that Husserl\u2019s made drastic improvements upon\u2026the, I guess, 100% honest way of looking at things doubting everything including your own existence and then proceeding with caution from there\u2026there\u2019s that and then on the other hand we have what he calls the Natural Attitude\u2026or the sort of default way of orientating yourself to the world\u2026the way of looking at things that all science is conducted through\u2026or as Husserl says the way of looking at things that starts with several big presuppositions but nonetheless allows us to continue on with our daily lives or scientific inquiry without being paralyzed by this quest for certainty.\nThese are two different ways of approaching the world. Scientists don\u2019t doubt the kind of things Husserl doubts when he\u2019s looking for certainty\u2026 they don\u2019t doubt things like whether there\u2019s actually a correspondence between the thoughts they\u2019re having and the object they\u2019re perceiving\u2026they don\u2019t DOUBT things like whether the mind is the kind of thing that\u2019s even capable of arriving at OBJECTIVE FACTS\u2026yet they conduct scientific experiments assuming these things are in their favor\u2026and it makes sense\u2026Husserl would say\u2026 that it\u2019s just simply not useful when you\u2019re doing a scientific experiment to doubt whether the mind is something even capable of arriving at objectivity\u2026if you get too caught up on certainty\u2026it sabotages your very ability to do science. Science is not certainty.\nThis is the point Husserl\u2019s making. The phenomenological attitude and the natural attitude are mutually exclusive. You can\u2019t look at the world in both ways simultaneously. For example, a normal everyday person immersed in the natural attitude\u2026 might go down to the library pick up some Husserl\u2026they might read him\u2026 they might contemplate how they can know anything for certain\u2026maybe they even employ a few of his methods and take a sort of recreational swim in the Phenomenological attitude. But when they\u2019re done reading the book, they leave the library and go on about their day\u2026they\u2019re not still doubting whether the world actually exists or not. On that same note\u2026even the most die hard Phenomenologist\u2026let\u2019s say you work 9-5 as a professional Phenomenologist\u2026the second that bell rings and you take your union standardized break\u2026you\u2019re not sitting around the break room wondering whether the vending machine is just a mental construction or not.\nPracticing Phenomenology is practicing a new way of seeing the world and the things that make seeing the world possible at all\u2026and Husserl would say\u2026yeah it\u2019s possible for someone to get too far down the rabbit hole of the philosophical attitude\u2026sitting around all day yellin\u2019 at people, well YOU don\u2019t even know if any of this stuff exists\u2026so PROVE it! YOU don\u2019t even know if YOU exist! And that certainly would be a waste of time\u2026but be careful cause you can go too far in the other direction too\u2026you can spend your entire life writing off these sort of\u2026 pointless armchair philosopher questions and going on for the rest of your days\u2026never really considering all the presuppositions that come along with the natural attitude.. and honestly believing that what you\u2019re looking at as you walk around every day is OBJECTIVE reality. There are people that talk about what we see as human beings as though it is\u2026objective reality.\nExample everyone will know: there are certain big famous, celebrity proponents of science who are.. by their own admission\u2026proudly willfully ignorant of philosophy who say that philosophy is essentially useless in today\u2019s world..because it\u2019s been replaced by a better, more dynamic system called science\u2026 that does everything philosophy used to do except better.\nThese people are a perfect example\u2026 of what it looks like to go way too far down the rabbit hole of the natural attitude\u2026I mean does Bill Nye realize that if it wasn\u2019t for philosophy he would just be Bill Nye\u2026the guy. I mean seriously. But Bill Nye, NDT, Stephen Hawking, all these people that are proud of the fact they\u2019ve never read philosophy\u2026 and they cavalierly just in normal conversation throw around these terms like Objective Reality and Objective Truth and Facts\u2026one of a few things has to be true about them\u2026either they\u2019ve never considered the limitations of their own senses\u2026the limitations of human knowledge\u2026the assumptions present in the natural attitude\u2026which given how little philosophy they\u2019ve claimed to have read is worrying\u2026or the more charitable reading of this\u2026the reading I force myself to believe as I sit in the corner and neurotically rocking\u2026is that maybe they have considered all these boundaries between themselves and objectivity\u2026but they use words like Objective Truth because they see themselves engaged in a war against religion and they feel like they have to be a direct substitute to it.\nIn other words\u2026maybe it\u2019s all a strategy\u2026maybe they\u2019re not so lost in the natural attitude\u2026maybe they see that human beings are really attracted to this idea of having all the answers and of harnessing objective truth\u2026and religion tells them they can find those answers in the book of genesis\u2026so in order to compete with that\u2026let\u2019s sort of gloss over all the limitations of science and the human beings that ultimately have to conduct science and let\u2019s proceed as though our method is the REAL method of arriving at Objective truth. What I\u2019m saying is\u2026when you go too far down this natural attitude rabbit hole and you start looking at this stuff as though it\u2019s objective truth\u2026it starts to look eerily familiar. You know in the 1400\u2019s you had a priest that wore a big robe and conducted a ritual at an altar spoke to God and told you what the objective truth of the universe was. In today\u2019s world you have a scientist\u2026wearing a big robe (labcoat)\u2026conducting a ritual (experiement) at an altar (a labratory) speaking to the universe and telling you the objective truth about it is.\nYou never go full Natural Attitude\u2026is what I\u2019m saying.\nBut back to the story\u2026as you can imagine\u2026when word gets out that Husserl\u2019s come up with a new method of Phenomenology that may give us certainty about an external, physical world and much more by the way\u2026it attracts a lot of aspiring philosophers that see it as one piece of this radical change that we\u2019re going to have to make in philosophy if we want to move forward\u2026one of these thinkers that became a student of Husserl was named Martin Heidegger\u2026another was named Jean Paul Sartre.\nNow\u2026 in an unexpected turn of events\u2026a turn that many of Husserl\u2019s students couldn\u2019t even fully understand\u2026right around the middle of Husserl\u2019s life he does sort of an about face with his Phenomenology\u2026he takes it in the same direction so many other thinkers before him took it\u2026he loses faith in his work and becomes an Idealist.\nNow some students followed along with Husserl adopting his new work\u2026but other students were like, mm..no. No, no. Sure, Husserl this early work is far from perfect\u2026but look all it needs is a little more development in this area and some further clarifications over there\u2026 and then\u2026then it\u2019s gonna be solid. Two of the thinkers that were part of this group\u2026were Heidegger and Sartre.\nNow Heidegger\u2026as we talked about\u2026disagreed with some pretty critical aspects of Husserl\u2026not the least of which was the entire idea of consciousness at all. Again, why do we need to think about ourselves like Descartes did back in the 17th century? Like we\u2019re subjects acting upon objects\u2026or a more modern spin\u2026consciousness acting upon things in the world? No, to Heidegger\u2026 we have no reasonable basis for making that sort of assumption. Being\u2026 and the world\u2026 are a unified thing and are fundamentally inseparable from eachother.\nWell Sartre reads Heidegger and he\u2019s convinced\u2026Heidegger\u2019s right\u2026 we have no basis for assuming that we\u2019re subjects acting upon objects\u2026he\u2019s right that being and the world are a unified thing\u2026but Sartre leaves room for consciousness. To Sartre\u2026it\u2019s consciousness\u2026and the world\u2026that are fundamentally inseparable.\nSee Sartre takes a look at this long history in philosophy we\u2019ve been talking about for this entire episode and he realizes something\u2026the problem everyone seems to have\u2026 is being able to explain how things work up in this strange\u2026box inside of their head that they seem to be trapped in. They have this factory up in their heads called consciousness or whatever word they use for it\u2026and they have this receiving dock that takes in these semi-trucks full of phenomena\u2026 and these phenomena are sent down conveyor belts and the disenfranchised blue collar workers organize them and categorize them and turn them into this crude map of the world that they ship out the other side of the factory to us so we can perceive the world.\nBut think about what we talked about last time\u2026consciousness is not some empty container\u2026or some empty factory up in our heads waiting to be filled up with perceptions. The more these Phenomenologists look at consciousness the more they see it more of an activity than a thing up in our heads\u2026remember consciousness is always actional (doing something) and referential (pointing towards something)\u2026there\u2019s no such thing as some empty consciousness out there.\nSee Sartre is different from Husserl. When Husserl does his Phenomenology\u2026 he\u2019s super focused on the task of figuring out what everything is\u2026and the way he DOES that is through various methods like the Eidetic Reduction that we talked about on Heidegger part 1.\nWhat\u2026 Husserl\u2019s interested in doing\u2026is describing things in the world in terms of these universal essences that he arrives at through the Eidetic reduction\u2026but remember\u2026 Sartre doesn\u2019t come from that school of thought he would see this whole process as just a misguided extension of this outdated, old philosophy where we thought we could think about everything in terms of these neat categories and universals. No, Sartre\u2019s more focused on the individual\u2026and he thinks you can\u2019t ever know everything about an individual simply by looking at them in terms of what universal essences intersect by them.\nFor example\u2026you know it\u2019s so tempting to think that if we figure out the essence of something\u2026we know what it is\u2026that if we had a piece of wax\u2026we did the Eidetic reduction and arrived at it\u2019s universal essences\u2026that we have essentially figured out\u2026what it is to be that thing. But Sartre says, this never tells us the full story. Sartre has a famous argument in his most famous work Being and Nothingness\u2026 where he quotes a passage from the biography of the French Author Gustave Flaubert\u2026and here he\u2019s pointing out how ridiculous it is that the biographer is trying to explain the psychology of Flaubert, the psychology of a human being by using this sort of process\u2026by just appealing to a bunch of universals.\nHe says:\n\u201c\u2026 A critic, for example, wishing to explain the \u201cpsychology\u201d of Flaubert,\nwill write that he \u201cappeared in his early youth to know as his normal state,\na continual exaltation resulting from the twofold feeling of his grandiose\nambition and his invincible power \u2026. The effervescence of his young\nblood was then turned into literary passion as happens about the\neighteenth year in precocious souls who find in the energy of style or the\nintensities of fiction some way of escaping from the need of violent action\nor of intense feeling, which torments them.\u201d\n\nSo you can see what the biographers trying to do here\u2026he\u2019s trying to give his own psychoanalysis of Gustave Flaubert and the things that happened in his youth that caused him to get into writing.\n\nSartre goes on:\n\n\u201cIn this passage there is an effort to reduce the complex personality of an\nadol"}, "episode_78": {"date": "2017-6-1", "text": "Posted on June 1, 2017\nEpisode 104 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #104\u00a0on Sartre.

Just saying\u2026it\u2019s there. Today\u2019s episode is number five in a series on Sartre and Camus. I hope you love the show today.\nSo consciousness\u2026is freedom. What exactly was it that Sartre meant\u2026 when he said that because it\u2019s not obvious, right? I mean it sounds like one of those things you\u2019d say Consciousness is Freedom and people would be like, hmm yeah no I totally get where he\u2019s coming from there\u2026.but do you really? Do you? Let\u2019s talk about it for an episode and let\u2019s also talk about\u2026if Sartre is correct here\u2026that consciousness is freedom\u2026how do human beings typically respond to that reality and what does it mean\u2026for us personally\u2026when it comes to how we approach the world?\nYou know we talked about a LOT of stuff on the last episode but I hope one of the major takeaways was that throughout the history of philosophy\u2026we\u2019ve had this pretty stubborn recurring problem that just doesn\u2019t seem to go away. Turns out it\u2019s a little more difficult than you might initially think to actually prove the existence of the external, physical world. Tons of thinkers have taken a crack at it but their problems all seem to begin at the same exact place, the problem is: once you make that distinction between consciousness and the world\u2026it becomes extremely difficult to say with any level of certainty\u2026that what you\u2019re perceiving is really the world\u2026 and not just the world as it appears to you.\nRemember Descartes\u2026talking about how our senses often deceive us\u2026the stick in the water looks bent\u2026we don\u2019t have a direct awareness of the objects of the world, just how they appear to us. And this has created this dynamic throughout the history philosophy\u2026 where philosophers are kind of like these prisoners in a cage trapped up inside of their own minds. Imagine a prisoner in a cell, right outside of this cell are four walls so you can never directly see what\u2019s going on outside of the cell, but in the floor of the cell there\u2019s a hatch that opens up once a day and gives you a newspaper that tells you everything that\u2019s going on in the world outside. Solipsism would say, wait a second. How do we know this newspaper is fair and balanced? How can we know this is an accurate representation of what\u2019s going on and not written by somebody that\u2019s just trying to deceive us into thinking what they WANT us to think out there? We can\u2019t know ANYTHING about what\u2019s going on outside these four walls\u2026\nAn Idealist might say something like, alright\u2026 well maybe we can\u2019t be certain about what\u2019s going on, out there\u2026but one thing we can be certain of is the fact that we have this newspaper. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re careful, let\u2019s make sure we understand the biases we\u2019re bringing to this paper as the prisoner reading it\u2026let\u2019s make sure we try to understand the biases of the people writing the paper\u2026the ultimate point is: let\u2019s take this newspaper seriously\u2026because at least we have a newspaper\u2026 and it seems like the contents of it may be all that we ever have access to.\nHusserl would be doing some psycho thing\u2026maybe studying the structural integrity of the cell\u2026what holds it together\u2026he\u2019d be studying the hatch in the floor that delivers the newspaper\u2026\nWell Sartre would be the guy on the prison monitor looking at them through a security camera wondering how they all don\u2019t see the key hanging around their neck. Because see, TONS of thinkers over the years have tried to come up with ALL KINDS of prison break techniques to get out of this cage\u2026but Sartre would say what if consciousness is not some realm or some cage we\u2019re trapped in up in our heads\u2026what if we don\u2019t have some secondary level of awareness of the things in the world, what if consciousness and the world are a unified thing and when you LOOK at consciousness closely enough\u2026this is his way of escaping the cell\u2026what if consciousness is essentially\u2026 nothingness. Again, it\u2019s not exactly obvious what he means when it says that, but it\u2019s the reason he calls his seminal work Being and Nothingness. To understand what he means by consciousness is freedom, we have to understand what he means by consciousness is nothingness\u2026so let\u2019s get into it.\nSo part of the reason there\u2019s so much word play and qualifying going on here is that Sartre\u2019s trying to do something really difficult\u2026he\u2019s trying to merge these two ways of thinking we\u2019ve been talking about on one hand\u2026 delineating things in a very Cartesian way between consciousness and the world\u2026 while also trying to preserve Heidegger\u2019s point that being and the world are a unified thing. Now just living in the western world\u2026we\u2019re a little bit sabotaged when it comes to understanding this concept\u2026and it makes sense, when you live in a world where every sentence you say is structured in terms of subjects acting upon objects\u2026where every piece of information is framed in these subject/object terms\u2026this whole concept that Heidegger introduces about being and the world as a unified thing can be kind of confusing to wrap your head around, but try to think about it like anything ELSE that\u2019s fundamentally interconnected.\nNot that this is a perfect metaphor, because it\u2019s certainly NOT what Sartre and Heidegger are saying\u2026but just to get us thinking in these terms\u2026think about the way people conventionally talk about the mind and body as being interconnected. You know you can meditate\u2026and your body feels relaxed. You can constantly focus your mind on all the things you\u2019re miserable about and it\u2019s going to produce in your body a feeling of misery. In other words you can change the state of your mind\u2026and it goes on to change the state of your body. But it goes the other way too, right? We\u2019ve all seen that Ted talk where they talk about the power poses. Stand in front of a mirror\u2026hold your hands over your head like you just won a race\u2026and it feels like you just won a race\u2026you can change your posture and you feel better about yourself\u2026tons of ways to change the state of your body to change the state of your mind but the point is if you were trying to write a book about either ONE of these things\u2026if you tried to write a book about the mind without ever referencing the body once\u2026you can imagine how the book might be massively incomplete when you finish it\u2026almost DOOMED to failure from the start.\nWell to Sartre this is what philosophers have been doing for hundreds of years with these elaborate books written about JUST consciousness or JUST the world. Again, consciousness and the world are a unified thing\u2026 we can never comprehensively talk about either one of them without directly referencing the other\u2026 but still nonetheless, we do NEED names for them so that we can talk about the details of what they are and the names Sartre gives them are on the one hand Being-in-itself (the world) and on the other\u2026 Being-For-itself (consciousness).\nBeing in itself and Being for itself. Let\u2019s talk first about Being-in-itself.\nYou know, when teachers try to explain this concept of Being-in-itself they\u2019ll often times say to think of it as almost the same as the concept\u2026 of matter\u2026and it\u2019s not because Sartre is a scientist or that he thinks Being-in-itself is just a combination of molecules\u2026they use this word \u201cmatter\u201d because it\u2019s a general, vague term about something physical that exists without giving any details about it.\nThe way that Sartre describes Being-in-itself\u2026 is extremely similar to a description given by a guy we talked about on the first or second episode of this show\u2026a guy named Parmenides.\nParmenides famously argues really quite simply, that what is, is. And what is not, is not. Something either exists\u2026or it doesn\u2019t exist. Seems pretty reasonable. What follows from this if you\u2019re him is that something can never come into being\u2026 because in order to do that\u2026where did it come from? Non-being? That doesn\u2019t exist. But it goes the other way too, something can never go out of being because where would it be going to? Something that doesn\u2019t exist?\nThings coming and going out of being, to Parmenides\u2026 is an illusion created by our feeble senses. Things changing and time moving and even things being separate from each other are all\u2026illusions created by the senses. What follows from this for Parmenides is that what being actually is\u2026is this giant, featureless, unmoving, unchanging, inert sphere of existence\u2026and that anything else we humans try to say about it is just us imposing our feeble senses onto it. He describes it:\n\u201c\u2026 it is uncreated and imperishable, for it is entire, immovable and without\nend. It was not in the past, nor shall it be, since it is now, all at once, one,\ncontinuous; for what creation wilt thou seek for it? how and whence did it\ngrow? Nor shall I allow thee to say or to think, \u2018from that which is not\u2019; for\nit is not to be said or thought that it is not. And what need would have\ndriven it on to grow, starting from nothing, at a later time rather than an\nearlier?\u201d\n\nWell just listen\u2026 to how Sartre describes Being-in-itself at the beginning of Being and Nothingness:\n\n\u201cTransition, becoming, anything that permits us to say that being is not yet what it will be and that it is already what it is not \u2014 all that is forbidden on principle\u2026. It is full positivity. It knows no otherness; it never posits itself as other-than-another-being\u2026it is not\nsubject to temporality\u201d\n\nSo, this picture that Sartre presents of being-in-itself\u2026is not much different than the way Parmenides describes being as a giant, timeless, featureless, unchanging, inert blob of existence. When Sartre says in that quote that being-in-itself is FULL positivity\u2026he means more or less the same thing Parmenides means when he says what is, is and what is not, is not. Being-in-itself is what is\u2026any talk about what is not has nothing to do with it. In other words, Being-in-itself is fully positive or affirmative in it\u2019s existence, it doesn\u2019t depend on anything for it\u2019s existence, it doesn\u2019t exist AS OPPOSED to some OTHER being out there\u2026hypothetically speaking you could fully describe Being-in-itself without ever using the word \u201cnot\u201d or ever referencing something that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nWhen it comes to Being-in-itself, what is, is. And what is not, is not. Things like motion and change and time are all\u2026 NOT\u2026 aspects of this Being-in-itself. And while BOTH Parmenides and Sartre arrive at this same place\u2026the DIFFERENCE between them\u2026 is that while\u2026 Parmenides arrives at this place, sees all this motion and change and things seemingly coming and going out of being in the world, and HE writes all this stuff off as a paradoxical illusion created by the senses\u2026Sartre explains all these things\u2026 as the WAYS that consciousness interacts with the world. Or in other words: the way that Being-For-Itself interacts with Being-in-itself.\n\nConsciousness as being for itself\u2026the world, matter, as Being-in-itself.\n\nNow given the fact that Being-in-itself is FULL positivity. Fully affirmative. Consciousness\u2026or Being-For-Itself\u2026is what allows us to consider the other side of that\u2026what is not. Now let\u2019s get out of describing this stuff in this \u201cis and is not\u201d way the point is\u2026 that if consciousness allows us to consider what is not\u2026you can start to see the direction this is heading in of consciousness being nothingness.\n\nConsciousness, to Sartre, is not a box\u2026it\u2019s not a cage up in our heads that we\u2019re trapped in\u2026consciousness is an activity\u2026an activity of pure directedness towards Being-in-itself\u2026pure intentionality. The big move here\u2026is that unlike Descartes\u2026who talks about us not having access to the things of the world but only the way that they appear to us\u2026and how that whole strategy effectively locks us up in our heads trying to decipher these mere APPEARANCES of things\u2026you know it\u2019s a three step process\u2026there\u2019s the actual things, the appearances of the things and then there\u2019s us sitting up in our head trying to decode them. Sartre cuts out the middle man. Yes, things still APPEAR to consciousness in a particular way, but the OBJECTS of consciousness ARE the things in the world, not this sort of internal picture being projected up in our heads that was CAUSED by the things outside of our heads like so many philosophers have assumed.\n\nSo let\u2019s just try to picture consciousness then. Picture rays of light, coming out of a flashlight, illuminating a little circle of things in an otherwise dark room, except\u2026here\u2019s where it get\u2019s weird. Picture there\u2019s no flashlight causing these light rays, that was an assumption too\u2026and consider the fact that consciousness doesn\u2019t just passively reveal things in the dark room like the light-rays do, consciousness reveals things based on a very particular scheme that we can study. Picture light-rays\u2026 as if they were animated by something that gives them a particular structure\u2026but it\u2019s even WEIRDER than that\u2026because to even picture light-rays is to be picturing some\u2026thing\u2026this apparatus made up of photons interacting with the objects in the room. But consciousness isn\u2019t some\u2026thing. It\u2019s an activity of pure awareness and what follows from that if you\u2019re Sartre is that other than this strange relationship between consciousness and the objects it\u2019s revealing\u2026consciousness\u2026is nothing really. Consciousness\u2026is nothingness.\n\nBut it\u2019s nothingness in another sense too, it\u2019s nothingness in that\u2026 it\u2019s the source of all nothingness\u2026 in our experience of the world to Sartre\u2026the feeling that something\u2019s lacking, of what is not\u2026it\u2019s the source of something about the way we interpret the world that at this point is an age old problem in philosophy\u2026 called The Problem of Negation.\n\nHere\u2019s an example Sartre uses: Let\u2019s say you were going to meet your friend Pierre at a bar. Let\u2019s say you get there and Pierre hasn\u2019t gotten there yet, and when you get there and you turn your consciousness towards the bar and you examine whether Pierre\u2019s there or not\u2026you don\u2019t go ok I see 5 tables, 10 chairs, some glasses, some pictures on the wall, tiles on the floor, lights, a man in a nice hat, some alcohol behind the counter\u2026you know I\u2019ve taken a pretty exhaustive inventory of this place and I just don\u2019t see Pierre on this list of things.\n\nNo, what actually happens is\u2026you look around and you perceive a sort of\u2026lack of Pierre. In other words, if you walked in the bar and Pierre was sitting there\u2026it would be a FULL positivity, affirmative, being-in-itself style fact that Pierre is sitting in the bar. But when Pierre isn\u2019t there, what you end up getting access to is a weird sort of \u201cnegative fact\u201d. An awareness of a non-Pierreness. An absence of Pierre, but what is that really, what exactly are we conscious of there? These sort of \u201cnegative facts\u201d as they\u2019re called deeply worried thinkers like Parmenides who went so far as to say that you can\u2019t even SPEAK of what is not without being contradictory. For Sartre one things for certain\u2026this awareness of what is not DIDN\u2019T come from being-in-itself\u2026no, to be able to see this lack or negation or nothingness\u2026 of non-Pierre in the bar, we get that from consciousness. Consciousness is the source of nothingness in our awareness of the world.\n\nNow if you\u2019re someone out there saying, OK, this is all very interesting but it\u2019s also all very deep and analytical. Look\u2026you can explain it \u2019til you\u2019re blue in the face Sartre, but if consciousness is this way on this fundamental level\u2026is there any way on a more practical level I can experience this nothingness of consciousness? And it\u2019s almost like I wrote that question ahead of time\u2026it turns out\u2026THERE IS! Several different situations that we can ALL relate to.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about a couple of them. Two of the more famous ones are often called The Gambler and Vertigo. Let\u2019s talk about the gambler.\n\nSartre says to imagine a guy that\u2019s a compulsive gambler. He goes down to the casino every day and gambles all of his money away. His family\u2019s struggling\u2026his children are starving and he realizes something has to change about this whole scenario\u2026so he makes a resolution to never gamble again for the rest of his life. But then the next day he goes down to the casino\u2026always a wise move\u2026he walks past the gambling table, and that demon\u2026 that demon starts talking to him, oh maybe we could gamble a little bit. No, no I need to stop. This is ruining my family, this is ruining my life\u2026but maybe if I just made a really small bet\u2026\n\nSartre writes about his inner monologue as he looks back at the compulsive gambler he used to be he says:\n\n\u201cThat man back there in the past is me. It\u2019s not someone else, after all; I\nrecognize myself in that past man. And yet, in the sense that matters right\nnow, that man is not me. That man has good resolutions that speak to him\nand are persuasive. But those resolutions do not affect me one bit, unless I\nmake those resolutions anew \u2014 now. I do not find his resolutions affecting\nme.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying here is here\u2019s this compulsive gambler that\u2019s trying to stop\u2026looking into the past at the man he used to be\u2026thinking about the moment he decided to stop gambling and all the resolutions he made to himself never going to do it again. But now he finds himself in THIS moment\u2026and while in one sense that person in the past that decided to stop gambling IS him\u2026but for all intents and purposes\u2026that guy that made those resolutions\u2026 is essentially a different person in a different time and place.\n\nHe realizes that all those resolutions he made that day\u2026 mean NOTHING\u2026 if he doesn\u2019t in each and every moment make those very SAME resolutions. Now you can imagine this with weight loss or drinking or meditating twice a day but the point is: Sartre would want us to ask\u2026when we make these changes for the better in our lives\u2026and we look back at the person we used to be\u2026what is stopping us, in this very moment, from going back and becoming that person again? What\u2019s stopping us from going back to the gambling table or the bar or the fast food drive through? Well Sartre would say\u2026nothing. Nothing\u2026is stopping you. And it\u2019s THAT realization\u2026that at any moment you could choose to go back to living in your own little personal hell that you created\u2026that reality produces in us a feeling that Sartre calls Anguish. Not a good feeling.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk more about it in a second but let\u2019s talk about Vertigo. New story.\n\nA person\u2019s going on a walk one day\u2026 and they come to the edge of a giant cliff\u2026and they look down\u2026400 foot drop\u2026they see the ravine below\u2026jagged rocks\u2026and all of a sudden their palms start sweating and tingling and they get a little dizzy and so they back up away from the edge don\u2019t look down there. Well, what just went on there, why did their body react that way?\n\nWell the default answer might be to say that, look\u2026I\u2019m at the edge of a cliff\u2026I looked down and it doesn\u2019t look very fun down there\u2026I was scared I was going to fall. But Sartre would say, it wasn\u2019t that you were scared to fall\u2026it was that you were scared about the possibility that you could JUMP.\n\nJust like the Gambler looked into the past\u2026what happened was you looked into the future\u2026you saw yourself laying there at the bottom of the cliff looking like a human swatstika\u2026just mangled from the fall\u2026you looked at that person in the future\u2026and while in one sense that person is a completely different person in a different time and place\u2026in another sense\u2026all it would take is one choice, about 15 seconds and the effects of gravity to TURN you into that person. In other words, what\u2019s stopping you in this moment from hurling yourself off the cliff to your death\u2026nothing. Nothing is stopping you.\n\nLook, if there was some essence that preceded your existence maybe you wouldn\u2019t have the CHOICE to jump off the cliff, but the fact is you DO have a choice. We ALWAYS have a choice. And the fact that NOTHING stops the gambler from going back to the tables and NOTHING stops the person from throwing themselves off the cliff and that NOTHING is stopping anyone listening to this from being the best or worst person they could ever possibly be\u2026this nothingness\u2026when you think about it, it ends up just being another word for freedom. Consciousness\u2026is freedom. And when we\u2019re hit with this reality\u2026that every second of every day is a choice moving in the direction of our potential bad OR good selves\u2026when we TRULY face that fact\u2026it doesn\u2019t make us happy like we just got out of jail\u2026it\u2019s terrifying to us. It produces in us that feeling that Sartre calls Anguish.\n\nWe feel a sense of Anguish\u2026when we truly consider just how much freedom we have to choose and how responsible we are for our actions\u2026and Sartre says most people spend their entire lives coming up with all kinds of creative ways to tell themselves a story\u2026 blaming their behavior on something other than themselves, all in an attempt to ESCAPE, this feeling of anguish.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about a few of the ways\u2026 Sartre thinks people shift this blame off themselves and pretend like they didn\u2019t have a choice\u2026one of them happens to be a prevailing idea in the field of psychology during Sartre\u2019s life\u2026it\u2019s the Freudian idea of the unconscious mind people will tell themselves\u2026I did something\u2026but it wasn\u2019t really fully ME that made the choice to do it\u2026see I have this thing called my unconscious mind up in my brain that affects and sometimes even GOVERNS my decision making.\n\nSartre uses an example like\u2026say you were walking out of a restaurant and you see a little girl bleeding out of her head on the sidewalk looking for help. Now most of us\u2026 when faced with this situation\u2026 consciously think\u2026oh, here\u2019s a girl that needs help. I care about this girl. I\u2019m a good person. The right thing to do here is to help this little girl. And then we do it.\n\nNow a common criticism of this description of what\u2019s going on there is that what really happened\u2026is that you saw a little girl bleeding out of her head\u2026that visual produced in you a very unpleasant feeling of distress and worry\u2026and you went over to help the girl really on a self-interested mission to get rid of that distress and worry. In other words, consciously you told yourself that you\u2019re a good person and what you like to do is help people who are in need\u2026but unconsciously\u2026you were acting in a self-interested way.\n\nNow nobody gets hurt in this example, but you can imagine how having this cordoned off place up in your head called \u201cthe unconscious mind\u201d\u2026 that we have no awareness of when making choices but nonetheless sometimes governs our behavior\u2026you can imagine how people might sometimes use that as a way of taking the blame off of themselves and not admitting that they were free to make another choice\u2026you can imagine how Sartre might have a problem with it.\n\nAnd an important thing to note is\u2026it certainly may be true that most of the stuff we do is done without us directly reflecting on it\u2026the thing Sartre wants to avoid is people using this \u201cunconscious mind\u201d as a scapegoat that they can evoke any time they want to justify horrible behavior.\n\nPolice talking to you:\n\nSir, what happened here?\n\nYes I trampled that small child\u2026but you know when I heard the fire alarm I had this unconscious natural urge to protect myself and my kids and everything else went out the window.\n\nPolice talking to you again:\n\nLook man I was just sitting there this guy rolled up and I said bro, you better get out of my face and then unconsciously bam! I laid him out. Unconsciously\u2026I just had this instinct to protect myself.\n\nThis is what he\u2019s trying to avoid\u2026and think about it\u2026is it absolutely necessary to have this hidden realm called the unconscious mind that we have no awareness of?\n\nSartre would say that sure, it is true that seeing the little girl makes me feel distressed and worried. And it\u2019s true, that helping the little girl removes this feeling of distress and worry that I have. But what\u2019s ALSO true\u2026is that once I help the little girl rub some dirt on the wound and wrap it up in a giant bandage\u2026how convenient\u2026that I\u2019m never surprised at that point\u2026 that I feel good about myself and that these bad feelings have left me. It\u2019s almost like\u2026I was always aware of the fact I was acting selfishly\u2026I just wasn\u2019t reflecting on it in that moment. It\u2019s almost like this motive wasn\u2019t hidden away in some unconscious mind that I have no awareness of\u2026but that I was just aware of it in a different way.\n\nSartre makes the distinction that consciousness is not this single wave of awareness like many psychologists assume that every consciousness has what he calls both positional and non-positional awareness\u2026but the ultimate goal\u2026 that Sartre has here is to do away with this mysterious and unnecessary realm called \u201cthe unconscious mind\u201d\u2026 that supposedly can dictate behavior with motives that are IMPOSSIBLE to be conscious of oh, and by the way\u2026can be evoked at any moment\u2026 to allow people to escape from the Anguish of how truly free they are.\n\nNow the unconscious mind is just one of these clever ways people have come up with to avoid responsibility. Sartre says people do it with all kinds of other stuff\u2026people do it with a God that has a plan for them\u2026they\u2019ll do it by reducing themselves to some social role\u2026you know, I\u2019m just a carpenter that\u2019s all\u2026the point is\u2026there\u2019s no shortage of these creative ways people have come up with to avoid how truly free they are and how responsible they are for their actions. And one of the most common things people will use as an excuse for why they behaved in a particular way that they didn\u2019t have total control over\u2026are their emotions. Sartre writes an ENTIRE book on emotions\u2026talks about them in several others.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a tempting place to take issue with Sartre, right? I mean when you hear somebody make a radical claim like that\u2026that we\u2019re TOTALLY free and ABSOLUTELY responsible for our behavior\u2026one of the first places you might go is to say look, I\u2019m down with freedom and responsibility\u2026but let\u2019s face it\u2026we aren\u2019t TOTALLY free\u2026fact is, we are emotional beings\u2026sometimes we get overwhelmed by emotions, sometimes these emotions cause us to behave in crazy ways.\n\nBut Sartre wouldn\u2019t agree. Sartre would say that emotions, ultimately are choices that we make.\n\nLet me explain what he means: he\u2019s responding to a really common way that people look at emotions. The basic idea is that what happens when we have an emotion\u2026is that we have some perception\u2026for example, we see a news story about someone getting stabbed\u2026it CAUSES us to have a particular physiological response\u2026our stomach drops, we get butterflies, blood rushes to our face\u2026and then we become aware of that physiological response and just sort of marinate in it\u2026until it goes away or we use some mental trickery to get rid of it. Point is: our awareness of that physiological response that was CAUSED by some perception\u2026that is WHAT the emotion is.\n\nBut Sartre would say, it\u2019s not that simple. The first thing he\u2019d want to point out that isn\u2019t explicitly stated in that theory is that emotions\u2026 are\u2026 intentional. In the same way consciousness is always consciousness OF something\u2026it has intentionality\u2026and that there\u2019s no empty consciousness out there not directed at anything\u2026emotions are the same way. Whenever you\u2019re angry\u2026you\u2019re ANGRY about something that happened. Whenever you\u2019re sad\u2026you\u2019re sad ABOUT something\u2026for example, a story on the news of somebody getting stabbed. Point is: When you say that you\u2019re sad\u2026you\u2019re not just in some \u201cphysiological STATE of sadness\u201d\u2026you\u2019re always sad ABOUT something\u2026some state of affairs happened in the world\u2026and then that sadness came about.\n\nWell WHY did it come about? It\u2019s tempting to say that it was against our will\u2026that I SAW the story on the news and it CAUSED me to be sad. But Sartre would say what\u2019s REALLY going on\u2026whether we realize it or not\u2026is that we use our emotions as strategies\u2026strategies that we employ to escape some otherwise unpleasant situation in the world\u2026in the event we CAN\u2019T totally escape the situation\u2026the emotion at least makes us feel better off than we would otherwise be.\n\nNow at first this may seem just downright counter-intuitive. My emotions aren\u2019t strategies that I\u2019m using\u2026I don\u2019t even THINK about them. Well just picture for a second what it looks like when people DO use emotions in an overtly strategic way\u2026for example imagine a super manipulative person\u2026you go to a restaurant\u2026they wanted to go to a different restaurant. *sigh* I\u2019m so sad. Look at me and how sad I am\u2026if only someone took me to a different restaurant I might feel better. Now this isn\u2019t what Sartre says we\u2019re doing I\u2019m just giving an example of how even FEIGNED emotions can be used as strategies to bring about a particular end and that maybe emotions are more than just some force within us that leads to an involuntary physiological response.\n\nSartre would say\u2026that when the guy cuts you off in traffic\u2026most likely it was an accident but for the sake of this example let\u2019s imagine he cut you off on purpose\u2026he was staring you directly in the eyes through the back window of his car as he cut you off\u2026well what exactly happened there? Well this guy was really inconsiderate of you. He put your life in jeopardy\u2026other motorists lives in jeopardy\u2026he essentially just reduced you to this sub-human level where you don\u2019t even deserve the space on the road as much as he does\u2026that\u2019s basically HIS road\u2026and you\u2019re this little insect that\u2019s in the way. That guy\u2019s preference of which lane he wants to drive in\u2026 is ESSENTIALLY more important than your overall safety and well being. That\u2019s you now.\n\nThis is a particular state of affairs that you can possibly be faced with\u2026and how do people sometimes respond when they\u2019re faced with this scenario? They get ANGRY. Why do they get angry? Well to Sartre, it\u2019s a strategy they\u2019re using. Because let\u2019s say you really looked at someone cutting you off in traffic in that way I just described\u2026you\u2019ve got a few options\u2026you can sit there\u2026and just revel in this new status this guy has just given you\u2026as this insect that\u2019s just in the way of this guy\u2019s 1987 Honda Accord\u2026an insect that doesn\u2019t even deserve the consideration of their own space on the road\u2026or, what else can you do? You can get ANGRY. Yeah. You can feel indignant! Now, instead of being this little insect\u2026I\u2019ve RESTORED my honor as a human being! This guy\u2019s got expectations that THAT guy\u2019s not living up to. And he should feel HORRIBLE for being such a worse driver than me\u2026how DARE he be so inconsiderate of somebody that\u2019s so much more important than an insect.\n\nBeing angry can be an uncomfortable feeling\u2026but it\u2019s a much MORE comfortable feeling than being sub-human and just in the way of the REAL people\u2026to Sartre, we EVOKE the emotion of ANGER (and ALL emotions for that matter) as a strategy to ESCAPE from an unpleasant situation.\n\nEven positive emotions\u2026you know when somebody\u2019s going throughout their day and they\u2019re WALKING on sunshine\u2026nothing can bother me today, I\u2019m in TOO GOOD of a mood! Sartre would say That person\u2019s doing that as a way of escaping the reality of being a human being\u2026that we DO have responsibilities and obligations\u2026we DO have things that annoy and inconvenience us. Emotions, whether we realize it or not, are choices. We may not have something happen to us and then say to ourselves, OK I\u2019m going to be sad now to cope with this GO! But these ARE strategies that we\u2019re using and how convenient\u2026that people that HAVE alternative coping skills\u2026are less moody people!\n\nAgain, what Sartre\u2019s ultimately trying to get away from here are people making excuses for their behavior, blaming their emotional state and denying the true level of freedom that they have. You know, it\u2019s so easy to say, hey sorry I acted that way, I\u2019m an angry person. But Sartre would say: no you\u2019re not. Where did THAT come from? There\u2019s no essence to your being given to you by some creator that makes you a more ANGRY person than everyone else out there. Maybe you\u2019re not Angry because you\u2019re an Angry person, but instead\u2026 maybe you\u2019re an angry person because you consistently choose anger as a response to cope with things that happen to you. Maybe you\u2019re NOT a slave. Maybe you HAVE a choice. Maybe your consciousness is not something being constantly controlled by some powerful force called \u201cemotion\u201d\u2026maybe in reality\u2026consciousness is freedom.\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_79": {"date": "2017-7-11", "text": "Posted on July 11, 2017\nEpisode 105 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #105\u00a0on Sartre. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo in a culture where there\u2019s so much social currency connected to being a victim\u2026 and having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life\u2026there may be some of you out there that feel a little left out\u2026maybe you\u2019re the kind of person, you look at yourself\u2026and you don\u2019t feel like a victim\u2026maybe you don\u2019t sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past\u2026well ENOUGH of that crazy talk, get off the bench because your uncle steve\u2019s putting you in the game. I\u2019m here to tell you\u2026Rest assured my friend\u2026you ARE a victim. Turns out, we\u2019re ALL victims just by virtue of being born because just\u2026think\u2026for a second about how horrible the world was for us\u2026when we were all babies.\n\nThink of what it\u2019s like being a baby, imagine going through something similar today and if you made it out the other side TELL me you wouldn\u2019t be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it.\n\nThink about it\u2026you didn\u2019t CHOOSE to be born. Imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about. You find yourself once you get on that planet\u2026absorbed into some tribe\u2026you don\u2019t speak the language\u2026you have no idea what anything is\u2026you think the remote control to their TV is food\u2026and you\u2019re completely defenseless.\n\nAnd who do you have as teachers, on this journey? What\u2026just some random man and woman that happen to look like you? They didn\u2019t go to school for this stuff\u2026being a baby is like going to the world\u2019s worst community college where they don\u2019t even have teachers\u2026they just pull some random people off the street and say \u201cteach these kids about rocket science, GO!\u201d Except it\u2019s worse than that\u2026we\u2019re not just learning about rocket science\u2026we\u2019re learning everything about what it is to exist. How we look at other people, how we look at the world, how we look at our selves within that world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: the struggle for us former babies\u2026was real. And I think it\u2019s safe to say that when you\u2019re living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just trying to figure things out\u2026no one\u2019s really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you. There\u2019s a lot to figure out, and a lot of these ways we\u2019ve LEARNED to make sense of this stuff is totally arbitrary. A lot of the ways that we think about stuff\u2026have been just sort of, almost by accident, PASSED DOWN from generation to generation.\n\nPhilosophers realized this\u2026and at the time of Sartre, for over 300 years people had been pointing out\u2026 how MANY of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative\u2026 from the way Christianity describes being a human being. That\u2019s how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then\u2026and that even if you\u2019ve never been to church, even if your family\u2019s 15 generations removed from ever stepping foot in a church\u2026 some of these things are so foundational, that generation after generation of confused baby trying to figure things out\u2026just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in Christianity, for example.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life. Right, like for example they\u2019ll say\u2026ok, so I need to choose a career path for my life, I need to declare a major. Big decision\u2026what do I do? Well whenever I think about it I just don\u2019t, know what I want I certainly have it narrowed down to a few options\u2026but I just can\u2019t make that big decision. I don\u2019t know exactly what I want, and yeah, I don\u2019t spend that much time thinking about it, but I have faith it\u2019s gonna come to me. I have faith that I\u2019m gonna wake up one day somethings gonna happen to me, some life event\u2026and then I\u2019m gonna know. I\u2019m gonna realize my calling in life in that moment.\n\nPeople do this same thing with relationships. They\u2019ll say I have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone\u2026don\u2019t know EXACTLY what they look like what they\u2019re gonna be like\u2026but I\u2019m confident\u2026one day I\u2019m gonna meet someone\u2026 and there\u2019s gonna be this moment when I look at them and I realize they\u2019re the person I wanna spend the rest of my life with. People do this with anything\u2026they\u2019ll do it with motivational videos on YouTube\u2026one day I\u2019m gonna watch the right person screaming at me to be better\u2026 and from then on out it\u2019s gonna be EASY to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life\u2026in other words: there\u2019s a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices\u2026 that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence. That a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life\u2026is that one day you\u2019re going to wake up\u2026and there\u2019s going to be some event\u2026some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment\u2026 where you realize the divinity of Jesus and if you have any further questions about the nature of existence just forward them to the Pope\u2019s inbox. That\u2019s a REASONABLE thing to expect, in that worldview.\n\nWell this isn\u2019t the only\u2026example of these long lost remnants of Christianity in our thinking. And another major one\u2026 another one that a LOT of people in today\u2019s world still use to make sense of things\u2026is the way that they look at themselves and who they are. Just like in Christianity\u2026where yes you have a body\u2026but your TRUE self\u2026 is a soul, it\u2019s an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that YOU have an intimate access to\u2026just like that, a lot of people in today\u2019s world think of their true SELF\u2026or the answer to the question: who are you? As a personality\u2026 hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to\u2026you know they\u2019ll say things like sure\u2026when I\u2019m out in public I DO kind of put on a mask for the sake of social utility, I admit it. I don\u2019t act like my 100% TRUE self in the Starbucks drivethru\u2026I tell people things they want to hear, I play the game because look\u2026 fact is: it\u2019s just not useful, not to mention I don\u2019t really feel comfortable giving 100% of my true self to the person in the Starbucks drivethrough. Who am I really? Well that\u2019s something I reserve for my closest friends. In fact even some of my closest friends don\u2019t know everything about the depths of what it is to be me. Maybe for some of you out there\u2026there\u2019s only one other person in this entire WORLD that has full access to this TRUE SELF hidden deep within you.\n\nBut Sartre would say, is this really how the self works? Is the self really like the Christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to? Sartre would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go to work for the sake of pragmatism\u2026and it very well may be that you\u2019ve reflected on yourself and you have this idea of who you are inside your head that\u2019s only accessed by you and your closest friends. But don\u2019t ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there. Maybe you\u2019re telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you\u2019re telling the Starbucks barista a story.\n\nThis concept is a common one in existentialism\u2026it\u2019s actually one of the main themes in Dostoyevsky\u2019s book Crime and Punishment\u2026the idea that, you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do. Two examples of this, bear with me for a second the first one\u2019s a little cartoonish\u2026 but I think it\u2019s a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we look at the self and it get\u2019s us to honestly start asking this question: where is this self that we\u2019re talking about REALLY located?\n\nImagine a guy that thinks he\u2019s Napoleon. He spends all day every day dressing up in Parisian military garb, making a fort out of couch cushions in his front room, talking to himself agonizing over how he\u2019s going to conquer Moscow. Now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is Napoleon. If you asked him candidly\u2026no but who are you really, deep down inside? He would say I am Napoleon Bonaparte. Commander of the armies of the north. Husband to a murdered wife, father to a murdered son. And I will have my vengeance. But is this man really Napoleon? WE know he\u2019s not Napoleon. In fact in a weird way, as outsiders, we seem to have an ADVANTAGE when it comes to knowing who he really is. Interesting.\n\nHere\u2019s the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you. Imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching the TV with his pals. They turn on the news and there\u2019s a story about a mass shooting that just happened at a Walmart somewhere. He hears the story, gets a little angry, turns to his friends and says you know what? That guy and people like him better HOPE he never shows up at my Walmart. Someone pulls out a gun when I\u2019m there, I\u2019m not gonna be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store\u2026I\u2019m going to the Sporting Goods section. I\u2019m gonna go up into the rafters like I\u2019m Tom Cruise repel down and snap his neck. I\u2019m gonna do this\u2026because that\u2019s just the kind of person I am, that\u2019s me\u2026I\u2019d sacrifice my life for the greater good. Now he may tell his friends this\u2026he may believe that that is who he is deep down beyond a SHADOW of a doubt\u2026but if next Saturday he\u2019s out shopping with his family, someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a poof of smoke and him running out the back door\u2026who is that guy REALLY?\n\nIn other words: when we reference this thing we call our \u201cself\u201d. Intuitively it can feel like well I AM my self. I know who I am, so no one can tell me who I am but me. In fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like, YEAH! You tell \u2018em! Only YOU know who you are deep down inside! But is that a delusion? Is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self?\n\nSartre says that when you take a closer look at the self\u2026it\u2019s not a soul\u2026it\u2019s not a personality hidden deep within you\u2026what we\u2019re referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts. And I think a good place to begin if we want to understand Sartre\u2019s views on what the self REALLY is\u2026is to talk about two foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to Sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other\u2026what he calls our Facticity and our Transcendence.\n\nIf you are a human being that is alive, right now\u2026you have both Facticity and Transcendence, put very simply: our Facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment\u2026and Transcendence is our ability to change or the possibilities that we have at our disposal. Let\u2019s break it down further though: remember last time when we talked about being-in-itself vs being-for-itself? Being in itself as being kind of like matter\u2026this inert, featureless, blob of existence, fully affirmative. And being for itself as being consciousness\u2026or the source of all negation. Well when Sartre\u2019s trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions\u2026the way he DESCRIBES the relationship between these two ontological categories is that being in itself: is what it is. And being for itself: is what it is not. Well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum, after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it.\n\nBut then Sartre points out something very, mysterious\u2026a very strange coincidence. When you look at the relationship between these two ontological categories\u2026two things that are easy to write off as these meaningless abstract concepts that Sartre cooked up one day\u2026when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to eachother\u2026Sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people.\n\nSee because, on one hand, all of us have our Facticity\u2026.and Facticity is kind of like being in itself\u2026it\u2019s the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us. You ask me who I am\u2026.and I say things like oh, well I\u2019m 117 years old, that\u2019s a fact. I am a horse wrangler by profession, that\u2019s a fact. I make 28,000 dollars per year, I drive a Ford Focus and I\u2019m scared of spiders, things like that. In other words, statements of facts that are currently true about us, this is what makes up our Facticity.\n\nBut what Sartre would want us to consider\u2026is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who I am\u2026they never tell us the full story right? And the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that\u2026to fully understand a human being\u2026just BY DEFAULT is to understand a type of being that has possibilities\u2026none of us are PURE Facticity\u2026the only time a human being is PURE Facticity is when they\u2019re DEAD\u2026yes, we have a set of facts that are true about us right now, but we ALWAYS have the ability to change into something else\u2026and if we\u2019re trying to describe a self\u2026if we\u2019re looking at the WHOLE picture of who someone is\u2026the choices we make about which of these possibilities we\u2019re going to bring about, end up being JUST as important as the facts about who we are right now, for example.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to school to become an IT consultant\u2026or if I\u2019m training for a marathon\u2026or if I\u2019m losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures\u2026a big part of understanding who I am is understanding the thing I\u2019m actively trying to change into\u2026an IT consultant, a marathon runner, the flower girl at a wedding. In other words, part of understanding the full picture of ME is understanding what I am not yet. You can start to hear the weird Sartre description creeping in\u2026just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not\u2026in a sense\u2026I am what I am, I have a Facticity\u2026but I also am what I am not yet when I consider my transcendence.\n\nJust like being in itself and being for itself\u2026these two aspects of what it is to be a human being, Facticity and Transcendence, are entangled, intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence. Your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other\u2026and that\u2019s because the facts of your life are often times caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you\u2019ve decided to explore are almost always limited by the FACTS of your life, let\u2019s stop with the hypotheticals and give a real example.\n\nMe. I\u2019ll use me as an example. I am six feet tall 172.2 pounds this morning. No matter HOW MUCH I want to\u2026I am never going to become a horse jockey. It\u2019s just not going to happen for me. As long as there are people out there that are 4\u20198\u201d 85 lbs\u2026the facticity that I\u2019m a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend\u2026and the result of that is: I\u2019m never winning the Kentucky Derby. This is an example of how our ability to transcend is often times limited by the facts about us. Another example\u2026I was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle. No matter HOW MUCH I want to\u2026I am never going to be an Instagram model. The facticity of my face\u2026my faceticity\u2026and all the stuff that\u2019s going on there\u2026I will never be the kind of person that people voluntarily want to look at and click an emoji that signifies how they\u2019re feeling about the most recent picture of me. It\u2019s just not gonna happen and these facts about me are the parameters I live my life and exercise my freedom within.\n\nSee because that\u2019s the thing, and this goes for all of you out there\u2026When Sartre talks about radical freedom\u2026when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose\u2026we\u2019re never talking about TOTAL freedom\u2026right? It\u2019s always freedom within certain limitations. We often say things like, \u201cI can do whatever I want to do.\u201d But you can\u2019t REALLY do anything you want to do\u2026right, I mean ultimately you\u2019re a human being\u2026you can\u2019t wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then emerge a unicorn in three days. You can\u2019t fly to the edge of the universe and look at what\u2019s on the other side. No, freedom is always freedom within certain limitations\u2026 and it\u2019s those limitations that give a LOT of what you choose to do in life it\u2019s value.\n\nWe see this\u2026 in all the various different forms of art\u2026you know when someone writes a really good Haiku\u2026we see it as good NOT because they\u2019re the greatest words that could ever have possibly been strung together\u2026the beauty of the Haiku is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose. Five syllables, seven syllables, five syllables, go. In other words, the limitations are a big part of what makes the Haiku beautiful, and this applies to life as well.\n\nThe facticity that you were born into, your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life. So try to live your life like it\u2019s a piece of art you\u2019re creating. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve just accepted that I\u2019m never gonna be an Instagram model..I mean, it\u2019s like anything you just learn to adjust. Like I literally wear all of my hooded sweatshirts backwards now\u2026so that if any field trips pass by any small children come around I can just pull it over my face, nobodies gotta get scared.. So yeah, you just find little ways\u2026but yeah, ultimately the point Sartre\u2019s going to make here with the concepts of Facticity and Transcendence\u2026is not only stop thinking about your self as though it\u2019s this artifact hidden deep within you in a vault, but also stop thinking about who you are as though it\u2019s this static, unchanging thing that you can point to.\n\nThat who you are\u2026 is always in a state\u2026 of constant change, sometimes small changes, sometimes bigger changes, but always CHANGING and in flux. But don\u2019t go extreme in the other way\u2026don\u2019t start thinking of your self as this ethereal thing that can never be defined. Again, all the way up until the day you die\u2026 when you\u2019re finally turned into TOTAL Facticity\u2026you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about. Unless if you\u2019re dead\u2026you\u2019ve never arrived at a destination as a human being.\n\nNow at first glance this may seem like Sartre\u2019s writing a self help book. No single fact about you sums up who you are! Release your inner transcendence! No. Like we touched on last time Sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they\u2019re free to choose from\u2026most of the time they don\u2019t get excited\u2026they\u2019re horrified by it. In fact most of the time once people realize this stuff\u2026Sartre thinks that the secret, covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not\u2026is to escape this duality\u2026it\u2019s to turn themselves into either PURE facticity or PURE transcendence, or as Sartre says\u2026we all secretly want to become God.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what he means by that. Think about the way followers of the Abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at God, what is it like to be God? Well God is perfect. God is in this moment everything he will ever be. If God had a job interview\u2026and the person asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019d change about yourself?\u201d God LITERALLY doesn\u2019t have an answer to that question. But then on the other hand\u2026God is all powerful\u2026with the snap of his fingers\u2026he can do\u2026anything, he wants to do. In other words, in this old style, traditional view of what God is\u2026on one hand\u2026God is perfect as he is\u2026PURE facticity. But on the other hand God is all powerful and capable of bringing about ANY possibility he wants\u2026in other words PURE transcendence. Sartre would say this is no coincidence\u2026.and it\u2019s also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves\u2026 either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are PERFECT as they are right now\u2026or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about who they are and stay lost in unattainable dreams their entire life.\n\nThis is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on Sartre. The primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into PURE Facticity or PURE transcendence like God\u2026is something that Sartre calls Bad Faith. Let\u2019s look at the most famous example of Bad Faith Sartre gives and because we already talked about it in the other episode, I\u2019ll keep it brief. Sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a caf\u00e9 in Paris watching a waiter as he does his job. You can imagine a waiter in the 1940\u2019s dressed up in his little outfit\u2026very upright, good posture, very proper\u2026he holds the tray in a particular way, he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic, particular way just like a good waiter does\u2026Sartre can\u2019t help but point out\u2026that this guy doesn\u2019t seem to be a \u201cself\u201d with Facticity and Transcendence in this moment\u2026he seems to have relegated himself to just, playing the part of a waiter. He\u2019s going through the motions turning himself into pure facticity\u2026just a waiter and nothing else.\n\nNow even though waiters don\u2019t act like this often in today\u2019s world\u2026go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what Sartre\u2019s talking about here\u2026there\u2019s so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of this same person that seems to be the modern archetype of what it is to be a server\u2026they all say the same stuff: Hi, I\u2019m John I\u2019m gonna be taking care of you today. Can I get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks? Later on, How\u2019s everything tasting for you? You save room for desert? I\u2019m just gonna leave this here absolutely no rush on the check I\u2019m gonna be over here I\u2019ll take a looksy back at you\u2026ask yourself: is this the way this guy talks to his mom? Is this the way he talks to his best friends? No. He\u2019s fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server.\n\nNow the point Sartre\u2019s making here is not that waiters need to be more creative, it\u2019s not about waiters. Sartre thinks that as human beings\u2026 we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap\u2026 in ALL aspects of our life. We make PROCLAMATIONS about what we are! I am a stay at home mom, and that\u2019s my identity\u2026I am a Libertarian\u2026I am a Mormon and that\u2019s that\u2026what we\u2019re desperately trying to do is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence.\n\nAll of these things are just us wanting to think about our \u201cselves\u201d as some static thing set in stone\u2026 and run from the reality of the possibilities we have. When we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal, it terrifies us and produces a feeling called nausea\u2026and we use Bad Faith to quell this feeling of nausea. Now if all you ever read was Sartre\u2019s Being and Nothingness\u2026you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith, is an inescapable condition of being a human being\u2026 and that even when we\u2019re self aware of the Bad Faith we\u2019re engaging in\u2026we\u2019re still engaging in bad faith. If all you ever read was the main text of Being and Nothingness, you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture\u2026but in one of the footnotes of Being and Nothingness Sartre alludes to a way out and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later in life. Well HE never writes an ethics, and it may be because he lifelong partner and fellow existentialist Simone De Beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called The Ethics of Ambiguity. We\u2019ll talk all about it on the next episode.\n\nBut enough of bad faith\u2026back to answering this question: who am I, really?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. These concepts of Facticity and Transcendence we\u2019ve been talking about. When it comes to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have\u2026those things aren\u2019t hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to. You may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you\u2026 and the possibilities that you have, but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them, Sartre would say: you don\u2019t have some privileged VIP access to the facts about you and the possibilities that you have\u2026hypothetically, any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your Facticity and Transcendence. In fact, just like the guy that tells himself that he\u2019s Napoleon\u2026 sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than WE are.\n\nBut how is this possible? The reason it\u2019s possible is because the self is not the Christian soul, to Sartre.\n\nJust like your Facticity and Transcendence\u2026what we\u2019re referencing when we talk about our \u201cselves\u201d\u2026 is outside of us. It\u2019s an abstraction. It\u2019s the conglomeration of all of the things you\u2019ve ever actually done in your life. When you want to get a solid answer to the question: who am I? You don\u2019t reference the story that you tell yourself that\u2019s clouded by all sorts of\u2026 bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at Walmart\u2026no, we tell ourselves stories all the time\u2026 what follows from this is that the TRUE measure of your values, and who you really are\u2026is what you actually do\u2026it\u2019s the collection of what you\u2019ve actually done thus far in your life. And Sartre says when you stop looking at the \u201cself\u201d as though it\u2019s something inside of you\u2026and you start looking at it accurately as this abstraction that\u2019s outside of us\u2026what you inevitably start to realize is that it\u2019s impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are, without referencing the way that other people view you. More than that\u2026it\u2019s impossible to get a full picture of BEING without referencing other people\u2026and HERE\u2019S what he\u2019s getting at:\n\nSo far when it comes to describing being\u2026 we\u2019ve been presented with being in itself and being for itself\u2026 but it\u2019s right here, FAIRLY LATE in being and nothingness\u2026 that Sartre lays out his third ontological category\u2026what he calls \u201cbeing-for-others\u201d. Let\u2019s talk about what he means. Sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you\u2026 is existing alongside other people and all of the consequences that come along with that. This is Being-for-others\u2026now how does \u201cbeing-for-others\u201d affect my answer to the question: who am I?\n\nWell again, this concept of the self is outside of us it\u2019s an abstractrion\u2026 and what Sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people. For example, whether we\u2019re trustworthy or not. Whether or not you\u2019re a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that\u2019s mediated by other people, right? Whether I\u2019m a nice or mean person. I may think of myself as a nice person, but if every single other person I encounter all throughout my life says that I\u2019m mean, for all intents and purposes\u2026I am a mean person.\n\nThis concept of the self, and how other people view us\u2026seem to be connected, but the flip side of it being that interconnected\u2026is that it leaves us in a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us. We\u2019re almost constantly being turned into PURE facticity in their mind. For example, have you ever been walking around self-conscious about the way you look? Maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird\u2026and as you\u2019re walking around you feel like every person that passes you is thinking, WOW. What were THEY thinking when they picked those shoes. This is obviously a person that doesn\u2019t care much about how they look\u2026in other words they\u2019re looking at you and they\u2019re turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world\u2026pure facticity\u2026you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person\u2019s mind, this is constantly going on. But Sartre\u2019s not saying it\u2019s always bad, that being around other people is some sort of paranoid, everybody\u2019s thinking bad things about me all the time thing\u2026people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time, the point that Sartre wants to make is that this dynamic\u2026of other people seeing you, putting you on trial and turning you into pure Facticity in their minds\u2026 is going on all the time simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people\u2026and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable\u2026we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others.\n\nWhat I mean is: just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day doesn\u2019t mean that you are now \u201cweird shoes guy\u201d. In other words, don\u2019t slip into bad faith when it comes to what people think about you\u2026no matter how convenient it is to prescribe yourself an essence and deny your transcendence\u2026don\u2019t turn yourself into PURE facticity and accept what other people tell you you are. Maybe you are weird shoes guy right now, but you don\u2019t HAVE to be in the future. But the other side of that, is don\u2019t deny your facticity and tell yourself that you don\u2019t care what anyone else says and that what other people think of you doesn\u2019t matter at all. That\u2019s slipping into another kind of bad faith.\n\nSo to sum this up\u2026intuitively, it may seem to us like we have a special access to knowing who we are\u2026 and that we choose to share ourselves only with our closest friends who we trust. But Sartre would say the reason it seems this way is that what you actually have is a narrative about yourself, forged from a particular biased perspective, and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are\u2026is because the very criteria that we all use to choose who our friends are going to be\u2026is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves.\n\nThat\u2019s what we \u201clike\u201d about our friends, to Sartre. For example, if a BIG part of the way you view your self\u2026 is that you consider yourself a smart person\u2026Sartre would predict\u2026 that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you that you\u2019re smart all the time, or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer, making you FEEL smart, or other smart people that commend you on being so smart like them. We choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves, of COURSE we we\u2019d give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves, and of course it\u2019s going to feel validating.\n\nOf course it would seem\u2026that you know better than anyone who you are\u2026but again, Sartre would say that the TRUE measure of your values, the TRUE answer to the question: who are you?\u2026is what you actually do. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_80": {"date": "2017-7-19", "text": "Posted on July 19, 2017\nEpisode 106 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #106\u00a0on Simone De Beauvoir. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo last episode we talked about Sartre\u2019s idea that at the foundation of who we are\u2026 there\u2019s a constant tug of war that\u2019s going on between what he calls our Facticity and our Transcendence. Our Facticity being the facts that are true about us at any given moment and our Transcendence being the possibilities that we have at our disposal. Last episode, what followed from this, for Sartre\u2026is that people are made massively uncomfortable by this constant tug of war that\u2019s going on\u2026 and we all tend to gravitate towards removing one side of the people pulling on the rope\u2026 we either want to ignore the facts that are true about us or ignore the possibilities that we have so that one side will just fall into the mud pit already and we can all stop pulling on this stupid rope.\nBut unfortunately\u2026 Sartre would say\u2026 the game never actually ends. Despite the fact you may view yourself as some sort of completed project\u2026the reality is that through your actions\u2026 you are constantly creating and re-creating yourself in each passing moment\u2026.every second, that passes you change in some small way\u2026the reality is: we all exist in this place of tension\u2026this tug of war that\u2019s going on between two sides of a duality called our Facticity and Transcendence.\nBut Simone De Beauvoir is going to take that one step further. The implications of which form the basis of her book The Ethics of Ambiguity. Just listen for second to the very first paragraph of the book and then we\u2019ll talk about what she\u2019s getting at:\n\u201cTHE continuous work of our life,\u201d says Montaigne, \u201cis to build death.\u201d Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. \u201cRational animal,\u201d \u201cthinking reed,\u201d he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.\u201d\nNow you can just hear in that passage\u2026 she\u2019s describing what she\u2019s later going to go on to call the Ambiguity of human existence. Let\u2019s talk about what she means by that. She\u2019d say sure, Sartre at any given moment we are both Facticity and Transcendence\u2026it\u2019s a duality we exist within\u2026like we talked about last episode, when you take an honest look at what it is to be me\u2026I am what I am\u2026but simultaneously I also am what I am not yet. And if somebody asked you\u2026so\u2026 which one are you really are you the facts about who you are right now, or are you the possibilities you\u2019re currently bringing about? That\u2019d be kind of a confusing question because the answer is: I\u2019m BOTH. Yes, people commonly fall into bad faith and try to remove one side of it\u2026but the reality is I am BOTH Facticity and Transcendence simultaneously and that reality creates a certain tension for me.\n\nBut Simone De Beauvoir would point out\u2026that when you take a closer look at human existence\u2026it starts to look like we\u2019re not just engaged in a single game of tug of war that\u2019s going on\u2026it\u2019s not just Facticity and Transcendence\u2026we seem to be engaged\u2026 in MANY different games of tug of war all at the same time.\nSee because yes, I am both Facticity and Transcendence. But what else am I? Lots of things she would say. For example\u2026 at any given moment, I am simultaneously both a subject navigating the world and an object within other people\u2019s subjective view of the world. So what am I? Am I a subject or an object? What if I\u2019m both of them simultaneously and that existing within that duality creates a certain level of tension for me? Another example\u2026at any given moment, I am both an individual person and a member of a collective group, family, nation-state, species, whatever. So what am I? Am I an individual or a part of a larger group? What if I\u2019m both simultaneously and that existing within that duality creates a certain level of tension for me? Mind and matter. Self and other. The examples of these dualities that we exist between go on over the horizon\u2026and Simone De Beauvoir would say that when you look back at the history of philosophy and religion\u2026so many of the ideas that have been laid out over the years have been people trying to reduce one side of these dualities\u2026 so that we can simplify the world down into terms that are less ambiguous. To escape the true reality of the Ambiguity of being a human in this world. Whether it was to think of the world as merely an earthly shadow of flawed forms\u2026whether it was to think of ourselves as a mind perched up within a brain, or a soul inhabiting a body\u2026or as a member of a state with a duty to fulfill that transcends your individual desires\u2026within each and every one of these and many more\u2026 you can see what Simone De Beauvoir says is an attempt to over-simplify our human condition, and escape the true Ambiguity of existence. The ethics of Ambiguity is just filled with iconic quotes that are unforgettable\u2026about this point she says: `\n\u201cAt the present time there still exist many doctrines which choose to leave in the shadow certain troubling aspects of a too complex situation. But their attempt to lie to us is in vain. Cowardice does not pay. Those reasonable metaphysics, those consoling ethics with which they would like to entice us only accentuate the disorder from which we suffer.\u201d\nJust listen to that quote\u2026those REASONABLE metaphysics, those CONSOLING ethics with which they would like to entice us\u2026that is just great writing. And shots fired at Philosophers and Theologians throughout history\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying they start to look guilty of what your average person does when they fall into Bad Faith\u2026how is what they\u2019re doing any different than reducing one side of your Facticity and Transcendence to try to escape a state of tension.\nNo\u2026to be an honest human being\u2026is to be in a state of tension\u2026it\u2019s to BE in a state of ambiguity. Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying\u2026we feel the effects of this ambiguity\u2026and our kneejerk response throughout history has been to feel like something\u2019s missing\u2026she says we recognize a \u201clack\u201d in ourselves (important word)\u2026we feel like somethings missing and that if only we can come up with the right philosophical rationalization to make us feel like we understand the world perfectly\u2026then the ambiguity\u2019s gonna go away\u2026then we\u2019re going to be COMPLETE as people.\nWhat Simone De Beauvoir is asking here is what if we\u2019re never meant to be completed as people? And that no matter what story you decide tell yourself to run from the ambiguity\u2026what if it\u2019s just not as simple as I am purely a spirit\u2026or I\u2019m PURE energy\u2026or PURELY an American\u2026what if the world, what if being a human being is not black and white like that\u2026what if it\u2019s black, white and grey simultaneously and that we purposefully look at it through a very small lens to make us feel like its more simple than it really is? What would happen\u2026 if somebody stopped running from this Ambiguity and just embraced it, what would that person look like? Could you ever be happy living within that ambiguity? Is there any reasonable foundation that you can approach how to best behave within that ambiguity? This is the task of the ethics of ambiguity.\nNow if you\u2019re gonna be an existentialist writing an approach to ethics like Simone De Beauvoir is\u2026there\u2019re going to be certain classic questions that arise that you\u2019ll have to address at some point. One of them is that\u2026. if existence precedes essence\u2026if it is the job of the individual to create their own values and meaning to life\u2026how can anyone ever say that the values I arrive at are any less or more valid than anyone else\u2019s. What I mean is, if someone arrived at a set of values that said raping and murdering people was a good thing\u2026if I\u2019m not appealing to some standard of good and evil behavior, if existence precedes essence\u2026how can I ever say that worldview is wrong?\nWell to begin answering this question\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s going to cite a famous line that Sartre writes in Being and Nothingness\u2026it\u2019s the idea that \u201cMan is condemned to be free.\u201d Where she\u2019s going with this is that\u2026even if there\u2019s no objective good and evil written into the universe\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not certain, fundamental aspects about the human condition that we have to consider when navigating our lives\u2026we are condemned to breath, we are condemned to forage for food, we are condemned to turn read receipts off on our cellphones\u2026but she\u2019d say more important than all of those things, we are condemned to be free\u2026we are condemned without our prior consent, to a life where we have to be constantly making choices\u2026she points out how\u2026even if you try to deny this reality\u2026 even if you just sit around or fall into bad faith and do nothing your whole life\u2026the choice to do nothing\u2026 is still a choice you\u2019re making, The fact that we\u2019re condemned to freedom\u2026the fact that we can make practically any choice we want is the very thing that allows us to create the meaning to our lives\u2026in other words\u2026this essence we\u2019re talking about ultimately relies on this more fundamental aspect of the human condition that we are free\u2026and if you examine this freedom closely, she thinks there are certain essences (like raping and murdering people) that are just flat out contradictory to arrive at.\nSee because, the very idea of morality relies on the idea that people are free enough to choose between at least two different alternatives. Right, I mean if somebody was truly powerless over acting in a particular way, the whole concept of morality evaporates. For example if you were down at the beach and you lost control of your skateboard\u2026and it was rolling towards the edge of the boardwalk about to go into the ocean\u2026and your friend was near the edge and could easily put their foot out and stop the skateboard, but let\u2019s say they don\u2019t\u2026let\u2019s say they look at you\u2026look at the skateboard\u2026hands on their knees smiling as they stare at the skateboard plummeting into the ocean\u2026you might call their behavior into question.\nNow same situation, but this time you lost control of your 18-wheeler semi-truck\u2026you\u2019re probably not gonna wonder why they didn\u2019t dive in front of it like they\u2019re superman\u2026they were powerless, there was nothing they could do about it in that situation. This is an example of how the whole idea\u2026 of what we\u2019re morally obligated to do\u2026 is directly connected to the amount of freedom we have in a given situation\u2026or as Simone De Beauvoir puts it you don\u2019t offer an ethics to a God\u2026you don\u2019t offer ethics to someone who thinks they can\u2019t make mistakes or on the other hand to anyone who thinks they\u2019re powerless to the point they can\u2019t make choices. Good news for us is: in actuality we\u2019re neither of these things, people just tell themselves they are\u2026and because this whole discussion of ethics and what we\u2019re morally accountable for\u2026 is ultimately contingent upon our level of freedom\u2026it follows to Simone De Beauvoir\u2026that any serious discussion about what we\u2019re morally accountable to do at the VERY least\u2026 needs to begin from a place that maximizes that default state that we\u2019re born into: condemned to be free.\nIn other words: in the same way we shouldn\u2019t deny one side of these dualities we exist between in an attempt to run from the ambiguity of existence\u2026we shouldn\u2019t deny that we are condemned to be free. We should recognize the fundamental aspect of our being THAT we are free, embrace it and then move in the direction of behaviors that MAXIMIZE that freedom rather than run from it. Now the extension of this\u2026and one of the highly unique aspects of her Ethics we\u2019re gonna talk a lot more about next episode\u2026is that to TRULY maximize your freedom to Simone De Beauvoir requires the maximization of the freedom of others\u2026that for many reasons, you can\u2019t really be totally free unless if other people around you are totally free.\nAgain, we\u2019re gonna talk all about it next episode because that\u2019s the third and final part of the Ethics of Ambiguity\u2026 and what we\u2019ve been talking about so far is what she lays out in part one. So what does that leave us with? Part two\u2026I guess I just want to talk for a second about how this book is structured\u2026it\u2019s pretty brilliant what she does and I didn\u2019t really realize what exactly she was doing when I first read it years ago. So, part one lays out this whole idea of the Ambiguity of existence and the maximization of freedom\u2026part three lays out how we should actually be behaving in practice, and part two can read like a sort of a tangential aside where she wants to put certain people on blast for not being free enough\u2026but the genius of what she\u2019s doing in part two is that she foresees the people coming along reading her work mistakenly thinking they have it all figured out\u2026she foresees people saying stuff like, ambiguity? Oh yeah\u2026WAY ahead of you Ms. De Beauvoir, way ahead of you\u2026LONG AGO I accepted the true ambiguity of existence and even LONGER BEFORE THAT when I was but a child I realized how free I am to choose anything I want. Sometimes it gets lonely\u2026you know \u2026being so smart\u2026being so much more free than everyone else around me\u2026but it\u2019s not all bad I find humor in their feeble attempts to deny their freedom\u2026\nThis is what\u2019s so awesome about part two\u2026Simone De Beauvoir lays out like 12 different personality types of people that she sees around her\u2026personalities that you still see EVERYWHERE in today\u2019s world\u2026some very simple, some very nuanced, but ALL OF WHICH are examples of tactics people use to convince themselves they are free when they actually could be much more free\u2026not only that though\u2026when you look at these types of people that she talks about\u2026 Simone De Beauvoir thinks all of these different approaches to looking at life\u2026 are reactions to when we were children\u2026they\u2019re reaction to when we were first faced with the reality, the true freedom and responsibility that\u2019s required of us, in adulthood.\nShe says two things happen when we\u2019re kids: one, we\u2019re born\u2026and we look at adults as these authoritative sources of information\u2026 people that have grasped the ultimate values of life and we need to be more like them. We seem them as these\u2026COMPLETED people\u2026these people that have figured out what\u2019s lacking like we talked about before and have COMPLETED themselves. But again, what if in reality\u2026we NEVER complete ourselves. What are THEY doing then?\nThe second thing that happens is that throughout the entire time you\u2019re a kid, you live in a state\u2026 of never having to deal with the ambiguity of existence\u2026your parents\u2026protect you from that and what you end up doing is running around, playing and just being a kid. In other words, what Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying is that for the first 16 years of your life or so\u2026you don\u2019t even KNOW about the ambiguity of existence\u2026you don\u2019t even know about this constant state of tension that life truly is. You know, there\u2019s people that have emailed me and asked why do you think we have such a tendency to gravitate towards bad faith, as opposed to embracing our freedom? Well, how can you blame people? You\u2019re faced the reality of the freedom and responsibility of adulthood\u2026and when you look around you at the role models you have at your disposal\u2026they\u2019re all people that claim to have this whole life thing figured out. They\u2019re all people using one of these strategies she talks about, convincing themselves that they\u2019ve COMPLETED themselves.\nKind of like Nietzsche and the whole Camel, Lion and Child progression he lays out in Thus Spoke Zarathustra\u2026Simone De Beauvoir structures all these different types of people in part two in a similar sort of way where there\u2019s a progression\u2026a progression from the least free to the most free. Now, the LEAST free person\u2026the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of freedom\u2026is what Simone De Beauvoir calls the \u201csub-man\u201d. The sub-man is that guy working at Subway making sandwiches all day\u2026what a loser says Simone De Beauvoir\u2026just kidding she\u2019s talking about a different kind of sub\u2026sub meaning below.\nSimone De Beauvoir describes this person as the kind of person who\u2019s sort of apathetic about everything all the time. She says they feel \u201c like nothing merits desire or effort\u201d. That everything\u2019s dull\u2026nothing is really that impressive ever\u2026they see things other people do\u2026they shrug a lot\u2026meh\u2026okay. Nothing really is worth their time.\nSimone De Beauvoir says that what this is\u2026 is a child that saw just how much freedom adulthood had in store for them\u2026they saw the sheer number of possible projects they could work on throughout their life\u2026they felt really uncomfortable\u2026 and then in an attempt to ease their discomfort and return to that\u2026safe, unambiguous cocoon of childhood\u2026they sort of retreated and closed themselves off from the world.\nPeople with a lot of different interests and a lot of capability are at a higher risk for becoming a sub-man\u2026reason being because they look at all the possibilities and say man I could do anything\u2026I could be a Veterinarian, I could be a news anchor, I could be a scientist\u2026you know what\u2026who cares about any of it? They deny that there\u2019s any sort of tension or lack within themselves that requires action\u2026 and they COMPLETE themselves\u2026 by choosing, nothing\u2026De Beauvoir says\u2026and the problem with someone choosing nothing on a social level\u2026 is that they become potential members of a mob. They become malleable fodder for the projects that other people are working on\u2026 as long as those people can persuade the sub-men to be temporarily emboldened by whatever cause they give them to support. Sub-man\u2019s often referred to as what people call a \u201csheep\u201d.\nThe second rung on this ladder of types of people\u2026little more free than the Sub-man, but still deeply enslaved and running from the ambiguity of existence\u2026 is what she calls the Serious-man. The serious-man makes up probably around\u2026 70% of people\u2026this is by far the most common tactic people use to remove themselves from ambiguity. The Serious man is any version of somebody that denies their transcendence and turns themselves into pure facticity for the sake of a cause. This is the child facing the freedom of adulthood\u2026 all grown up now saying something like: I am a life long democrat and I\u2019m always going to be a democrat. I\u2019ve harnessed the ultimate values of life and completed myself like my parents did. I am an evangelical Christian and I will be that way until the day I die. I have discovered a set of absolute values.\nMake no mistake\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s not saying that being any of these things is wrong\u2026it\u2019s your relationship to how you view the title. Do you live your life as though being a democrat or being a Christian is some sort of permanent, irreversible aspect about who you are? If so, then Simone De Beauvoir would say you are a Serious man, trying to give yourself an essence and escape the true ambiguity of your life\u2026and if you look back at history even just to the 20th century\u2026you don\u2019t gotta look very long to see the bloodshed that often comes when people think they\u2019ve harnessed an ultimate set of values\u2026 that\u2019s what Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s worried about.\nNow another important rung on this ladder a little higher up\u2026is a response to the freedom of adulthood\u2026that\u2019s a true classic. We\u2019ve all heard of this one before. I\u2019m talking about Nihilism.\nQuick recap of the ladder up until this point: The sub man either doesn\u2019t realize there\u2019s a lack in their being\u2026 or denies the whole idea of there being something lacking\u2026the serious man acknowledges that there\u2019s a lack\u2026 and then believes a story about something that will complete him as a person. And, the nihilist\u2026 realizes there\u2019s a lack and that nothing can complete them\u2026so they ask themselves question, why bother doing anything at all?\nNow Nihilism is a particularly dangerous place to be if you\u2019re Simone De Beauvoir\u2026and the reason why is because the Nihilist\u2026is partially right. They\u2019ve arrived at the truth about the ambiguity of existence\u2026but they\u2019re making a big assumption after arriving at that conclusion that blinds them from the fact that they aren\u2019t seeing the WHOLE truth about existence\u2026and it\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s a very easy trap to fall into and then convince yourself that you\u2019re right, citing that piece of truth you\u2019ve accessed as justification.\nI want to read you a passage out of the ethics of ambiguity where Simone De Beauvoir talks about why the Nihilist is wrong. Full disclosure, I have this passage hanging in the front room of my house\u2026it\u2019s one of my favorite passages from all of existentialism. We\u2019ll read it and then we\u2019ll talk about what she means by it:\n\u201cThe nihilist attitude manifests a certain truth. In this attitude one experiences the ambiguity of the human condition. But the mistake is that it defines man not as the positive existence of a lack, but as a lack at the heart of existence, whereas the truth is that existence is not a lack as such. And if freedom is experienced in this case in the form of rejection, it is not genuinely fulfilled. The nihilist is right in thinking that the world possesses no justification and that he himself is nothing. But he forgets that it is up to him to justify the world and to make himself exist validly. Instead of integrating death into life, he sees in it the only truth of the life, which appears to him as a disguised death. However, there is life, and the nihilist knows that he is alive. That\u2019s where his failure lies. He rejects existence without managing to eliminate it. He denies any meaning to his transcendence, and yet he transcends himself. A man who delights in freedom can find an ally in the nihilist because they contest the serious world together, but he also sees in him an enemy insofar as the nihilist is a systematic rejection of the world and man, and if this rejection ends up in a positive desire destruction, it then establishes a tyranny which freedom must stand up against.\u201d\nI guess a good place to start unpacking that is to say that if it weren\u2019t for the Nihilist being partially right\u2026and recognizing the true ambiguity of things\u2026they would be no different than the serious man. Because just like the serious man\u2026 who might say something like, ok I am a Morman\u2026and I possess certain ultimate values that are written into the cosmos, I am complete\u2026a Nihilist is making the same kind of proclamation by saying \u201cthere is no cosmically written meaning to my life\u201d, I am complete. In other words, why are we both speaking on behalf of the universe here? I mean at least the Mormon believes in a God that gave them this information\u2026what is the Nihilists based on? The way it intuitively seems to me as a human being in an ambiguous world?\nI\u2019m not saying this because there IS some cosmically written meaning necessarily\u2026the point is: where did this expectation of the Nihilist come from? Lot of people think it\u2019s an another one of those things we talked about last time\u2026it\u2019s an extension of generation after generation of people thinking of themselves as something born into a realm\u2026that doesn\u2019t belong to them. This universe is private property\u2026God built this place\u2026he\u2019s bestowed upon you the gift of life\u2026 and as long as you\u2019re staying here\u2026there\u2019s some chores he wants you to do. When the Nihilist realizes this way of thinking is a relic of a bygone era\u2026they mistakenly assume that because there\u2019s no God out there to confer a meaning onto them\u2026that therefore\u2026there must be no meaning to ANYTHING that I do!\nBut what if that whole dream of being handed some pre-packaged meaning to your life was never how it worked at all? What if that was an assumption? What is meaning anyway\u2026it\u2019s just a human construct\u2026a word. What if the same way you have to choose a career\u2026and the same way you have to choose a life partner\u2026and these things take years of thought to fully realize\u2026what if it\u2019s your responsibility to choose a meaning to your life?\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: what if there IS a meaning to your life? And I\u2019m not saying that like I\u2019m some late night pastor\u2026what Simone De Beauvoir would ask is what if when you make a grandiose proclamation like \u201cthere is no meaning to my life\u201d\u2026you just did it\u2026right there\u2026you just declared the meaning of your life to be that you\u2019re going to sit around making proclamations about how nothing matters on a cosmic level (genius) and then use it as justification never take action on anything. You can\u2019t HELP but have a meaning to your life to Simone De Beauvoir\u2026it is created and recreated by your actions in each passing moment.\nThe question is: what\u2019s the meaning of your life gonna be? To sit around on the couch doing nothing? Or to transcend. To get out of that job that sucks the life out of you\u2026or to travel the world or to help maximize the freedom of others? To leave the house\u2026feel the fires of hell on your skin as sunlight hits it for the first time in eight months? What is the meaning gonna be?\nNext time we\u2019ll talk more about more of the rungs of the ladder, more of these= types of ways children respond to the startling level of freedom and responsibility required in adulthood\u2026 as well as the importance of maximizing the freedom of others, why we can never be truly free unless if others are free around us and the wisdom that lies in living a life in the service of others. You know whenever I read part three of the Ethics of Ambiguity and I get all excited about the importance of finding a way to serve others in this miserable existence it always brings me back to ironically ANOTHER quote that I have on my wall by Rabandranath Tagore\u2026and I\u2019ll leave you today with it:\nI slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_81": {"date": "2017-8-17", "text": "Posted on August 17, 2017\nEpisode 108 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #108\u00a0on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to be talking about individual philosophers on most shows, but let\u2019s never forget the fact that our ultimate goal throughout this current arc of the show is to tell some of the MAIN philosophical stories of the twentieth century. And realistically, you could never tell the FULL story on a show like this.\nBut the point is we\u2019re talking about more than just individuals now\u2026we\u2019re talking about movements, we\u2019re talking about massive historical events that thinkers are living within and reacting to\u2026we\u2019re telling a STORY, here. And whenever you\u2019re telling a story\u2026sometimes you need a narrator that takes a step back from the individual characters and what they\u2019re saying\u2026 and talks about what\u2019s going on on a larger scale so that you can understand the behavior of the characters better.\nWhy is it\u2026that freedom and responsibility are so important to Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir, specifically in the time they\u2019re living, what were they responding to? Why is Bertrand Russell so concerned with mathematics\u2026why is Wittgenstein SO concerned with language\u2026specifically\u2026during the time he was living in the early 20th century?\nWe have a lot of people to talk about. But one thing I think you\u2019ll find the further we get along this journey\u2026is just how revolutionary of a moment it was in modern human history\u2026 when Nietzsche wrote the words: God is dead. Seriously, if there was a page one of this story that we\u2019re telling\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be once upon a time in that giant Declaration of Independence font\u2026it would be God is dead. He remains dead, and we have killed him.\nNow when Nietzsche says this\u2026a way someone might misinterpret Nietzsche here is to think oh, he said God is dead\u2026here\u2019s this anti-religious nihilist philosopher triumphantly proclaiming that God is dead calling for us to move onward into a better age where we can get away from the scourge of religion! Not even close to who Nietzsche was or what he was saying\u2026and I think it\u2019s going to be useful for us to talk a little more about what he WAS saying\u2026 at least more than we did in Nietzsche pt. 1\u2026real quick, just to get back to where we were in that episode:\nThink of any universal human problem. Think of a problem where no matter what area of the world your particular ancestors decided to settle\u2026they were going to be faced with this problem and were going to be forced to come up with some creative invention that DEALS with this problem. Carrying a lot of heavy stuff around. No matter where you\u2019re from\u2026your ancestors had to invent something to cope with carrying around heavy stuff. And historically, what we see, are different cultures coming up with slightly different solutions to this problem based on a lot of different factors individual to them\u2026what resources they had, what landmarks were around them, what their lives were like\u2026for example if you were a culture of animal husbandry\u2026some sort of herding culture\u2026maybe you used animals to solve this problem of carrying around heavy stuff. If you were part of a culture that had a lot of trees around you\u2026 maybe you rolled things around on logs\u2026maybe you make a cart or a wagon or a rickshaw, any one of these inventions that ALL are slightly different from each other\u2026 but ultimately were all created by human beings with the same goal in mind: to solve this universal human problem of carrying heavy stuff.\nWell what\u2019s another universal human problem? What\u2019s a question that every human being asks at some point in their life? What is the meaning of my life? How do I fit into the grand picture of the universe? How can I feel like my life has meaning? In other words, in the same way cultures throughout history have all come up with their own personalized, slightly different, clever inventions that solve the problem of carrying around heavy stuff\u2026Nietzsche would say that all the varying forms of mythology and religion throughout history, have been the same thing: clever human inventions to solve a universal human problem of answering these existential questions.\nNow fast forward to Nietzsche saying God is Dead. Nietzsche himself is not really doing anything when he just says the words God is Dead\u2026the significance of those words\u2026 lies in him pointing out a reality of the world that\u2019s come to pass.\nHe\u2019s pointing out\u2026 that our understanding of the world has come a long way since the scientific revolution. That science has no doubt given us a lot of incredible things\u2026but we have to start to think about, at what cost has that come? Nietzsche would say that being a human being in this new scientific world we have\u2026is just a totally different situation than any other situation a human has had to face before\u2026that for us\u2026living in a world post-Copernicus, post-Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Freud\u2026living in that world as a human being\u2026it has become next to impossible to simultaneously be both a reasonable person\u2026while also believing that there\u2019s a guy up in the clouds named Zeus with lightning bolts that\u2019s going to zap you if you do something wrong\u2026or that there\u2019s a guy that used to walk on water and cure blind people. In other words, it\u2019s become next to impossible to use one of these clever human inventions\u2026 that solve this universal human problem of searching for meaning.\nWhen Nietzsche says God is dead. He\u2019s not saying that in a happy tone, at all. He\u2019s saying it regretfully\u2026FEARFULLY even. Think about the situation we\u2019re in as people: we are TRIBAL creatures. We have such a strong tendency to attach ourselves to some group or some cause\u2026and then the meaning of our life becomes to advance the agenda of OUR group, label some other group as the enemy, and then go to war with that other group. Think of all the OTHER incentives we have to act this way\u2026how good it feels to seemingly have a vice-grip on the way that things are in the world, no further questions, no more cognitive dissonance for me. How good it feels\u2026to derive a sense of identity from these beliefs that you hold\u2026to escape that ambiguity about who you are. Given the reality of human psychology\u2026think of how many barriers are naturally in the way if you want to try to budge somebody OFF of one of these positions\u2026and for tens of thousands of years whenever people have asked what tribe they should be a part of, what their sense of identity should be or where they can get a convenient vice-grip on the truth\u2026for tens of thousands of years mythology and religion has given them those answers.\nYou know, Nietzsche would say that the sort of na\u00efve way of looking at religion is to say, hey\u2026look back at history! Look at all the wars that have been carried out in the name of religion. In the name of these fairy tales people used to believe in\u2026you know what? We need to do away with all this religion nonsense and get rid of this unnecessary bloodshed. Nietzsche would say, ok\u2026let\u2019s do away with religion and start over. Do you think the history of the world is going to be a bunch of science fairs and meditation seminars? No\u2026it would still be a violent and bloody clash\u2026 of people organizing into groups, thinking in terms of us vs. them, exercising their will to power\u2026it just wouldn\u2019t be religious groups carrying it out. In fact there\u2019s people that make the case that religion may have been a moderating influence on the violence throughout history\u2026because at least it allowed people to organize into these MASSIVE groups of millions people\u2026as opposed to the world being much more fragmented and volatile.\nWhen Nietzsche says God is dead he\u2019s not talking about the literal death of some deity. He\u2019s talking about the death of humanity\u2019s pursuit for moral objectivity. He\u2019s talking about the death\u2026of people having a ready-made answer that fills that void within them that craves meaning. Nietzsche\u2019s asking: what are people going to do now that they don\u2019t have that answer? Remember, to Nietzsche, 95% of people are the mob\u2026they\u2019re camels, beasts of burden, all of their beliefs and values loaded onto their backs by other people\u2026they\u2019re scared and lazy and generally speaking are just not the kind of people that are going to read up on some existentialism and fill this void in other ways. And it\u2019s not like when you cut the legs out from underneath religion science just naturally fills that void\u2026.people aren\u2019t sitting around saying, well there\u2019s no meaning to anything I do\u2026but I got a large Hadron collider for Christmas\u2026that\u2019ll be fun. Just got a new iPhone\u2026spiritual guidance\u2026I think I\u2019m good for a while! No that void doesn\u2019t just magically disappear\u2026and they\u2019re GOING to fill it with something\u2026the question becomes: now that it\u2019s a near impossibility to fill it with religion\u2026 what are people going to fill it with?\nNietzsche predicts in his book The Will to Power\u2026very ominously\u2026that in the next 100 years after writing that book\u2026tens of millions of people are going to die because of the position we\u2019ve worked ourselves into. Nietzsche saw the beginning of the twentieth century before it even happened. In many ways, he saw the world we still live in today before it even happened. Out went religion and in came ideology. Nationalism\u2026Marxism\u2026Capitalism\u2026tons of other isms you could throw in there. The story of the 20th century is in large part a story of competing ideologies living in the wake of the death of God.\nWhen the French Existentialists\u2026Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Camus\u2026are writing their work\u2026part of the reason why they\u2019re so focused on making a case for individuality\u2026 is because they\u2019re living in the middle of Nazi occupied France. They\u2019re living in a world where people are thinking of themselves first, and primarily as a member of some group\u2026 and THEN as an individual human being.\nI am a German. Germany is one of the great nations of the world. If we\u2019re ever going to assume our rightful place as a world power we\u2019re going to have to take back some of the land THEY took from US through the treaty of Versailles. Us vs. Them. People identifying themselves in terms of their GROUP identity rather than their individuality. The reason freedom and responsibility is so important to the French Existentialists\u2026is because people were using this group identity, as a justification for doing horrible things\u2026 and then pretending they had no choice in the matter because this is what their group is doing.\nFor example, look\u2026I\u2019m a just Nazi Soldier\u2026if one of the higher ups orders me to go round up those kids over there and put a bullet in their head\u2026I\u2019m just a soldier following orders. I had no choice in the matter. Or on the other side\u2026hey, I\u2019m just a citizen of France I didn\u2019t want to go to war. Those Nazi people have guns\u2026what can I do but just sit around weave flowers together so I can throw them on whoever comes and saves me? I don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\nThe existentialists are responding to this thinking by saying, no\u2026in both cases, you didn\u2019t need to kill those kids and you could\u2019ve been actively part of the resistance\u2026in other words: you DID have a choice, and you are responsible for what you have done. The consequences for making that different choice may have been dire for you, but one thing the existentialists aren\u2019t going to allow\u2026 is to let you get away with pretending to be some droning, mindless member of a group that\u2019s devoid of individual autonomy. But, on the other hand\u2026again, an integral part of being a human being is FEELING like you\u2019re a member of some group that is fighting for good. That\u2019s the sort of ambiguity that we have to navigate as people in this new post-scientific revolution world. And if you\u2019re not an EXTREMELY self-aware and HONEST person\u2026as Simone De Beauvoir warns about\u2026you can very easily find yourself a foot soldier for some tyrannical group\u2026all the while feeling TOTALLY morally justified\u2026feeling like you\u2019re a good person while doing it. As people that are alive today\u2026JUST like the people of Germany in the 1930\u2019s\u2026we all carry this burden of potentially reducing ourselves to just a foot soldier of an ideological group, but we CAN\u2019T forget our individuality.\nNow one of the main ideologies that people attached themselves to and worked to advance throughout the 20th century\u2026 was neo-Marxism and its varying forms. In fact, at the same time Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir and Camus are doing their work in France\u2026there\u2019s a group of Marxists that had been working on their own projects since the 1920\u2019s that would come to be known as The Frankfurt School. Now this needs a bit of a setup\u2026to understand where the mindset of a western Marxist was during this time period\u2026 we have to talk about a couple prophesies that were made by Marx himself back in his time.\nRemember Hegel\u2019s Dialectic? The idea is that the process of change throughout history can be understood in terms of a repetition of three stages that Hegel calls the Thesis, the Antithesis and the Synthesis. There\u2019s a way that things are\u2026that\u2019s the Thesis\u2026some competing interest comes along and overthrows that way of doing things, but inevitably the pendulum swings too far in that other direction and eventually finds a resting point somewhere in the middle of the Thesis and Antithesis in a place Hegel calls the Synthesis. The Synthesis then becomes the new Thesis and so on and so forth throughout the history of time. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the concept and want more of an explanation, you can always go back and listen to the Hegel episodes.\nWell, as Marx famously writes, \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\u201d In other words, during his time Marx looks back at the history of the world and points out that when people go to war, or there\u2019s some sort of bloody revolution or civil war, people primarily tend to go to war for economic reasons. The history of the world to Marx seems to be, in a way that resembles Hegel\u2019s dialectic, a revolving door of a ruling class exerting control over an exploited class of people (the thesis), the exploited class of people rising up and overthrowing that ruling class (the antithesis), and then a new ruling class being elected that appears to be slightly better for the formerly exploited class (the synthesis). That new ruling class becomes the new thesis\u2026 and the whole process repeats itself over and over again. Marx points out how in every single economic system that\u2019s ever been implemented throughout history\u2026you always have this dynamic\u2026there always seems to be a ruling class and an exploited class. During the Feudal System there was the peasantry and the Aristocracy. In a slave based economy there are the slaves and the slave owners. To Karl Marx, capitalism is the same way. There are the people that control the resources and the means of production, and then there\u2019s the working class.\nDuring his time, Marx asks a question that would go on to change the course of human history. Why does it have to be this way? Does it? Do you think\u2026even potentially\u2026that there might be some sort of economic system we could put in place that doesn\u2019t have to involve this dialectic of class struggles? How many people need to die before we start to try to come up with some way that people don\u2019t need to be exploited\u2026 and there doesn\u2019t need to be this inevitable process of revolution and bloodshed?\nWell, after realizing this\u2026there\u2019s good news and bad news says Marx at this point. The bad news is people are currently being exploited\u2026right now\u2026but the good news is: we know exactly where this is going, because it\u2019s happened all throughout history. Here\u2019s the prophecy he makes: There\u2019s an industrial revolution going on in Europe at the time he\u2019s alive\u2026 and it\u2019s in these high production areas that the ruling vs exploited class dynamic of capitalism is going to be the most pronounced. Just like the peasants immiserated under the Feudal system, the working class in this capitalist system is eventually going to rise up, take over the means of production\u2026 and it\u2019s at that point that we should implement a system that DOESN\u2019T have this exploitation built into it.\nWell fast forward to Germany in the 1920\u2019s in what\u2019s known as the \u201cinterwar period\u201d, or the years in between the end of WW1 and the beginning of WW2. At this point in time there\u2019s a lot of Marxist thinkers sitting around waiting for this revolution to come about\u2026but strangely\u2026it hasn\u2019t happened yet. In fact, it seems like its not coming. There\u2019s an attempt immediately following the end of WW1 and all the turmoil that came with that\u2026but the Weimar Republic ends up winning and assuming control of Germany and a lot of thinkers were starting to doubt whether Marx was right with this whole grand prophecy of his.\nNot only that, they took look at the only country that\u2019s HAD a communist revolution at the time\u2026NOT an industrial society like Marx predicted but a predominantly AGRICULTURAL society at the time in Russia\u2026they see Marxism become this Leninist Authoritarianism that\u2019s going on there in the 1920\u2019s\u2026and what happens is this general attitude of skepticism towards Marx and his original theories\u2026 starts to creep in. Was Marx correct? Has this just been a massive failed experiment based on a misunderstanding of history?\nNow it should be said: there are people that just ignore everything that\u2019s going on and trudge forward with Marxism version 1.0\u2026there\u2019s other people that abandon Marxism thinking that it\u2019s failed. But there\u2019s a strong contingency of thinkers in the middle, The Frankfurt School among others\u2026thinkers in the middle that are still Marxists\u2026they still strongly believe in the world that Marxism is trying to bring about, but they\u2019re highly critical of Marx for a few different reasons. Many critiques but two of the major ones are that Marx doesn\u2019t talk enough about the concept of personal liberty within his system and he doesn\u2019t do enough to consider the individual. Remember, the thinkers of the Frankfurt School are living right around the same time as Husserl and Heidegger and Sartre\u2026 and all these other thinkers that, like we talked about, are highly skeptical of enlightenment style thinking\u2026of exalting reason onto this pedestal above everything else and trying to reduce everything, including human beings within a society down into these convenient, rational categories. During the time Karl Marx wrote his work, the concept of the individual just wasn\u2019t being considered in the same way it was during the time of the Frankfurt School, and the thinkers OF the Frankfurt School saw that as a huge blind spot within Marxism.\nJust to keep this organized: The Frankfurt School was a collection of neo-Marxists\u2026convinced that Marxism was still correct overall\u2026but that it needed some serious reworking\u2026especially if it was ever going to work where they eventually wanted to implement it\u2026 in western countries including but not limited to: the United States.\nNow, researchers in the Soviet Union compiled a collection of Marx\u2019s notes that was never before published called: economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844. Now, not only did this book provide a never before seen more Hegelian interpretation of Marx\u2026but this book was published in 1932\u2026perfect timing if you\u2019re someone who is a western Marxist and you want a fresh perspective on the whole situation. Couple this with the fact that basically every thinker in the first generation of the Frankfurt School was of Jewish descent\u2026living in Germany during the interwar years\u2026seeing the rising tide of anti-Semitism and Nazism all around them\u2026they saw the writing on the wall: first they moved the school out of Frankfurt to Geneva and then ultimately to New York City for several years where they embedded themselves into Columbia University.\nSo what were the goals of the Frankfurt School? Well, their short term goals were to take a deep look at enlightenment style thinking and try to figure out how it was possible\u2026for the world to go from a place technologically and culturally more advanced than it had ever been in history\u2026only to instantly devolve into the most barbaric, brutal, hateful event in human history\u2026 in WW2. The Frankfurt school wanted to understand\u2026how was that even possible? What it is about this post enlightenment world that makes that possible? The conclusions they arrive at range from interesting to downright scary. We\u2019ll talk about them in the upcoming episodes of the show.\nLater works of the Frankfurt School focus on a critique of Capitalism. Which naturally extends to a critique of the people they think are being exploited, Frankfurt School pointing at the invisible chains they say people unknowingly wear around each day and how they manifest into their lives. Which naturally extends to a critique of various traditions and institutions within those cultures.\nNow, some of these critiques are scathing to the point that they take things that are long standing institutions within western culture and they shine a light on them that makes people never see them in the same way again\u2026and when it comes to these critiques\u2026how people say you should interpret them and what the ultimate goals of the Frankfurt School were, is all over the map. Some people think this is just naturally what happens when Marxist thought clashes with Capitalist thought. That Capitalism, is an antiquated system\u2026founded on traditions that by their very nature are oppressive, don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny and that certain western traditions involving the church, lack of community, views on family among other things\u2026those traditions are what was necessary for the ruling vs exploited class dynamic to ever get off the ground in the first place. These people say this scathing critique is just Marxism holding a candle to weak traditions.\nThere are other people more in the middle that think both Marxism and Capitalism are viable systems if implemented correctly. That the critiques of the Frankfurt School, if they did anything, point out certain weak points that we, as a Capitalist society, should keep in mind moving forward when refining our systems and continuing to make things better.\nThere are other people that believe that the Frankfurt School is a group of Neo-Marxist thinkers engaged in a direct attack, the goal being to subvert western values, weaken the foundations of every aspect of western culture, then watch as the foundation eventually crumbles making it much easier to bring about a Marxist revolution in the west.\nPoint is: this conversation about how to interpret the critiques of the Frankfurt School can go on for days, and I\u2019m not interested in being the one that makes the final proclamation. So I\u2019ll leave you to make your own determination about what was going on inside the heads of the people that talk about these ideas, all I\u2019m interested in is the merit of the ideas and what\u2019s interesting about them.\nWhich brings me to a point I want to make. Just some things I want to put out there because I feel like they need to be said. I fully realize how political the world has become in the last year. I fully realize that there are podcasts and shows out there that used to do great content that now have become first and foremost a soapbox for some political ideology and secondarily content for their listeners. I just want to iterate that even though subject matters in the near future may trespass into places that are still relevant to modern politics\u2026this is not the show becoming some bullhorn for who the next president should be\u2026not that I even have strong enough political views to warrant doing a show on them\u2026and maybe that makes me the perfect person to do this series.\nLook, I come from poverty. I absolutely CHERISH being able to do this podcast for a living. The idea that I would dilute the show down and waste your time like that\u2026I mean if you knew me personally you\u2019d know that that\u2019s the furthest thing from who I am. I approach every episode of this show with the same question: how can I give the people listening to me the most value possible\u2026 in these 30 minutes of their time they\u2019ve given me? To me, it\u2019s an unselfish way of approaching the show that I think is a big reason why I\u2019ve been able to do this as long as I have. I respect your time\u2026and I guess I just want to plant a flag in the ground here and make a couple promises moving forward.\nI promise to cover these issues as fairly as I can. And I\u2019m not just talking about the typical binary left/right way of looking at things\u2026I plan on covering these subjects from multiple different angles that are interesting\u2026if I can\u2019t be comprehensive, I just won\u2019t cover it.\nSecondly, my hunch is that the majority of you listening, even if you\u2019re a hardcore capitalist or Marxist, my hunch is that you\u2019d welcome and be excited to hear a deep reading of the philosophy that underlies the other side respectively. They may ask questions you don\u2019t have answers to that you can look into\u2026at the very least you come out having strengthened your views from seeing the best the other side has to offer. But even if you\u2019re not that open minded and you\u2019ve already joined the tribe\u2026even if in this world where God is Dead you\u2019ve labeled one of those groups your mortal enemy that you have to fight against for the rest of your life\u2026I promise I\u2019m going to do these episodes in a way where you\u2019re still going to get something out of it.\nNow onto the question some of you are probably wondering: where\u2019s Camus? You said on Facebook Camus would be here, where is he?! Camus\u2019 coming, he\u2019s stuck in traffic he\u2019s going to be here soon. No, here\u2019s the thing about Camus. Throughout the next several episodes, we\u2019re not just going to be talking about Marxism and Capitalism from the perspective of the Frankfurt School\u2026we\u2019re going to be looking at it through the lens of thinkers that are critical of Marxism\u2026of which\u2026Camus is one of them and he\u2019s a particularly interesting one because he\u2019s a French Existentialist who\u2019s NOT a Marxist, unlike Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir\u2026AND he has a really interesting take on how Marxism starts to look like a direct mirror of Christianity\u2026you know with the dialectic as this absolute governing force moving us providentially into a particular direction\u2026the idea of this dialectic moving us toward some sort of ultimate end\u2026there being notable figures throughout its history that resemble saints and bishops\u2026heresy trials\u2026there are many parallels that we\u2019ll talk about more in depth when we get there.\nAnyway, to bring this full circle there are a couple ideas from Camus I want to expand on that I didn\u2019t get to finish in the last Camus episode because I was pressed for time. Nietzsche talks about this void that we have inside of us that craves meaning\u2026this void that\u2019s such a default, universal part of what it is to be a human being that some people aren\u2019t even aware that they have it\u2026they just fill it up with something immediately around them and then assume their role as a tribal zealot for the rest of their life. But what I love about Camus in the Myth of Sisyphus is that he talks about the process of discovering that void for the first time. When exactly do we realize there\u2019s something lacking in that department?\nRemember, Sisyphus is a man condemned by the Gods to an eternity of pushing a boulder up a hill, only to reach the top and watch as the boulder rolls back down to the bottom of the hill, at which point he walks back down to the bottom of the hill to start the process over again\u2026THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE\u2026of struggling and straining and feeling pain and exerting yourself only to have all of your efforts ultimately be for nothing. This is a metaphor\u2026for life, to Camus. We live in a universe that is so inconceivably large and complex and of a scope that we as humans can\u2019t even wrap our heads around. We live our lives\u2026with every step we take we fight against a tidal wave of things trying to kill us all the time\u2026we coast through good times struggle through bad ones\u2026only to reach the end of our lives to have to accept our fate that the universe really doesn\u2019t care about anything that you did. Certainly in a humanistic sense what you do matters\u2026it matters to the microscopic scaffolding that we\u2019ve set up on this dust speck out in the boonies of an ordinary galaxy, but on the level of the universe? Sun\u2019s going to blow up in 5 billion years, where\u2019s this podcast going to be then? Where\u2019s your stamp collection going to be that you\u2019ve worked so hard to complete?\nWe\u2019re all a little like Sisyphus in that regard\u2026we\u2019re all rolling these boulders up our respective hills only to have it ultimately be for nothing\u2026and at the end of the last episode on Camus I made the point that maybe we ARE all like Sisyphus in a way, but that Camus says we\u2019re only condemned by the Gods to push the boulder, not to agonize over the process\u2026and that we should strive to enjoy the process of pushing the boulder as much as we can\u2026that we should imagine Sisyphus smiling. I said all that, but I never really got to go into how Camus thinks you should be going about doing that.\nCamus gives two main strategies that Sisyphus uses to remain happy\u2026you know, even though\u2026 he\u2019s condemned for all eternity to push a boulder up a hill. Camus would say that as outsiders\u2026if we could sit on the sidelines and somehow watch Sisyphus push the boulder up the hill over and over again\u2026 it would no doubt look to us like a totally meaningless, tortuous, insane thing that Sisyphus is being forced to do. But at what point does Sisyphus realize that it\u2019s all meaningless? It\u2019s only when Sisyphus STOPS being present\u2026takes a step back and says: wait a second\u2026why am I pushing this boulder anyway? Looks around him\u2026can\u2019t make sense of it and deems it all to be meaningless, it\u2019s only at that point that this concept of meaning comes into play at all.\n10 seconds ago he was just pushing a boulder. It wasn\u2019t until he stopped and reflected on the fact that he was pushing the boulder\u2026 that he started feeling like something was lacking. This is an example of a recurring theme that comes up in every single one of Camus\u2019 books. It\u2019s the contrast between reflection and lived experience. Camus would say think about what you\u2019re doing whenever you stop to reflect on something. You stop doing whatever it is you\u2019re doing\u2026 and you use your capacity to reason to try to make sense of things by asking a bunch of questions. Why am I pushing this boulder up the hill? Why am I here? Why do my actions matter?\nWell consider for a second just how presumptuous and arrogant that whole reasoning process is. I\u2019m going to take this narrow, human, rational scope that I have called reason\u2026a scope that is limited and biased and existing really only because its sufficient at allowing my ancestors to pick mangos and reproduce\u2026and I\u2019m going to use this tool and impose this rationality onto the UNIVERSE\u2026and see what conclusions I arrive at when it comes to what the whole purpose of it is. Right. What if reason is not the right tool for the job? What if you had some rusty hammer held together by string and some old Allen wrench from IKEA and someone told you to put together a space shuttle. You\u2019d say, are you serious? I mean, I can try\u2026I guess. The same way an Allen wrench is not the right tool for putting together a space shuttle, reflection and the human capacity to reason is not the right tool for understanding things like the meaning or non-meaning of the things that you do.\nAgain, keep in mind that this critique of reason is very popular among the thinkers of this era\u2026 and it\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re going to talk about with the Frankfurt School. But anyway, the way Sisyphus deals with this absurdity of the universe\u2026the way he deals with the fact that bad sometimes triumphs over good and that my grandma died and I didn\u2019t want her to and that my car broke down and that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real, the way that he deals with all this stuff\u2026Camus says Sisyphus makes his rock his thing.\nWhat he means is Sisyphus is happy\u2026because he chooses to fully engage himself in his work. So if reflecting on what the ultimate meaning of pushing the boulder is is never going to leave us with a satisfactory answer\u2026why not focus ALL of your effort on being engaged in the task you\u2019re currently doing? See to Camus\u2026reflection is good\u2026it certainly is a necessary part of life\u2026but there\u2019s a point of diminishing returns. You can reflect too much\u2026and all it\u2019s going to do at that point is deteriorate the quality of your lived experience.\nNo, accept the absurdity of the universe\u2026and then immerse yourself back into being more fully engaged in the tasks you care about. What Sisyphus does\u2026is he learns to love his rock that he pushes up the hill. He studies all the little grooves in the rock\u2026all the different ways the grooves interact wit"}, "episode_82": {"date": "2017-8-26", "text": "Posted on August 26, 2017\nEpisode 109 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #109 on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo whenever you\u2019re navigating the waters of a set of ideas that you disagree with\u2026which seems inevitable for all of us given the next couple months of this show\u2026one thing that\u2019s really important to consider is to put yourself in the shoes of the people that you disagree with\u2026and try to consider where THEY\u2019RE coming from with all this. One thing I like to do is I like to imagine myself AS that other person\u2026I like to imagine I woke up this morning and I sat down with my family at breakfast and I held ALL the strong convictions that they hold about a particular subject that I disagree with\u2026then I like to imagine\u2026if I was this person, how would I see my actual self and the views that I have about things? In other words, where do they think I\u2019m coming from with my views being someone who disagrees with them?\nSee the reason I do this exercise is because I know that what Nietzsche said is true. I realize how strong of an incentive I have as a person to attach myself to some group or some cause that\u2019s bigger than myself. Glean a sense of identity from the process\u2026feel all the good feelings that come along with fighting against some evil out there in the world. But a necessary part of that whole process\u2026is identifying some evil that you\u2019re fighting against\u2026and what that often looks like in practice is finding some group of evil people\u2026that you\u2019re fighting against. But here\u2019s an important question to ask\u2026if you were them\u2026would YOU think you were evil?\nDo these evil people\u2026view themselves as villains cackling and twirling their mustache in some super hero movie? Or do these people believe that they are acting as a force of good in the world? Almost always it\u2019s going to be the latter, and it\u2019s an important distinction to make. Because if there\u2019s some group of people that you\u2019ve deemed to be evil that you want to do away with\u2026you have to examine your tactics\u2026it\u2019s not enough to just be a bundle of emotion screaming at people in the streets, or punching someone in the face, or bombing them out of existence. Ideas live on long after any nuclear fallout.\nYou don\u2019t do away with an evil idea\u2026 until you fight and win a war of ideas. And human psychology 101 says that you don\u2019t change people\u2019s minds by coming to the conversation labeling them as evil right off the bat, condescending them and screaming at them. They\u2019re gonna clam up and not even consider your ideas. That\u2019s just not how ideas spread or most people change their minds. Ideas spread\u2026 over millions of conversations between individual human beings coming together with a genuine interest in where the other one is coming from and a desire to show this quote evil group of people, how their true interests align with yours.\nWhat I mean is: it\u2019s so easy for a capitalist to look at a Marxist and say: look at this utopianistic, lazy, evil moron. You\u2019re either too lazy to work\u2026or aren\u2019t clever enough to compete and provide value to people so what do you wanna do? You want to watch the world burn and bring about your evil, totally GENIUS system that\u2019s failed every time it\u2019s been tried and get ANOTHER 100 million people killed.\nIt\u2019s so easy for a Marxist to look at a capitalist and say: look at this gluttonous, evil pig living a life of excess on the backs of 100 million people? Try hundreds of millions of miserable workers sewing sleeves onto shirts and making dollar store figurines all over the globe\u2026 just so you can sit on your yacht, evilly taking advantage of the surplus made possible by their exploitation and then wrap yourself in the flag of hard work as your way of doing it.\nNow no matter what side of that you fall on you realize that this isn\u2019t an accurate depiction of where you\u2019re coming from\u2026\u2026as someone participating in a capitalist system that\u2019s not what you\u2019re about\u2026for example, hi\u2026I\u2019m not evil\u2026 my names bruce and I have a peanut butter business. I was born into a world where you need to make money to survive\u2026I bring thousands of people enjoyment every day by making this peanut butter that they love\u2026and not only do I get to use that money to buy stuff I want, but I get to employ other people which allows them to go on and buy stuff that THEY want and support their families. This is a symbiotic, beautiful system where we help each other as people.\nIf you\u2019re a Marxist, you\u2019re not some lazy, evil hippie. Think about it from a Marxist perspective, they live every day of their lives seeing millions of people all around them being exploited, underpaid to go do work that they hate every single day because they\u2019re trapped in an economic system that\u2019s based on an outdated style of thinking from the 1700\u2019s. A Marxist talking to a worker in a capitalist society would be very similar to talking to a peasant in the feudal system\u2026and you can imagine how no matter how many arguments the peasant gave you about how, hey well at least I had it better than my grandfather who got sold into slavery\u2026and at least I have my family around me and get to work the land\u2026look, it\u2019s a symbiotic, beautiful system\u2026they own the land\u2026I work the land\u2026no matter how many arguments the peasant gave you\u2026 you can imagine wanting to make them aware that things can be better than being a peasant in the middle ages.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: somebody can be mistaken, misinformed or just not agree with you and not be an evil person. We have such a strong tendency to do it, but when you just label somebody evil for some belief they hold\u2026It shuts down discourse. It robs you of the opportunity to potentially learn something from that person or from finding out where they\u2019re coming from and helping them see a different perspective. Simone De Beauvoir would have a lot to say about not turning other human beings into these objects, of evil and instead thinking of them first as fellow human beings going through the same thing you are.\nAnyway, continuing from last time. The Frankfurt School was a group of thinkers looking at western, industrialized society confused as to why Marx\u2019s prophecy wasn\u2019t coming true. If the exploited class\u2026 always rises up and overthrows the ruling class\u2026 why hadn\u2019t there been a workers revolution in the west by the time of the interwar years in Germany? The answer to this question that the Frankfurt School gives\u2026is that Marx was wrong. Marx oversimplified the whole situation. His problem\u2026 was that he tried to explain the entire history and future of the world solely in terms of economics\u2026in terms of this inevitable, dialectical process of change where it\u2019s just a matter of time until the exploited class overthrows the ruling class\u2026but much in keeping with the thinking of his time, he fails to take into account the variables of individual human psychology\u2026in other words, what if members of the exploited class\u2026didn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being exploited? What if there was somehow a way to convince the peasants in the feudal system, that everything around them was great and that they were totally free\u2026would we see any peasant revolts in that world?\n\nThe Frankfurt School\u2026pulling ideas from Marx, Hegel and more recent revelations in Freudian Psychology\u2026makes the case\u2026that the only reason there hasn\u2019t been a workers revolution in the west\u2026lies in a problem of what they call \u201cclass consciousness\u201d. The workers of the west, were sort of bewitched and beguiled when they saw all the cool new stuff humans are able to do now that capitalism is responsible for\u2026the power of industry\u2026increased levels of efficiency\u2026the scientific and technological progress that capitalism produces\u2026they\u2019ve seen these changes, have been raised to believe that this stuff is the measure of progress and that this is just HOW the world is now and to not question it\u2026all the while immersed in a system that from birth tells them they are first and foremost a worker and consumer, through media tells them how to act, think and feel, programs into them false needs, sells them one product after another to satisfy these false needs, socially alienates them, keeps them confused and scared, provides them with an illusion of political freedom and through many different types of coercion gets them never to question the fact that all of this rapid technological progress is only made possible by the exploitation of other human beings. In other words, the workers of the west no longer resemble the free-thinking proletariat that Marx talked about rising up\u2026they\u2019ve been indoctrinated to love their chains in a sense.\nNow that\u2019s a big accusation and it\u2019s gonna take a couple episodes to unpack where they\u2019re coming from. Maybe the best place to start is to talk about their critique of enlightenment style thinking in general\u2026now keep in mind\u2026The members of the Frankfurt School\u2026are FANS of enlightenment style thinking. They\u2019re not saying that reason is bad or science is bad\u2026they\u2019re just saying there are certain consequences to enlightenment style thinking that as a species we\u2019re not adequately accounting for.\nFlashback to the beginning of the enlightenment. Western Europe\u2026it\u2019s been over a thousand years of religious dogma, and some thinkers are committed to the task of producing an understanding of the world that\u2019s based on reason instead of faith. The Age of Reason, it\u2019s often called. Certain thinkers of the Frankfurt School would ask the question\u2026what exactly is it that we\u2019re doing when we use our faculty of reason to arrive at an understanding of the world? For example, when you conduct an experiment on a plant and you arrive at the conclusion that, hey if I rub this plant over here on this cut, it makes it heal twice as quickly! What we\u2019re ultimately doing there\u2026is yes, reasoning to knowledge about things\u2026but it\u2019s always reasoning to knowledge about how we as human beings can control nature to our benefit. In other words, instead of being totally at the mercy of nature like we\u2019ve been in the past\u2026instead of believing that lightning bolt, hit that horse over there, cause Zeus is mad the Bronco\u2019s beat the Cowboys on Sunday\u2026we instead use reason\u2026 to try to understand things in nature like weather and clouds and electricity\u2026the hope being\u2026that we can control them to our benefit, as human beings.\nSee this is the point they\u2019d want to underscore\u2026it\u2019s easy to miss that underlying motivation that we have\u2026you can be that person all day: oh, I\u2019m a lover of knowledge, all kinds\u2026I\u2019m a voracious reader\u2026I never even use the word voracious unless it\u2019s about my reading\u2026but what the Frankfurt School would point out is that there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re not reading and memorizing the phone book. Why? Because you\u2019re not an indiscriminate lover of knowledge whatever it is\u2026you\u2019re a lover of knowledge that is useful to you, and that has a huge effect on the questions you ask and the areas you focus on. Well, so too with thinkers and scientists back during the enlightenment. When we use reason to arrive at knowledge it\u2019s not indiscriminate\u2026it is by its very nature, anthropocentric and humanistic\u2026it\u2019s always us trying to understand nature\u2026SO THAT we can control it and use it to our benefit. But here\u2019s thing: human beings are ALSO a part of nature\u2026they\u2019re in no way exempt from this process of using reason to try to understand them better so that we can control them. And this has been a GOOD THING historically speaking!\nWhen Jean Jacques Rousseau makes the claim that the true nature of human beings is to be noble savages that are then corrupted by certain aspects of civilization\u2026that is him using reason to arrive at an understanding about human beings\u2026SO THAT he can then build his political philosophy on top of it and arrive at a system of government that yes, controls human beings in some ways\u2026but benefits everyone overall. This is a reason based approach to the problem of government\u2026it\u2019s FAR superior to a faith based approach to solving that problem like, for example, the Divine Right of Kings\u2026but we have to be aware of the fact that reason itself is pretty narrow in scope and in the business of controlling nature for the benefit of the people doing the reasoning\u2026and that when it\u2019s applied to the task of trying to decide how people should be oriented economically and politically\u2026even brilliant thinkers reasoning with the best intentions historically often have arrived at systems that harness control over this \u201chuman being\u201d section of nature\u2026and reduce them into rational categories that fit within a larger system that they think is gonna benefit everyone.\nFor example, members of a state within Rousseau\u2019s political system. Workers and consumers within a capitalist system. Thinkers of the Frankfurt School are making the case that these systems no doubt helped make the world a better place than it was before in the 1700\u2019s\u2026but here\u2019s the thing\u2026it\u2019s not the 1700\u2019s anymore. It is an outdated, lost cause to try to use reason to break down and define some giant classification that every human being should think of themselves as from birth. Reason is great\u2026but it has its limitations and tendencies. It\u2019s not that we shouldn\u2019t use reason to best organize our society economically\u2026but we need to be self-aware of these limitations and tendencies.\nThis is the point\u2026what some thinkers in the Frankfurt School are getting at here\u2026is that because reason is always aiming towards harnessing control over aspects of nature that benefit the person doing the reasoning\u2026you can imagine how easily when it\u2019s applied to the control of human beings\u2026that it can devolve into fascism. This is the explanation for how it was possible for the world to be technologically and culturally more advanced than we had ever been in human history\u2026only to devolve into the most inhuman crisis in history in WW2. That the natural end game\u2026of Enlightenment Style, reason based thinking\u2026is fascism. The more enlightened of a person that you become\u2026the more you use reason to ground your beliefs in things\u2026the LESS you believe in cosmically determined ways that human beings must behave. This is familiar\u2026God is dead, right? In a post enlightenment world, in a world where there are no moral substrates and people have a tendency to harness control over nature in a way that benefits them\u2026all it takes is one Adolph Hitler\u2026one person that had a bad childhood and never went to therapy that likes the idea of people chanting their name and posters of their face and controlling people. All it takes is ONE OF THOSE\u2026 for fascism to potentially emerge.\nNow of course I\u2019m joking about the bad childhood thing, but it\u2019s actually not that far off the way that the Frankfurt School thought we should be looking at someone like an Adolph Hitler. Theodor Adorno\u2026 one of the thinkers of the Frankfurt School actually devised a personality test called The California F-Scale\u2026F standing for fascism. It\u2019s essentially just a bunch of questions designed to determine how fascist or likely to support a fascist you are. Now, that personality test in particular was heavily criticized, but the point Adorno and other members of the Frankfurt school want to make\u2026 is that fascism may be NATURALLY where enlightenment style thinking goes\u2026but it\u2019s not NECESSARILY where it has to go. And that as a species living in this post-enlightenment world\u2026we need to be aware of the increased risk level we\u2019re at for fascist movements emerging and we should probably be taking steps towards identifying the Adolph Hitlers\u2026when they\u2019re in art school\u2026before they become the Adolph hitlers invading Czechoslovakia where we have to fight a bloody war where tens of millions of people die. The thinking behind the F-Scale\u2026 was that it takes a pretty extreme psychological outlook on the world to think that it\u2019s a good idea for you to become the next Adolph Hitler\u2026maybe if we mandated that everyone took this F-Scale test throughout their life\u2026we\u2019d be able to catch that sort of black and white thinking that leads to you BECOMING an Adolph Hitler. So again, we shouldn\u2019t do AWAY with enlightenment style thinking just because it leads to fascism\u2026it\u2019s kind of like having a pool installed in your backyard and you have small children around. It\u2019s not that pools are bad because there\u2019s this new danger we have to consider\u2026it\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have a pool\u2026we just need to make sure we put up a good fence around the pool\u2026we need to make sure we develop some fascism safeguards to make sure things don\u2019t get super out of control like they did in 1930\u2019s Germany.\nNow let\u2019s move on to some of the actual critique of modern, Western society particularly in the United States. One of the most influential thinkers of the Frankfurt School was a guy named Herbert Marcuse\u2026he wrote a book called One Dimensional Man that would go on to be massively influential in the New Left protests of the 1960\u2019s.\nMarcuse comes out swinging in chapter one, he says:\n\u201cBy virtue of the way it has organized its technological base, contemporary industrial society tends to be totalitarian. For \u201ctotalitarian\u201d is not only a terroristic political coordination of society, but also a non-terroristic economic-technical coordination which operates through the manipulation of needs by vested interests.\u201d\nNow, you may hear that and think\u2026well that seems a little extreme. The United States is not even CLOSE to being a totalitarian society\u2026what\u2019s Marcuse talking about?\nHere\u2019s the definition of Totalitarian as given to me by dictionary.com:\nadjective\n1.\nof or relating to a centralized government that does not tolerate parties of differing opinion and that exercises dictatorial control over many aspects of life.\n2.\nexercising control over the freedom, will, or thought of others;authoritarian; autocratic.\n\nWhat Marcuse would say is that you can have your sort of run of the mill, clich\u00e9 Totalitarian society where the government forces citizens to do things, centralized political power\u2026 typically in a one-party system\u2026 and any political opposition that gets too loud is immediately introduced to the bottom of the nearest lake. You can have that.\nYou can also have a government that claims not to be Totalitarian, but any reasonable person looking at them from the outside would OBVIOUSLY call what they\u2019re doing Totalitarianism. Look we\u2019re not FORCING upon you what you do all day\u2026you have a choice!\u2026you can dig ditches all day, you can crush rocks\u2026you can help build this statue that\u2019s a monument to our supreme leader, you can be in the military. Look, we WELCOME political opposition in our great land\u2026that\u2019s why we have democratic elections every year\u2026yeah 99% of the vote always comes in for one guy, but that just speaks to how great of a candidate he is. In other words, a society that masquerades as though it\u2019s NOT totalitarian\u2026gives its citizens the ILLUSION of freedom without them actually having a choice in the matter at all.\nMarcuse says that when you take a close look at the United States\u2026when you look at the government and culture exerting control over the behavior of the citizens\u2026when you look at the illusion of political involvement that is given to people\u2026when you look at the barriers put in place to keep any extreme dissenting ideas out\u2026the United States starts to resemble one of these Totalitarian societies enslaving its people\u2026but instead of the ultimate goal being so that the Supreme Leader can hang out with Dennis Rodman\u2026the goal of THIS particular totalitarian society is hyper-technological progress.\nLet\u2019s break this down, let\u2019s first talk about the illusion of political involvement Marcuses referencing. Marcuse would say that one of the inevitable byproducts of a Capitalist system\u2026is the conflation of political power with money. You see it all around you\u2026you wonder why nobody ever changes anything. Marcuse says the reason why is because that\u2019s\u2026 just\u2026 capitalism. It\u2019s always going to happen, even if it\u2019s just in private. The people and companies with the most money are always going to be able to pay politicians to influence legislation in their favor. These are the people that REALLY have political influence. Couple that with the fact that there is a real, demonstrable connection between the number of advertising dollars spent on a political campaign, and the number of people voting for the candidate. People get their political opinions\u2026from that box in their front room that gives them all their other opinions. Even if you were the most well intentioned individual in the world that wanted to run for Congress and change things from the inside\u2026to even be able to sit on the committees influential enough to change these things, you\u2019d need 20 years in Congress\u2026that\u2019s 20 years of spending your days fundraising because you need money\u2026because the way you win elections is by spending more money on smear ads than the person you\u2019re running against. It\u2019s a system designed around linking money to political influence. I mean if you were some billionaire\u2026and you had NEVER been in politics ever\u2026NO idea how it works on the inside\u2026if you had enough money\u2026you could theoretically self fund most of your own campaign and there\u2019s a very REAL chance you could convince enough people to vote for you just because you ran a lot of TV ads and the people only had two choices.\nThat\u2019s another thing Marcuse talks about\u2026the whole two party structure. These two parties seem to disagree on a lot of stuff\u2026they disagree on stem cells and illegal immigration and whether or not we should legalize marijuana. But Marcuse would want to direct your attention to all the things these two parties DO agree on that leave you as a voter, effectively without a choice in the matter. Any time you have a bi-partisan consensus on anything\u2026as a voter\u2026you essentially don\u2019t have a choice. Marcuse would say the two parties are just competing to preserve the existing framework\u2026not exploring real alternatives that may be better for people. And you may say, what are you talking about\u2026we have third party candidates! Marcuse would say: right\u2026they\u2019re just not allowed at the prime time televised debates\u2026not covered by any major news outlets\u2026it would require a voter to do some digging to even know who they are\u2026there\u2019s of course the feeling that you\u2019re throwing away your vote when it should be used on the REAL election going on. The existence of these third parties provides the illusion of a diverse array of political opinions to choose from\u2026when in reality everyone\u2019s gonna go to Fox News and CNN to reinforce their outlook on the world anyway.\nMarcuse would say that you\u2019re living in a society\u2026 where from the moment you\u2019re born you are conditioned with the idea that you are first and foremost a worker and a consumer. When you\u2019re a kid, people ask you what you want to be when you grow up\u2026the implication there being, what work are you going to be doing that will allow you to get money to consume the things you want to consume. Our whole public school system is designed around the idea that it benefits us as a nation if our children have a baseline of an understanding that will turn them into tax-paying productive citizens. Paying taxes on earned income from working 8 hours a day\u2026paying taxes on consumption. When somebody says to you, tell me about yourself. The first thing most people offer up that describes who they are\u2026is their work. When they\u2019re done telling you about their work\u2026they\u2019ll often go on to tell you all the things they like to consume in their free time. Your job in this world is to wake up\u2026work for the majority of your day\u2026then come home, and consume things that make you feel just good enough to go back to your job the next day\u2026all so that this engine of hyper-technological advancement keeps powering forward. Some of you out there may love your job\u2026the reality of the global population is that most people don\u2019t. Most people don\u2019t hate their job\u2026they\u2019ve learned to accept it as an inevitability\u2026but they\u2019d never be doing this stuff if it wasn\u2019t required of them to earn enough green paper to sustain a living. Right there\u2026Marcuse would say\u2026life, isn\u2019t an end in itself in the United States\u2026no, in this society you have to EARN the right to life by providing some good or service to people around you in your society.\nYou know it\u2019s been said of Capitalism that it\u2019s a beautiful system because it\u2019s sort of like a forced altruism. You give the people around you something they like, or else you starve to death. We\u2019re just human beings engaging in mutually beneficial transactions giving each other what we want. Marcuse would say\u2026yeah exactly\u2026it\u2019s FORCED altruism. Look at how the very structure of Capitalism FORCES people to conform to the way that things already are and not change anything too much. What he means is: that in a society where people didn\u2019t have to earn green paper or else starve to death\u2026in a society where people just do whatever interests them each day\u2026no idea or activity is too far outside of what the status quo is for them to be able to explore it\u2026whereas in a Capitalist society where you give me something I want or else you starve to death\u2026the existing culture and what people want\u2026 dictates the limitations of what you can do and serves to reinforce the way things already are. For example imagine a culture where nobody saw value in reading and interpreting philosophy. Marcuse would say\u2026no matter how much you think it would benefit the world to give people access to philosophy\u2026you\u2019re not gonna be doing a philosophy podcast\u2026you need people on Patreon that believe in the cause as well or else you\u2019re gonna starve to death. And Marcuse says in reality what happens is you don\u2019t want to be a social outcast and so you just conform to provide some good or service that is endorsed by the current way that the culture is. It perpetuates itself.\nSome of you out there may be saying: ok I don\u2019t think of myself as fundamentally a worker and consumer\u2026and I don\u2019t feel this enormous sense of pressure to work or else I\u2019m going to starve to death. And by the way all of this is sounding very conspiratorial\u2026like who\u2019s enforcing this world you\u2019re talking about\u2026what are you gonna tell me next? The bankers or the illuminati are pulling the puppet strings making sure I stay conditioned to love my chains so much that I don\u2019t even FEEL like I\u2019m being enslaved as I\u2019m BEING enslaved?\nNo, Marcuse would say: it\u2019s far more insidious than that. The reality is: good people with good intentions every day are perpetuating the system without even realizing it because they\u2019re immersed in it. Next time we\u2019re going to be talking about something the Frankfurt School calls The Culture Industry\u2026Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer\u2026we\u2019re gonna talk about all the different ways they think movies, TV Shows, advertising, social media program you to feel like you need things you don\u2019t actually need, keeping you alienated from other people chasing something to consume that\u2019s going to solve your problems if only you work hard enough to afford it, to keep you working and consuming.\nAnother response you may have to Marcuse is, ok\u2026let\u2019s say I\u2019m just some wage slave that\u2019s been indoctrinated to love my chains. Is there nothing to be said for the fact that the system works? In other words\u2026there\u2019s no guarantee in this universe that a political or economic system is going to work when it\u2019s tried\u2026even if you see me as a slave, even if I\u2019m just living in some really clever and insidious totalitarian society\u2026you can\u2019t deny the system WORKS, Marcuse. Technology is improving at a rapid rate. Society 99% of the time functions well. For most people, at least in the United States, there\u2019s the possibility of economic mobility, the benefits OF this focus on technological progress are distributed to the consumers\u2026is there nothing to be said for any of that?\nMarcuse would say\u2026you\u2019re right! That\u2019s one of the most diabolical parts of all of this\u2026that attitude is based on rational thought, but it\u2019s that attitude that sustains the way things are. Marcuse would say, sure\u2026rapid technological progress IS being made\u2026but is that progress overall as a species? Is having the iPhone 12 more important than the people putting it together that are jumping off the factories committing suicide during their lunch break? Yes, the system works\u2026but what do we have to sacrifice as a species to be able to achieve that world?\nBy the way, Marcuse\u2019s not saying we should throw out capitalism tomorrow and implement Marxism and everything would be great. He\u2019s not advocating for some revolution to occur. He explicitly says that if you instantly did away with Capitalism it would probably be the greatest catastrophe in the history of the world. You can\u2019t just take people\u2026that have been conditioned from birth to look at every aspect of their lives in terms of socially isolated labor and consumption\u2026drop them in a Marxist society and expect them to do well. Nobody\u2019s going to work\u2026everyone\u2019s gonna be looking for happiness in the wrong places they\u2019ve been conditioned to look for it. It would be a disaster. No, if this country ever does away with the Capitalist model\u2026Marcuse says it\u2019s going to happen slowly over the course of generations. It\u2019s gonna be a slow awakening and re-education of people to be aware of the chains\u2026to be aware of the suffering of the people that make the system possible\u2026to be aware of the ways their behavior is conditioned and maintained. Marcuse would ask, is this true freedom?\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_83": {"date": "2017-9-7", "text": "Posted on September 7, 2017\nEpisode 110 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #110 on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo it\u2019s been said about the workers in the United States post WW2\u2026 that they found themselves in a very unique situation in terms of what options are made available to them. Capitalism\u2026 massive improvements that come along with it in technology and efficiency\u2026has made it possible for the average person, to do things only the super rich had been able to do throughout human history.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat for consumers in this post WW2 world\u2026people no longer need to live together under one roof like it\u2019s little house on the prairie, sharing a communal horse and doing shadow puppetry on the walls for entertainment\u2026no we live in a new world now. We live in a world where, it is entirely feasible for the average consumer, to buy their own house (far better than a shack on a prairie) buy their own car (with the power 300 of those communal horses) and through the advent of mass media and entertainment broadcasting have instant access to MOUNTAINS of art and cultural artifacts to consume with the push of a button. (little bit better than trying to make your hand look like an alligator chomping on the wall)\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, two members of the Frankfurt School who co-wrote the book The Dialectic of Enlightenment, would no doubt agree that Capitalism is responsible for these changes in what is possible for the average person. But they\u2019d want to ask the question: Why is it\u2026 that there seems to be such a strong correlation between the trappings of Capitalism, and the alienation of society? In other words, when people get the house and they get the car and they have access to more art than they could ever consume\u2026why is it that the worker in the 20th century seems to be the most alienated from other people around them, and the most alienated from the process of creating world they\u2019re living in\u2026 in human history?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat another way to think of that house that everyone\u2019s able to buy now\u2026is that it\u2019s a box. That instead of being a member of a local community and feeling like an integral part of a group of people\u2026now, practically nobody knows their neighbors, they just go home and shut themselves away in this box, and here\u2019s the important part: it\u2019s a product that was sold to you\u2026 that house is a product\u2026that if you aren\u2019t mindful and take effort to prevent it from happening, it\u2019s a product that aids in this process of alienation from other people. But that\u2019s not the only box we live in\u2026think about it, instead of sharing a communal horse where you might have to talk to some people\u2026you might have to figure out who gets the horse when, you might have a conversation with a fellow traveler on the road\u2026now, nobody talks to other drivers going down the freeway\u2026again, they just get in their car and shut themselves away in this box, a product that was sold to them where if they\u2019re not careful aids in this process of alienation. What Adorno and Horkheimer are going to go on to say here\u2026is that this other box in your front room that delivers you all the TV shows and movies and music and all the other culture that you consume\u2026that these things are ALSO products that are sold to you, that serve this process of alienation.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee where they\u2019re coming from is an old Marxist critique of capitalist society\u2026that in a more simple, non-capitalist structure people do work and there\u2019s a very obvious connection between the specific task they\u2019re doing and some benefit either to themselves or to the community they\u2019re involved in. Let\u2019s give two examples, one more simple one less simple. Let\u2019s say your community needs water and you have to dig a well. Now, nobody out there is passionate about well digging. Digging that well may be horrible work, it may take you all day\u2026you may be sweating and covered in dirt and want a back rub at the end of the day\u2026but at least as you are digging that well\u2026you feel a connection to the work that you\u2019re doing. You know that you are digging that well so that you, your family and the families living around you that you care about will have drinking water. Not only do you feel connected to the work though, but there\u2019s a sense in which you are creating the world that you\u2019re living in, alright everybody we have a problem: we don\u2019t have any water\u2026the solution to this problem is we\u2019re going to dig a well\u2026grab a shovel and let\u2019s do this. You\u2019re not profiting in terms of green paper, you\u2019re profiting in terms of social recognition\u2026when you\u2019re walking around town\u2026you\u2019re the person who dug the well so that everyone else could have drinking water.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow new example\u2026let\u2019s say you were a part of a non-capitalistic trading based culture. Say you\u2019re an artisan that specializes in making clocks. Well in that sort of world it is still likely you feel a sense of connection to the work that you\u2019re doing. I mean, being able to tell the time is an absolutely crucial thing for society to function properly. Say I need a job to do\u2026and it turns out I\u2019m really good at making clocks\u2026 I\u2019m Steve the clockmaker\u2026now in that world my work may not be fun and games all the time I may dropkick a clock or two across my shop\u2026But later on when I go out in public\u2026when I see my clocks all over town helping people\u2026keeping society in sync and on time\u2026I feel like I\u2019m a part of what makes this town work\u2026I feel like I play a small role in the creation and maintenance of this town.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow how does Marx think this dynamic changes in a Capitalist society? Well what do we love about Capitalism? Not only are people in competition to constantly build a better mousetrap\u2026but they\u2019re in competition to build that mousetrap more efficiently than the people they\u2019re competing with. Hyper efficiency becomes an extremely important aspect of how goods and services are produced. Marx would say this is dangerous\u2026that when an economic system stops looking at people as ends in themselves and starts looking at them in terms of being a means to some end of hyper technological progress and efficiency\u2026there is no guarantee you\u2019re going to be doing work that you feel connected to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee because let\u2019s say I\u2019m clockmaker Steve and I\u2019m really good at making clocks, I have a system and on a good day I can produce around 10 clocks start to finish. Well take 100 people and put them on an assembly line\u2026make their job when the clock comes by you put this piece of metal into this groove and send it down the line\u2026those people can make 10,000 clocks in a day. Now that\u2019s super efficient. That satisfies the needs of capitalism perfectly. But Marx would ask at what cost? What that does is alienate the worker from feeling connected to the purpose of their work. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re part of the process of creating the world they\u2019re living in\u2026there\u2019s just this product being given to them by designers on high that they\u2019ve never met\u2026 and their job is to put a piece of metal in a groove and fuel this process of churning out products as efficiently as possible.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSure many of you out there can relate to this with your job. So I used to work in a Grocery Warehouse. What you\u2019d expect\u2026long days\u2026physical labor\u2026stores order the food they need and the job was stacking cases of food onto pallets that then get shipped off to the store. Now doing that job, technically you are doing work that performs an important function for society, you\u2019re delivering people their food, but I can tell you none of the people working there thought of the job like they were Farmer Brown and I\u2019m bringing the people of the world the nutritious food they need nourish their bodies. No, it just becomes an 8-10 hour drone of stacking heavy boxes onto a pallet. The people working there would say things all the time like, yeah the job is boring and it\u2019s hard and it is kind of grunt work\u2026but it pays well, we have a really good union and great benefits.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s the argument against Marx on the Capitalist side, right? Well, there are many arguments against Marx that we\u2019ll get into but one of the primary ones is that yeah, the reality of the world is that some people have to do jobs that they don\u2019t necessarily like that need to get done\u2026but those people that do those jobs generally get paid more to do those jobs that nobody else wants to do! Which then in turn allows them to go home, yes run down from a days work, but able to experience a higher quality of life that most other people don\u2019t get to experience. It all balances itself out!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Adorno and Horkheimer would say to that is, cool so for eight hours a day, a third of their life these people get to go to a job that alienates them and sucks the life out of them\u2026and their reward for doing that is more of this green paper that allows them to go home and consume stuff that makes them feel just good enough to get up and do it again the next day\u2026in other words, perpetuating the cycle of working and consumption. That\u2019s what you are when it all comes down to it. Work and consume. Work and consume. Work in an environment that alienates you\u2026then go home and feel even MORE alienated as you try to spiritually lift yourself up by going into consumption mode.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee that\u2019s the thing they\u2019d want to underscore and it\u2019s going to be an important point when it comes to their views on TV and movies and music so I wanna mention it briefly now\u2026when you are a consumer\u2026you don\u2019t have an unbridled level of freedom when it comes to choosing what things you\u2019re going to be consuming. I mean I guess in theory you could choose to just never buy anything for your entire life, but short of looking like Tom Hanks in castaway, actually even HE had Wilson. 99.9% of people buy stuff\u2026 and there\u2019s this subtle, alienating dynamic of the fact\u2026 that the life you build for yourself in our modern culture is highly connected to the things you\u2019re able to consume\u2026 and the choices you have for what you\u2019re gonna consume are always given to you by somebody else, again by some designer on high that you\u2019ve never met. Because of this in a strange way, the products that are available for you to consume, set up the parameters for what you can do with your life. That as a consumer it can start to feel alienating\u2026almost like what building your life even is at a fundamental level\u2026is just navigating a world that doesn\u2019t feel like your own\u2026you\u2019re just this consumer in world full of products that were designed by a handful of people for the sake of mass appeal, your role is just to pick which of these products you\u2019re going to consume each day.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow we\u2019ll expand on that in a sec, but the thing I really want to make clear here is how strongly Adorno and Horkheimer want to call into question the concept of \u201cleisure time\u201d. Remember, the ultimate goal of the Frankfurt School during this time is to get to the bottom of how workers in the west can be in the conditions they\u2019re in but still not feel as though they\u2019re a member of an exploited class of people\u2026and one of the first places they look to try to find an answer to this is to look at how workers spend their time after they get off of work.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat they notice is that people tend to look at their lives in terms of this constant interplay between work time and leisure time. You\u2019re either at work\u00a0doing what you have to do to sustain life\u2026or you\u2019re enjoying some well deserved leisure time doing the things you actually want to be doing. They\u2019d point out how in capitalist societies there\u2019s often this attitude of\u2026work\u2026well that\u2019s just something you gotta do, we ALL gotta earn a living\u2026It\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s gotta get done! I gotta wake up early\u2026yeah it\u2019s pretty much the same thing day after day at work nothing really new\u2026I can act like a version of myself there but I can\u2019t REALLY be myself I have to paint on a smile for Brenda in accounting\u2026I have to use all the right politically correct terms that a professional decorum requires\u2026certainly is a sacrifice, but look all that I have to sacrifice in terms of individuality and novelty in my work life\u2026is more than made up for by the stuff I get to do in my leisure time\u2026that\u2019s when I TRULY get to be who I am! That\u2019s the attitude people often have.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell Adorno would ask: how are people in these modern, industrialized societies typically spending their leisure time? Well I\u2019ll tell you what they\u2019re NOT doing. They\u2019re not learning a foreign language or doing a biblical exegesis or memorizing the encyclopedia\u2026in other words they\u2019re not doing things that are highly mentally taxing that make them into a better person more aware of the world around them\u2026what do they usually do? They do stuff that requires little to no effort\u2026they do stuff that\u2019s relaxing\u2026and who could possibly blame them\u2026they just worked all day. What do you want them to do? Come home and work more? Is that what life is? Constant working until you die of a heart attack when you\u2019re 33 years old? No, they want to relax. They want to be entertained\u2026they don\u2019t want to have to entertain themselves.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow real quick just because I\u2019m talking to THIS audience in particular\u2026this is one of the few audiences where there might be a considerable number of people confused like what do you mean? I\u2019m learning a language in my spare time\u2026I\u2019m actually doing a biblical exegsesis while listening to this episode\u2026Adorno and Horkheimer would say you\u2019re in the EXTREME minority and in my personal experience those people are usually people that love their work so they don\u2019t feel drained after working all day\u2026they come home and want to challenge themselves with other stuff. Consider the fact that those people are the EXTREME minority in our culture\u2026the typical response when someone gets off of work is a sigh of relief. Finally, it\u2019s over! Now I can go home and relax and be entertained.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell Adorno and Horkheimer would say: here\u2019s another great thing about Capitalist society: when there\u2019s a serious demand for something\u2026somebody out there is going to find a way to create a product that meets that demand. Just so happens in this particular society there\u2019s a giant percentage of people that think of their lives in terms of work time vs leisure time\u2026a giant percentage of people that the minute they clock out of their job have a strong desire go and do stuff that doesn\u2019t require much effort so that they can relax and recharge their batteries having been alienated at work all day. What this dynamic creates is a HUGE DEMAND for some product I can consume that allows me to just relax and be entertained.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow in the early 20th century\u2026 there was a brand new invention brought to market that turned out to be INCREDIBLE at solving this problem.\u00a0Mass media. Widely disseminated. Convenient\u2026you don\u2019t even have to go to the store to consume this product\u2026it\u2019s in the front room of nearly everyone\u2019s house. You can listen to the radio in your box as you drive back to your other box that has a third box filled with shows that you can just relax and be entertained by, take the edge off.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of TV show and movie and song that people are going to have a demand for in a capitalist society\u2026think about it: if you\u2019re somebody creating a TV show that is a media product designed to fulfill a demand of what\u00a0the masses want to watch during their leisure time\u2026what kind of show do you make? What\u2019s gonna make you the most money? Do you do a public access show deconstructing quantum physics? Or do you do something like duck dynasty. Which product is going to be demanded more by the working class?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s where they\u2019re going with this. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s some evil dude named Edward J House that invented the house so that people would become more alienated from each other. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s some cabal of people at the top of the entertainment industry that are hand-selecting shows that are going to keep people working and consuming. No when you have a society where the masses are told from birth to think of themselves as workers and consumers\u2026existing in a world that they are alienated from\u2026evangelized to about how crucial their own personal financial success is\u2026in that world, things like the house, a private box I can go to and watch these entertaining shows and wind down from work\u2026thats the natural product that people have a demand for and want to consume. Movies about superheroes or science fiction that take you out of this world and insert you into another world where you can forget about the problems of this one. Video games that immerse you into a fictitious world an escape from the trials of life. Novels about a thumpin\u2019 good wizard named Harry Potter and some bald dude without a nose. We want to focus on THESE worlds that don\u2019t really exist so we can escape having to think about the one we\u2019re actually living in. That\u2019s the product workers of a Capitalist society have a huge demand for.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow if that sounds a lot like Nietzsche\u2019s concept of true world theories and the tactic used by mythology and religion to get people focused on a different world to distract them away from the problems of this one\u2026that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re saying mass media has become for people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdorno says:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn an age of spiritual disenchantment, the individual experiences the need for substitute images of the \u2018divine\u2019. It obtains these through pseudo-culture. Hollywood idols, soaps, novels, pop tunes, lyrics and film genres such as the Wild West or the Mafia movie, fashion substitute mythologies for the masses.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHollywood idols! We like to exalt these celebrities onto a pedestal and look at them as these messiah-like figures. Oh, its George Clooney! He\u2019s practically GLOWING! Formerly you may have walked in the path of some anointed figure described in a Holy Book\u2026but now I\u2019m gonna walk in the path of Clooney\u2026if I just wear that jacket that he\u2019s wearing or I buy that special curling iron so I can do my hair like the girl from that other show or if I buy the same brand of soda they\u2019re drinking in that movie maybe I can be more like my idol!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote that there\u2019s always some product that you have to consume that is what\u2019s stopping you from walking in the path of Clooney. Imagine if to walk in the path of Christ you had to buy the sandals he was wearing. Consumption has been written in to the very moral fabric of this media age. That as fundamentally a worker and consumer\u2026what your life IS within this culture is when you have a problem\u2026you buy a product to solve that problem. After a while of that message being reinforced\u2026people start to believe the fact that no matter what problem you have\u2026there\u2019s some product out there that\u2019s going to be able to solve it. Advertisers realize this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey realize that most people feel alienated from other people around them. They realize that what most people crave that they don\u2019t have is close human interaction. So they use it to their benefit\u2026they make ads that send you the message that if you buy this beverage product you\u2019re all of a sudden going to have a close knit group of friends that sit in a circle laughing, drinking it together like on the commercial. That if you buy this car\u2026some really attractive person is going to make constant eye contact with you and smile. That if you buy this BBQ\u2026all of a sudden there\u2019s going to be a close community of families in your back yard socializing and working together and your mom and dad haven\u2019t been in a loveless marriage for over 20 years.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow of course there\u2019s no guarantee once you get these products that any of these things are going to happen. There\u2019s not even a reasonable likelihood given how prone to alienation the average worker is. So what ends up happening is people get caught in this perpetual cycle of feeling empty inside, craving true close human interaction, seeing some advertisement for a product on TV that seems to have worked for the people on the commercial, buying that product, still feeling empty inside, and there\u2019s always ANOTHER product that if only I work even harder at my job and make more money, THAT\u2019S gonna put me over the edge.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo again, let\u2019s consider: are these advertisers an evil group that want people to constantly feel empty and alienated looking to products to fill that void inside of them? No! They\u2019re just trying to make as much money as possible\u2026they\u2019re just living within a capitalist system where profit is the ultimate goal. Fact is, no matter what you think about whether Capitalism is causing it, a need that a LOT of people have that isn\u2019t being filled is feeling like a loved and important member of a community. Why NOT link products to people having that feeling, it\u2019s an effective strategy!\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow these cultural products in particular\u2026TV shows, Movies, Radio\u2026these new products available to people during the 20th century changed everything. You know, it\u2019s one thing to own a peanut butter business and to sit down with a team of designers and try to figure out how we can get this peanut butter to so line up with what consumers want\u2026that whenever somebody goes to the grocery store they buy your peanut butter. There\u2019s a sense in which\u2026 the linking of popular demand\u2026 to the process of making the best peanut butter in the world is beneficial to the vast, vast majority of people. But Adorno and Horkheimer would ask: what happens when ART becomes the product that\u2019s being sold? What happens when the ultimate goal of producing cultural artifacts like movies, tv shows and radio\u2026becomes how much money we can make?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat happens, they would say, is the birth of The Culture Industry. We are in the business of producing for the masses cultural artifacts that they already have a demand for, so that we can make as much money as possible.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee there\u2019s this thing we do\u2026we reference this thing called pop-culture all the time. We reference popular culture\u2026and there\u2019s this implication that the things that are popular are popular because they arose out of some demand from the masses. But if your favorite show is The Walking Dead\u2026the people that wrote The Walking Dead didn\u2019t write it because they got millions of calls from people clamoring We want a zombie apocalypse show that showcases the bonds that human beings from different cultures form in times of stress! No, whoever wrote The Walking Dead designed a product that they thought enough people would want to watch that they could make money from it. This is a subtle, but important distinction to make for Adorno and Horkheimer\u2026because when it comes to the art you can consume\u2026it always you choosing from the limited number of selections that the culture industry has produced for you, the first and foremost purpose behind the creation of the art being, to make money and correspond with mass appeal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut this isn\u2019t what art should BE to Theodor Adorno. The popularity of art shouldn\u2019t be determined by how much it corresponds to social norms. True art should get you to think. It should get you to consider an alternative way of looking at the world. True art shouldn\u2019t be easy to consume necessarily\u2026you should have to concentrate hard to appreciate the depth of it\u2026not veg out on the couch and get a thimble full of substance in a three hour movie.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s no stopping it in a Capitalist system though. When you link the market to culture, When you turn works of art into products the market is going to consume, cultural products\u2026 start to resemble all the ways OTHER products are. They undergo a process of standardization. The people making the products figure out a formula they can use to create a product they know the masses are going to buy\u2026and then essentially just produce the same products over and over again with slight little details changed to create the illusion of novelty for the consumer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example\u2026what really is the difference between the 2016 model of a car and the 2017 model? Not much. The car company knows there\u2019s gonna be enough consumers that want a mid-sized sedan that has the features this car has. So what do they do? They essentially sell the exact same car next year\u2026with some minor cosmetic changes to the outside maybe a better GPS system inside to make the consumer feel like this is a new and exciting thing, when in reality the form of the car overall is the same thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you get a new phone\u2026the screen may be a little bigger, it may be a little easier to do certain things on it and you may look at those details and see them as big improvements, but in reality the overall form of the phone you just bought and the function it serves hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow neither of those things may bother you. So what? I like my new phone better than my old one. Call me a Capitalist pig, but I like having a better GPS system than the 2016 model. But what happens when this same dynamic is applied to TV Shows, Movies and Music? What you get\u2026is the same song written over and over again, following some formula they know is going to correspond with mass demand, with slight little details changed to create the illusion of novelty. The overall FORM of the song is the same thing\u2026it\u2019s still you bragging for three minutes about your most recent big financial purchase\u2026but the beat is a little different and it\u2019s a different person saying the words. Maybe in a different genre\u2026the song is still about worshiping the Devil and how your step-dad doesn\u2019t understand you\u2026but you switch the order that you play the three chords in and add a different guitar riff at the beginning and it allows consumers to get the same product that they know they like without actually experiencing any sort of real novelty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheodor Adorno talks about how when judging a piece of art there\u2019s this emphasis we put on the details of the piece of art\u2026oh the cinematography was AMAZING\u2026or the dialogue was so tense right there! But it\u2019s the same movie that\u2019s been released every year for the last ten years. We focus on those little details because it\u2019s the only differentiation there IS between works of art in our time, that in general it\u2019s the exact same product warmed over spoon fed to us time and time again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRom-coms. There may be little details switched around in an individual plot\u2026but overall in form a Romantic comedy is the exact same movie performing the exact same function time and time again. Same thing with Westerns. Same thing with Sit-coms. Same thing with horror movies. These are formulaic templates\u2026 that we go into the theater KNOWING exactly what to expect and how it\u2019s going to turn out before we even see it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow some of you out there may be saying\u2026well, yeah that\u2019s kind of part of the overall charm of these kinds of movies, right?\u00a0Yeah I know it\u2019s not Schindler\u2019s list\u2026and in the back of my mind I know where it\u2019s going in the end\u2026but look, somebody can love chocolate ice cream as a product because of how it makes them feel\u2026can\u2019t they like Rom-coms as a product because of how they make them feel?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheodor Adorno would say, yeah\u2026but understand that life imitates art. Don\u2019t underestimate the level of impact the consumption of these products is having on the way you look at the world. That we watch these movies and TV shows and listen to these songs\u2026and there\u2019s a part of us that inserts ourselves into the story\u2026and makes it real. Like have you ever watched a horror movie about some demon that\u2019s possessing some object\u2026and then later on that night or the next day you\u2019re in a dark room and you feel just a little bit more creeped out than you would otherwise be because what if the demon\u2019s haunting MY condo now. Yeah, you have to believe DEMONS are a possibility for that movie to affect how you see reality\u2026let alone a Rom-com taking place in a world that greatly resembles yours.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s another thing Adorno points out\u2026that in almost every movie, tv show, book, play and many songs\u2026there is always a love interest. There are always two people romantically interested in each other, they work together to beat the bad guy, make out and live happily ever after together. What he says is that this sets people up to think of their life and the figurative movie that is playing out in terms of finding that one and only someone. That the arc of the story of my life is complete when I find that person that I love, they move all their IKEA furniture into my box that I live in and we live the rest of our lives out together isolated in a box. What he says is that this conditions people to think of this individual romantic involvement as the ultimate goal of life\u2026all the while missing out on all the joy and satisfaction that could come by filling that void created by their alienation from other people\u2026in other words, instead of being loved and appreciated by one person\u2026being a loved and appreciated member of a community. People don\u2019t even consider that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee because again\u2026it\u2019s not that there\u2019s an evil group of writers at the top of the culture industry that write what they do SO THAT people stay alienated living in a box happily ever after\u2026it\u2019s that when you\u2019re writing a story\u2026and you want to make the most money\u2026the characters and plots of those stories naturally become characters and plots that the masses can relate to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeople want to be able to easily relate to the characters and immerse themselves in the story. Which then creates this cycle of life imitating art and art imitating life. And because the average worker in this country doesn\u2019t get home from work and put on their Che Guevara beret\u2026you know they\u2019re not a revolutionary constantly looking to be critical of injustices and alternative ways of doing things\u2026no they just wind down from work and passively go along with the life they have\u2026because of that dynamic, the characters in the movies they relate to are going to be generally the same kind of person. The plots of these movies are going to resemble a sort of: stay in your own lane\u2026dont become an antagonist in the movie of your life because the bad guy always loses\u2026when life gives you lemons make lemonade and just enjoy your life as much as you can. This becomes the attitude portrayed by art that life begins to imitate. The culture industry is constantly working to turn everyone into the same person, so that they\u2019ll buy the cultural products that it produces.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s even crazier Adorno and Horkheimer point out\u2026is that all this stuff\u2026is not a mystery to most people. Most people realize at some point in their life that this is going on, that people are just sort of doing their best impression of a conglomeration of different characters they\u2019ve seen on all the movies and TV shows they\u2019ve watched. Just like music and movies all become the same warmed over product with slight differences in detail\u2026people follow the same pattern. They say that in 20th century America:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cpersonality scarcely signifies anything more than shining white teeth and freedom from body odour and emotions. The triumph of advertising in the culture industry is that consumers feel compelled to buy and use its products even though they see through them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy would somebody do that? Why would people that see through what\u2019s going on with the culture industry still choose to participate in the game? Horkheimer would say, because they consider the alternative\u2026what can an average worker REALLY do when it comes to changing it? They\u2019re not gonna run for president. They\u2019re not going to incite revolution. The only change that would come for them if they chose to not participate\u2026is that now they work eight hours a day\u2026and they have NO escape from the exploitation and alienation they face.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is why Adorno has such a vitriol for what The Culture Industry has become. He thinks that when you turn art into a commodity, you instantly hijack it and direct its creation towards mass appeal. But this isn\u2019t what art should be. Works of art have the power to give people a different perspective on things without violence. Works of art have the power to change the world. Theodor Adorno wouldn\u2019t agree with Simone De Beauvoir\u2026that in order to overthrow an oppressive person you need to become an oppressor of that person yourself. What so a group of people oppress another group of people for 200 years\u2026and then what\u2026the oppressed group gets to oppress the other group now? And then this whole cycle just continues over again and again until the end of time? What if true art\u2026not the garbage that the Culture Industry pumps out\u2026but TRUE art. What if that\u2019s the tool for change that is needed the most\u2026 in a world where there is not much of it? We\u2019ll talk about that next time on the Philosophize This! podcast.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_84": {"date": "2017-10-20", "text": "Posted on October 20, 2017\nEpisode 111 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #111 on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo it\u2019s taken me a while to figure out exactly where I want to go with the rest of the Frankfurt School series. You know, distilling the work of one thinker down into a few episodes is impossible enough, when you have a whole group of people it becomes exponentially more difficult\u2026but I think I found a way and I want to start the show today by talking about a Capitalist response to all this\u2026it\u2019s a response that over the years talking to people seems to be a common rebuttal from people who\u00a0hear everything the Frankfurt School has said so far, but still believe that Capitalism is the best way to be doing things. It\u2019s kind of a nuanced way of being a proponent of Capitalism and it goes like this: What if everything the Frankfurt School has said about Capitalism\u2026is true? What if they\u2019re right? What if from birth I have been programmed to think of myself as fundamentally a worker and consumer. I go to a job that sucks the life out of me, I buy things to make me feel better. What if I\u2019m not close to the other human beings around me, what if I\u2019m among the most alienated people that has ever lived? And what IF money is intrinsically connected to political power and what I have is a choice between two people peddling the status quo?\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s use your word, Frankfurt School, let\u2019s say that I\u2019m a member of an\u00a0\u201cexploited\u201d class of people\u2026just like a slave in a slave based economy, just like a peasant in the feudal system, I am exploited. Ok. Well pardon me if I\u2019m nitpicking here\u2026but isn\u2019t it not very useful for you to use the word \u201cexploited\u201d interchangeably there? As though the life of a peasant in the feudal system\u2026and my life in a modern capitalist society\u2026well, exploited\u2026pretty much the same thing. No, you\u2019d have to acknowledge if you\u2019re being intellectually honest that there are huge differences between those two states of affairs.\u00a0In terms of almost every metric you could use to measure it\u2026my life is massively better than the life of a peasant in the 1300\u2019s. It just is.\u00a0You can label us both exploited\u2026but just as a preliminary argument\u2026 I want to point out that things have at least been moving in the right direction since the 1300s\u2026ok, now, consider that positive trajectory, and now ALSO consider for a second the fact, that when Marx looks back at history\u2026 and sees that every economic system that has functioned well for any length of time has this ruling vs. exploited class dynamic about it\u2026maybe there\u2019s a good reason for that!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat as you, the thinkers of the Frankfurt School have aptly pointed out, harnessing control over nature is fundamentally what we\u2019re trying to do when we construct systems using enlightenment style thinking. Look, nobody out there is TOTALLY free. Nobody just does whatever they want to do all the time\u2026to be a human being is necessarily to be repressed in certain ways. We used to be viciously repressed by nature famine, dehydration, disease, extreme cold or heat\u2026that\u2019s what life used to be for us and we got tired of it\u2026that\u2019s why, right around the 17th century we doubled down and got very serious about figuring out a way to control nature and be repressed a little more on our terms. What a coincidence\u2026these people would say\u2026that in the exact same span of time since we started doing this\u2026 there\u2019s been this massive increase in terms of the quality of life of the average person born into a western culture! Harnessing control over nature is what we\u2019re trying to do here\u2026and yes\u2026the volatility of totally unregulated human behavior is as much a part of nature as a hurricane is\u2026and it benefits everyone to protect against it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, these political and economic and ethical systems that we\u2019ve set up over the last few hundred years\u2026have been forged in the fires of controlling nature and along with it, controlling human behavior\u2026and that maybe the ONLY way these systems work well, the reason Marx sees it in every successful economic system in history\u2026is that the recipe for making these systems function requires this regulating influence over people\u2019s behavior. You know, it would be great in a perfect world if we could have a society where everybody just wakes up and does whatever interests them each day, that would be amazing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut what if the only way we can ever experience the benefits of an advanced economic system\u2026is if the average person out there\u2026has a clear role within that economic system that they fall into at birth? What if\u00a0when you take into account certain aspects of individual human psychology, which Marx did not, what if the average person just needs to be coerced into a role that they play or else we run the risk of things being too directionless? Or people not doing anything at all?\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can call filling this role \u201cexploitation\u201d if you want\u2026you can call it \u201crepression\u201d of human freedom, but what if our goal shouldn\u2019t be to remove this exploitation altogether, the system can\u2019t function without it\u2026what if INSTEAD our goal should be to strive to make the life of the average \u201cexploited\u201d person so prosperous, so abundant, so free in terms of the options available to them\u2026that only a maniac would feel like they were actually being exploited. This is what\u00a0Capitalism does and continues to strive towards better than any other system devised in history..and what if limiting your freedom slightly and becoming a worker and consumer is the price of admission for experiencing all the benefits that come along with being a member of an advanced economic system?\n\n\u00a0\n\nSigmund Freud made an argument very similar to this but not just at an economic level\u2026he took it even further to the foundations of civilization itself. He writes about it in his book, \u201cCivilization and its Discontents\u201d and it puts the members of the Frankfurt School in a bit of a precarious situation during their time. On one hand\u2026as you remember: their entire project of critiquing western culture is centered around looking at society through a different lens\u2026 which includes, among other things, Freudian Psychoanalysis. They\u2019re huge fans of Freud. But on the other hand, here\u2019s Freud making a claim that seems to justify domination and control over human behavior as an unavoidable and necessary part of society. Herbert Marcuse, who we talked about on another episode of this series writes what he considers the most important work of his life in response to Freud titled \u201cEros and Civilization\u201d. What I want to do is talk about where Marcuse thinks Freud is coming from with his argument.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to get too hung up on here are all the complex innerworkings of Freudian Psychoanalysis. Not only because it\u2019s been done so many times before\u2026not only because they aren\u2019t necessary to understand Marcuse\u2019s goals in Eros and Civilization, but also just because interpreting Freud\u2019s work is a notoriously complex and polarizing thing to do\u2026I mean there are people out there that practically worship at the guy\u2019s altar\u2026there are other people that think he was so off-base he shouldn\u2019t even be taught in schools. That\u2019s not my determination to make, and I think it just is going to distract from the point of this episode to talk about it\u2026but the good news is, the general point Freud is making is his book Civilization and its Discontents doesn\u2019t require us to understand all the controversy surrounding his work.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe absolute basic point that\u2019s important for us to understand this particular work\u2026is that to Freud\u2026part of being a human being is that we have certain instinctual drives that affect our behavior\u2026sort of like a motor that\u2019s constantly running that makes us want to do certain things\u2026but that in actual reality, nobody ever acts on these instincts 100% of the time\u2026that there\u2019s another part of our psychology that has the ability to step in and say no, I may want to do this right now, but what\u2019s best for me in the long run is to NOT act on this instinct in this moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot that it\u2019s a perfect comparison, because as I said what Freud is talking about is much more complex than this, but because this is a philosophy podcast maybe it would be useful to reference something we\u2019ve seen in ethics since Plato and Aristotle. The idea of reason vs. the passions, right? Some variation of the idea that we have certain passions that drive our feelings about things\u2026you want to eat a gallon of ice cream for dinner\u2026you want to gamble away your life savings\u2026you want to throw a temper tantrum in public and beat somebody with a stick, whatever it is\u2026point is, these passions could take over all of our behavior if we aren\u2019t vigilant\u2026 and that part of being a human being is using this capacity to reason to subordinate the passions. To make a decision not based on what you immediately feel like doing in this moment, but to think ahead, repress those urges to act irresponsibly and ultimately do what\u2019s best for you in the long run.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo many of the thinkers in the early stages of western philosophy\u2026this is what it is to be a human being: we are at our very essence rational animals.\u00a0We have these animalistic, primal desires that we could act on constantly\u2026but the only thing that separates you from all the other animals out there is that you have a choice\u2026 you can use your ability to reason and choose to NOT act on instinct. The wiser of a person you are\u2026the BETTER of a human being you are in many cases to them\u2026is directly connected to your ability to subordinate these passions to your rationality.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow just think about what that\u2019s implying for a second. Somebody that never uses their capacity to reason and just acts on instincts 100% of the time essentially isn\u2019t even granted the status of \u201chuman\u201d. I mean if what we are at our core are rational animals and you take away the rationality part of that equation what are you left with? You\u2019re just an animal. This oversimplification of human psychology and how it works would go on to influence a lot of western philosophers\u2026and don\u2019t forget this sort of rite of passage towards being considered a human being, Marcuse\u2019s going to bring it up later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFreud would ask the question though, what is it that we\u2019re talking about when we reference this ethereal thing we call civilization? I mean, we say it all the time\u2026civilization\u2026but what does it mean to be a human being participating in this game of civilization at all? Freud thinks that what it is at its very foundation\u2026is a group of human beings coming together, a group that\u2019s obviously aware of all the benefits that come along with working in coalition with other people, but they also understand how fragile something like that can be\u2026and so to safeguard against that possibility of societal collapse\u2026 they collectively agree upon a set of cultural rules and norms\u2026 that repress certain instinctual human behaviors that would otherwise be destructive to society as a whole. In other words: what cultural norms and social taboos are when it comes down to it\u2026are the rules a given society puts in place to repress default human behavior for the sake of the benefit to society it provides, for example.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s say you lived out in the middle of the woods by yourself for your entire life\u2026when you get a cold and you have to cough or sneeze\u2026you\u2019d probably just cough or sneeze the same way a walrus at the zoo coughs or sneezes\u2026you\u2019d sneeze with impunity, you know? But when you\u2019re a member of a civilization\u2026you can\u2019t just go down to the grocery store and sneeze in someone\u2019s face\u2026no, we get mad at that person and tell them to cover their mouth\u2026and why do we do that? Because it benefits society as a whole to not have a bunch of germs and disease flying around.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s say you were a bear living next to Yellowstone National Park\u2026and for your whole life you never really needed to hunt for food, whenever you were hungry you could go down to the trashcans and eat whatever the humans left behind that day. You\u2019re probably not going to get much resistance from your bear compadres for taking advantage of this resource that\u2019s available to you. But on the other hand if you\u2019re a member of a civilization taking advantage of all the benefits\u2026and you\u2019re a 47 year old man that lives in your sister\u2019s basement that has never worked a day in his life\u2026cultural norms label you as a pariah because we need people being productive and participating for society to continue functioning well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are endless examples of this as you can imagine\u2026and the point Freud is making here: is that the structure of civilization becomes a direct mirror of what is going on within individual human psychology. That in the same way I may want to eat a gallon of ice cream for dinner every night, but this other aspect of my psychology steps in and governs that drive for the good of my long term survival\u2026so too there are instinctual ways human beings could behave that would be detrimental to society, so we erect these rules and taboos to repress human behavior and keep society functioning well. The bigger point Freud wants to make here is that this is not just some coincidence\u2026this is WHAT a civilization is. The very concept of civilization REQUIRES the repression of unregulated human behavior. The price of admission for experiencing all the benefits of civilization is to play by the rules of certain cultural norms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse would mostly agree with all this. He would agree that civilizations, especially in the past, have required a certain amount of repression to be able to function well\u2026the question we should be asking ourselves is how much of this repression is necessary? Also, is all repression just garden variety repression\u2026no distinction when it comes to the severity of it\u2026it\u2019s just a necessary part of civilization? See the thing Marcuse points out about cultural norms\u2026is that there\u2019s no grand arbiter that oversees where these rules begin and end. These cultural norms that we live by just sort of emerge historically\u2026the same way it is today\u2026what made something culturally taboo back in the 1700\u2019s was only dictated by whether it helped society function well, not necessarily what\u2019s ethical. So what naturally follows from that\u2026is that if the society you\u2019re a part of in the 1700\u2019s is an agricultural slave based culture\u2026there\u2019s not going to be a social taboo for being someone that owns slaves\u2026nobody\u2019s going to get mad at you for owning slaves like they get mad at the person that sneezes in their face\u2026no, on the contrary\u2026the ownership of slaves is part of what allows the economy to function well in that society. Marcuse would ask: do you think there\u2019s anything that allows our economy to function well that is equally as unethical?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause just because it wasn\u2019t a cultural taboo at the time, does that make slavery okay? No. Was slavery ever ok despite the fact there was a time when nobody thought anything of it? No. The thing Marcuse would want us to ask ourselves\u2026is how many of the cultural norms that you\u2019re participating in today\u2026 in 200 years are going to be seen as equally barbaric\u2026because here\u2019s the thing: you\u2019re currently participating in a LOT of them. No matter how ethical or socially progressive you think you are\u2026the fact is everything about the way that you think about things COMES from this culture that you\u2019re a part of or the cultures you have access to. That you can\u2019t HELP but be an instantiation of the culture you were born into\u2026and that even if you are totally against EVERYTHING your culture stands for\u2026who you are is still defined by your opposition to\u2026that culture. This is bordering on an idea that was pretty popular among thinkers in the mid 20th century called structuralism, and we\u2019re going to be talking about it soon on this show.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Marcuse points out\u2026is that because there is no grand arbiter determining cultural norms\u2026and that because cultural norms and enlightenment style thinking by their very nature are in the business of repressing human freedom and behavior\u2026yes for the benefit of society, but still in that business\u2026it becomes incredibly easy to wake up in a society that engages in things like slavery, but never thinks twice about them because they\u2019re culturally accepted. More than that\u2026again, because there\u2019s no arbiter of these things\u2026it\u2019s easy to find yourself living in a society that represses things that people want to do\u2026that 200 years ago, certainly benefitted society\u2026but only serve to needlessly repress people in today\u2019s world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee the Frankfurt School is not saying that we should do away with cultural norms or do away with Enlightenment style thinking just because they aim to control nature and human behavior. No, the lives we live are without question way better than the peasant in the Feudal system mostly BECAUSE of enlightenment style thinking, we can\u2019t get rid of that. What they\u2019re calling for is us to be more self aware of the natural destination we arrive at when we use reason to harness control over nature: the repression of human freedom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019ve called enlightenment style thinking so far the Frankfurt School calls Traditional Theory. The maxim that everyone in academia repeats ad naseum is that traditional theory aims to understand and control\u2026critical theory aims to liberate. What they mean is Traditional Theory is the type of thinking we\u2019re doing when we harness control over nature\u2026now because we know that that\u2019s naturally going to lead to the repression of human freedom\u2026to safeguard against what has happened time and time again all throughout history, we need to have some different kind of theory thats sole purpose is to identify this repression that naturally occurs\u2026and catch it before it turns into something like slavery. They call this theory: critical theory. In other words: Traditional theory aims to understand and control, that\u2019s a good thing\u2026Critical theory aims to liberate people from the necessary effects of us controlling nature and making the world a better place.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo again, Marcuse acknowledges that a certain amount of repression of freedom is necessary for a society to function properly\u2026the question is: how much repression is too much, and is it wise to have certain major pieces of a society like its economy FOUNDED on extreme repression to the point it doesn\u2019t function without it? Marcuse thinks the only way to determine what repression is necessary\u2026and what repression is just historical baggage we\u2019re carrying around from a bygone age, is we have to constantly reevaluate our cultural norms and figure out which ones are still helping us, and which ones just repress people for no reason.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse writes this book in the 1950\u2019s United States. One example of a cultural taboo he thinks is outdated and only serves to repress people is the way that our culture viewed sexuality back then. He\u2019d probably start by saying: look back at the history of the world\u2026what is a cultural taboo that exists pretty ubiquitously across most cultures in the history of civilization? Generally speaking\u2026it is not okay for you to have indiscriminate, wanton sex with whoever you want all the time. That\u2019s pretty much across the board with few exceptions\u2026now why do people typically have this rule? Well, historically speaking: monogamous, stable relationships benefit society when we\u2019re not in a tribal setting. When society is structured in a way where it\u2019s one family, under one roof, raising children together\u2026generally speaking a bunch of people going around having babies with people they have no intention of raising the child with is a recipe for disaster.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is an example of one of those areas where human instinct needs to be repressed for the sake of society functioning well. Now, keep in mind\u2026it\u2019s not like people can just easily flip the switch and turn instincts off\u2026this repression goes on within the minds of people and often causes a lot of inner turmoil. Just think about that: all throughout history, we\u2019ve had people that have had these instinctual desires of wanting to be more promiscuous, and the culture\u2019s that they were born into have told them\u2026 that they are wrong for having those feelings. That BAD people have those feelings. Sub-human, flawed people have those feelings in some cases. Not only should you be ASHAMED for having these feelings\u2026but you\u2019re not gonna talk about it\u2026and you need to live every day of your life pretending as though these thoughts aren\u2019t going on inside of your head. I mean, just think about that\u2026BILLIONS of people throughout history for their entire lives feeling guilty about some urge that they can\u2019t control.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Marcuse would say: historically speaking\u2026this cultural taboo has helped us tremendously. The question we have to ask ourselves is: is it STILL helping us in 1955 in the United States? Marcuse would say, no. It doesn\u2019t. The reality of the world that we live in now, is that technology has advanced to the point to produce many different kinds of birth control that make having a baby with someone practically impossible. In other words: advancements in technology have produced essentially a different world\u2026it\u2019s a world where heterosexuals don\u2019t need to repress this part of themselves and live these lives of quiet desperation anymore. Unfortunately for others it would take more than technology for culture to legitimize their internal clash with the social norms of the time they\u2019re living\u2026Foucault\u2019s coming, but this is a great example of critical theory in action: here\u2019s a cultural taboo that was put in place at one point in time when it helped society\u2026 that in the 1950\u2019s United States was leading to a lot of needless repression. Look to the sexual liberation movement of the 1960\u2019s to see the direct effects of this\u2026and this is just one example:\u00a0Marcuse would say that we have a moral obligation to constantly scrutinize these cultural norms or else we run the risk of living in a much more repressive society than we need to be.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow maybe you can see where Marcuse\u2019s going with this. So if technology has produced a world where people no longer need to be as puritanical when it comes to their sexuality, what\u2019s another area technology has allowed for people to not need to be needlessly repressed? You know, a common response I\u2019ve gotten to the last few episodes is, well maybe we are workers and consumers\u2026but we don\u2019t seem too far away from some sort of technological singularity where AIs and machines just do all the work for us, while the life of the average person is to stay at home, receive some sort universal basic income and take advantage of all their new free time. Marcuse would respond to that and say, hey\u2026that\u2019s a GREAT idea! Let\u2019s do it now! Let\u2019s do it. We COULD do it right now\u2026I mean, if we were willing to take our foot off the gas of hyper technological progress and efficiency, we could have a world where 99.9% of the work is done by machines. Why don\u2019t we do it, though?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse says that throughout history it has been necessary for people to work to be able to sustain a living. The reality was that if everyone DIDN\u2019T put in 40, 50, 60 hours a week, society would cease to produce what was necessary for everyone to survive. But that\u2019s not the world we live in anymore\u2026industry and technology have produced machines\u2026that theoretically if everybody wanted to tomorrow\u2026could produce all that we need to survive and people wouldn\u2019t have to work. See it used to be that we go to work to provide the things we need\u2026now we go to work to buy things that we\u2019re told we need. I gotta work the overtime shift so I can buy that car so that the girl on the commercial will like me and I can start that family and not be so empty inside. I need to go to work so I can make the payments on that phone so that I too can become the type of person on the commercial that uses the 8000 megapixel camera to take pictures of those close friends I don\u2019t have. This manufacturing of false needs is designed to keep people going back to work for forty hours a week chasing a ghost.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee Marcuse would hear the capitalist argument at the beginning of the episode and say, ok\u2026let\u2019s say that repression is necessary for society to function. Let\u2019s say that to experience the benefits of an advanced economic society, people need to fall into this role of worker and consumer at birth. Again, some repression may be necessary\u2026the question is: how much repression is necessary? In this case: how much work is necessary before they\u2019ve earned the right to the benefits of Capitalism? How much work? Is it 40 hours a week? Where did that number come from? Why not 39 hours a week\u2026is that enough? Why not five hours a week? Like if you went down to the factory and talked to the person breaking their back doing 40 hours of manual labor, would they say something like\u2026oh yeah, I know we could be having machines doing all of this and that I could have a lot more free time\u2026but I\u2019m personally just a HUGE fan of hyper technological progress, so I\u2019m willing to sacrifice my body to see what\u2019s coming up! That\u2019s no where even NEAR how they think about their job. When was the last time a political candidate ran on the platform of: I\u2019m going to slow down the rate of growth of our economy so that the average person can be happier! You mean you\u2019re not going to GROW the economy? You\u2019d be laughed out of the primaries effectively silencing this political alternative even if possibly it might be better for people, this whole process not unlike, Marcuse would say, a Totalitarian society.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou know as I touched on before\u2026when Marcuse says that we live in what greatly resembles a Totalitarian society\u2026it\u2019s really easy to write him off as being dramatic because I know what a REAL totalitarian society looks like. North Korea\u2026that\u2019s Totalitarian. 1930s Germany\u2026that\u2019s Totalitarian. Marcuse would say, absolutely\u2026you are NOT living under a North Korean style of Totalitarianism. Because at least in that society a military coup and a public uprising has a shot. What you\u2019re living under is the most insidious, self-perpetuating, genius totalitarianism that has ever existed. For all intents and purposes\u2026you don\u2019t live in a capitalist system as described by Adam Smith in the wealth of nations, I mean it loosely resembles it. You don\u2019t live in the same kind of society that Marx offered criticisms of in the 1800s. Capitalism in the west has turned into what may as well be a completely different economic system\u2026one where any voice of opposition to the way that things currently are becomes coopted by the system and used as a money making endeavor that keeps things going. Where even the books that directly criticize Capitalism with the faces of Marx and Engels on the cover become just mere products that are vetted and endorsed by the Capitalist system in the eyes of the consumer. Where even the most revolutionary person among us who hates the way that things are\u2026buys all those books on Marxism, memorizes the arguments, forced to continue going to their job everyday in a constant state of self-loathing, looking around them at the naive people that just buy products like cars and trucks to make themselves feel just good enough to go back to work again the next day\u2026that even to that person\u2026those books are the products that they buy that pacify them. Buying those books allows them to FEEL as though they\u2019re counter-culture and revolutionary\u2026appeasing them just enough to go back to their job the next day feeling intellectually superior, not ever doing anything about it.\u00a0We\u2019re not living in the age of Capitalism anymore\u2026we\u2019re living in the age of Monopoly Capitalism. Marcuse thinks there\u2019s a way out. We\u2019ll talk about it next time on the show.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_85": {"date": "2017-11-6", "text": "Posted on November 6, 2017\nEpisode 112 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #112 on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume for a second that Marcuse\u2019s right. That in a country where many of the citizens see freedom as the fundamental thing the United States embodies\u2026 in reality, the population\u2019s actually living under an advanced version of monopoly capitalism, that has sort of\u00a0metastasized and taken control of everything from art, to politics, to government, all of this amounting to what\u2019s probably the most clever, insidious totalitarian system in history. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re living in that\u2026how would you know that you were living in it? What sort of clues would you see around you if you did\u2026would you even notice them? Or would you frame who you are so much in relation to that totalitarian system, that nothing would ever seem out of the ordinary to you?\n\nHerbert Marcuse would probably say that if you want to figure out the answers to these questions\u2026maybe it would be useful to put yourself in the shoes of a member of an overtly totalitarian society to see what\u2019s similar.\u00a0Let\u2019s say 1930\u2019s Nazi Germany for the sake of the example\u2026what would it be like to be a citizen living under the Third Reich? Well one things for sure if you\u2019re the government\u2026for any of this Third Reich business to be going on for any length of time\u2026one thing you\u2019re going to need is approval from the population to continue doing the things you\u2019re doing. Now in totalitarian societies\u2026this is typically done by having some sort of propaganda machine in place that gets people thinking about their lives and their country\u2019s place in the world in a distorted way\u2026often times it gives them a piece of reality, a version of it\u2026but it obscures other things so that they never get the full picture.\n\nSee that\u2019s the thing about propaganda\u2026there\u2019s layers of nuance to it. Like, no one in 1930\u2019s Germany was tied to a chair with a belt and forced to watch 1000 episodes of Sponge Bob Squarepants and then they came out the other side worshipping Hitler. No propaganda wouldn\u2019t work if it was that obvious it was being administered. Part of the art, of propaganda\u2026 is getting people to believe that they arrived at this set of conclusions all by themselves. When you look at different examples of the great propaganda campaigns throughout history\u2026you start to see certain tactics being used over and over again because they\u2019re just so effective at shaping the way that people see the world.\n\nFear\u2026is an effective tactic. Appealing to people\u2019s tribal tendencies is effective\u2026us vs. them thinking\u2026Manufacturing false news stories or events that fit a particular narrative. Manipulating the way that a story is delivered, blowing certain details out of proportion that tells the story you want it to tell. These have been used time and time again, and in 1930\u2019s Germany there was a handful of people whose job it was to use these tactics to ensure that the average German citizen remained a good foot soldier\u2026had a view of Germany and the rest of the world that made them behave the way a GOOD German behaves. That was the goal of propaganda.\n\nMarcuse would ask: when you take a look at the culture industry\u2026 and the role it plays in shaping the way that people see themselves and the world\u2026by the way, the delivery system for most people on the American way of life\u2026life imitates art\u2026where selfless hard work is one of the most admired qualities, where every day is a transaction between work time and consumption time, where people chase the American dream which is defined by your relationship to materialistic stuff, two cars a house and a white picket fence\u2026a fence that in a really aesthetically pleasing way keeps out other human beings, so that you can sit in your box being entertained in isolation\u2026do you think it\u2019s possible, Marcuse would ask, that the culture industry keeps people thinking in a narrow American capitalistic sort of way that keeps things moving forward, the same way Nazi Propaganda kept German citizens thinking in a narrow way that kept THEIR interests moving forward?\n\nSee because again, and I\u2019m talking to you America, let\u2019s say that we\u2019re all these citizens immersed in a totalitarian society\u2026what is the propaganda that gets fed to us every day? Where do most people get their views on what\u2019s going on in the world and their place within it? Maybe you watch the news. Maybe you read a news paper\u2026maybe it\u2019s the radio or podcasts or a blog\u2026regardless, the point is to Marcuse: they\u2019re all products\u2026products that are created to correspond with existing consumer demand. The news is not broadcasted by some diety or some philosopher king that just wants to deliver an objective view of what\u2019s going on out there\u2026no, the news is delivered the way it is\u2026because it most effectively gets the eyeballs of the average American to come back the next day and watch commercials\u2026which is not necessarily in ANY way connected to what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm and design a product that delivers people the news\u2026what kind of product is going to be profitable? What\u2019s gonna make the average American worker tune in the next day? Well like we talked about on the culture industry episode\u2026when your life from the cradle to the grave is to go to a job eight hours a day that sucks the life out of you\u2026and then go home and consume products to feel better\u2026understandably\u2026the average American is not going to want to go home and do a grueling study of quantum mechanics in their free time\u2026no, they\u2019re going to want something easy to consume that entertains them. Well, so too\u2026with where they get their news! That if you were creating a product that delivers the average person the news\u2026one of the worst things you could do is to make a show that gets people to constantly challenge their beliefs\u2026gets them to think about the assumptions they may have been making for decades, that\u2019s a lot of thinking\u2026that\u2019s hard work. You wouldn\u2019t want to make a show that goes into a really deep nuanced, for most people boring, investigation of any of these highly complex topics the news passes off as simple\u2026\u00a0no, that would be exhausting to listen to for most people. What most Americans want after an exhausting day at work is not to put in even more work in improving themselves. They want something easy. They want a product that tells them, you\u2019re right. No more work to do here, you\u2019ve got the world ALL figured out\u2026and just like many propaganda campaigns throughout history this product then delivers to them a simplified, distorted view of reality that reinforces this world picture. Marcuse would say: that it\u2019s not a coincidence these products created to deliver the news often times use the same sort of tactics to get people to tune in that have been used in propaganda campaigns throughout history!\n\nWe can go right down the line of the examples we gave: Fear. This just in! There have been 16 mountain lion attacks in your area in the last two weeks. Now, in the mind of the consumer: OMG, THANK YOU! Where would I be if I didn\u2019t watch this news segment that told me of this imminent danger in my life? I\u2019ll tell you where I\u2019d be I\u2019d be passing through the small intestine of a mountain lion right about now! I need to tune in tomorrow to learn about the NEXT thing I need to be scared of! Appealing to tribal tendencies: back in the 1930\u2019s it was\u2026here\u2019s this group of people that\u2019s responsible for most of the ills of society! If only we could find a way to get rid of them things would be great! Turn on your news station today and they\u2019ll give you a tribe and talk about how the other party is responsible for all the bad in the world. Manufacturing false news stories\u2026do I even need to expand on that one? Manipulating headlines and phrasing using words that they know will trigger a certain negative or positive response from people\u2026this is being done, right out in the open. To Marcuse, these are products being sold to people that are designed to validate a limited world view\u2026that scratch the itch of feeling politically involved, but never require people to do the actual work of challenging their beliefs on things and understanding the world at a deeper level.\n\nIn other words, the culture industry serves the same purpose as a propaganda machine in a totalitarian society\u2026but there\u2019s no evil cabal of fascists at the top that are pulling the puppet strings of this one. No, the people that produce the products in the culture industry aren\u2019t evil\u2026in reality\u2026they\u2019re just trying to keep the lights on like everybody else. They\u2019re just trying to create a product\u2026that turns a profit and keeps them in business\u2026what can you do if this is just the type of programming that the average person wants?\n\nSo, what\u2019s another example of a clue we might see around us if we were really living in a covert totalitarian society?\u00a0You know, a common misconception of the Frankfurt School and many Neo-Marxists for that matter is that they are all big government types\u2026that they want to bring about a world where the government has an inordinate amount of control over the life of the average person. On the contrary\u2026there are sections of the Frankfurt School\u2019s work that almost sound like a neo-conservative critique of FDR\u2019s new deal. You want to talk about clues that are all around you\u2026they would say it is not a coincidence that there has been such a massive increase in the size and scope of the Federal Government over the years. That people in capitalist societies are often educated to think about the public and private sectors as two things that are divorced, separate and regulating each other. That may be somewhat true in a traditional capitalist society, but in a monopoly capitalist society they\u2019re just two arms on the giant leviathan of capitalism that controls everything. Giant bailouts and government programs that artificially prop up the weaknesses of a capitalist system that should have failed long ago. So what happens is: instead of having a national discussion about the boom and crash nature of capitalism and the suffering it causes\u2026we just accept it as the norm\u2026it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019re in a down period\u2026then use massive government encroachment into people\u2019s lives to save ourselves\u2026in the case of FDR, hey everybody\u2019s got a job now! You\u2019re all working for the government\u2026forget your own personal freedom and individuality\u2026we\u2019re in an economic depression right now\u2026times are tough! You need to fall in line, be THANKFUL for the job we give you and become a cog in a machine. Does that sound at all familiar to other forms of totalitarianism?\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of ways the Frankfurt School thinks the government props up capitalism from failing: Not that they think welfare checks are something to be abolished, but they would say that an unintended consequence of having them available to people is that it sort of sweeps under the rug another failure of capitalism. That Capitalism produces sick, alienated people. People get depressed. People get addicted to substances to cope with feeling bad. People develop mental illness. That if Capitalism just naturally ran its course\u2026people would be dying and starving to death\u2026we\u2019d have bodies in the streets\u2026and maybe if we had bodies in the streets people would be outraged and we\u2019d have to contend with just how many of the problems we have are direct results of our economic system. Instead, we give people a check, keep them alive just dead inside\u2026give them some pills and say you\u2019re gonna start feeling better soon, the important thing now is let\u2019s get you off the dole and get you back to working and buying stuff! That\u2019s the important thing!\n\nMarcuse would want us to consider: if you could go back in time and talk to a citizen of germany under the government of the Third Reich\u2026these people weren\u2019t just mindless robots blabbering on\u2026if you asked them why Adolf Hitler was the best thing for them and the future of the world, they would have arguments primed and ready that they believe they arrived at on their own\u2026talking points marinated into them over years of propaganda. Many of which designed to undercut a more nuanced conversation before it even begins. Marcuse would ask: is it possible that a lot of Americans are not too different from this just with different talking points that justify capitalism and undercut a deeper conversation?\n\nNow in this next section I don\u2019t want this to seem like I\u2019m offering up a strawman argument on the Capitalist side and am making that the response to the Frankfurt School. There are many more great Capitalist responses to come on this show. But that said, in keeping with the thought experiment today that Americans are citizens of a totalitarian society\u2026if the problem in America is one of class consciousness as the Frankfurt School says\u2026then in that world, the argument the average person is going to give for why Capitalism is good and Marxism is bad\u2026is not going to be some deep, complex argument that\u2019s come from years of thoroughly educating themselves\u2026it\u2019s going to be a weak argument they\u2019ve picked up over the years from these products they consume every day that give them the illusion of having a deep understanding of the world.\n\nAnd just like in 1930\u2019s Germany\u2026 where many of the talking points aimed to end a more nuanced conversation before it even began\u2026Marcuse would say there\u2019s a type of person in America who just dismisses all of Marxism and parrots some variation of, Marx\u2026Neo-Marxists\u2026post-Marxists\u2026all of those Marxists types\u2026their problem is that they just don\u2019t understand THIS thing about the way that the world works\u2026or THAT thing about how human beings are\u2026if they just understood this thing like I do\u2026then they\u2019d realize that their entire lives were wasted trying to rescue Marx from faulty premises. Have I read any of these people\u2026no. There\u2019s no point in me reading and arriving at a deep understanding of their work\u2026Marxism ruins any chance they have of being legitimate before I even open the book.\n\nMarcuse would ask this person: what do you think is more likely? That 100\u2019s of Marxist thinkers that have come since Marx did his work, many of them critical of Marx, some savagely critical, that spent their entire lives reading and interpreting these ideas\u2026Do you think it\u2019s more likely Marcuse would ask that they have all missed out on this nugget of wisdom that you have that instantly destroys Marxism, or that maybe it\u2019s more complex than that. That maybe your unwillingness to do the work of doing a deep reading and truly understanding is the reason you haven\u2019t heard the argument against that talking point\u2026and that the reality is much more exciting than that\u2026there\u2019s actually a deeper, more interesting discourse being had between Capitalists and Marxists that you could potentially enjoy?\n\nLet\u2019s look at a common example of one of these and how Marcuse would respond in Eros and Civilization. The problem with Marxism\u2026and any society structured around Marxism\u2026is that it just doesn\u2019t understand human nature. That we, just by our nature as human beings, take the path of least resistance. We\u2019re as lazy as we\u2019re allowed to be. This goes down to the very roots of our instinct to survive. For example, if you needed water to stay alive\u2026and there\u2019s a stream five feet away from you and another one 500 miles away from you\u2026which stream are you going to get your water from? Of course the one five feet away. Sure, it would be great if we could have a society where everyone\u2019s basic needs are taken care of and people just did what interested them\u2026but it doesn\u2019t matter how much window dressing you put on Marxism: ultimately we\u2019re dealing with human beings here\u2026and when people are given the choice to work or not to work. It\u2019s just a matter of time until people stop working, don\u2019t do anything and just take advantage of the people around them that ARE working.\n\nMarcuse would want to call into question the premise that human nature is as simple as just \u201ctaking the path of least resistance.\u201d He\u2019d probably start by giving an example of how people often DON\u2019T take the path of least resistance. Maybe he\u2019d bring up someone like a Steve Jobs or an Elon Musk. These are people that very clearly aren\u2019t doing just the bare minimum required to survive and then sitting around all day. These are people that are very clearly not putting in all the hours they\u2019re putting in for the sake of money. These aren\u2019t people that are extrinsically motivated by money, they\u2019re people intrinsically motivated by a creative vision they have for changing the world for the better. So if it really is just human nature to take the path of least resistance, why do people like this exist?\n\nAnd the person may respond to Marcuse..well those guys are the exceptions to the rule. These guys are the outliers on the Bell Curve\u2026but let\u2019s not forget about the rest of the Bell Curve. For every one Steve Jobs you have you\u2019re going to get 10,000 people that want to laze about all day doing nothing taking advantage of the work Steve Jobs is putting in.\n\nMarcuse might respond by saying: well why does this psychology exist in larger numbers just not by people as powerful as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk? What I mean is: what about everyone smiling and awkwardly high fiving on Shark Tank every week? I mean, there are a lot of people out there right now hustling and grinding trying to bring a new product to market, or make it as a musician, or start their own landscaping business or whatever it is and they\u2019re doing these things not because they want to make tons of money but because they have a creative vision that they\u2019re passionate about? I mean, some people DO create only for the money\u2026and even if you\u2019re not the money certainly needs to come in and Marcuse\u2019s not calling into question the ability of money to motivate people\u2026what he\u2019s countering is the extreme claim that it is part of the nature of human beings to take the path of least resistance. Why do we have so many people resembling Steve Jobs and Elon Musk expending so much energy to create something they\u2019re passionate about\u2026why do we have so many people beyond that\u2026where even if they aren\u2019t actively hustling to create something right now\u2026can relate to this part of their psychology\u2026have at some point in their life tried something like this and just failed?\n\nWhat Marcuse\u2019s going to reference in Eros and Civilization is a concept from Freudian Psychology commonly referred to as the Dual Instinct Theory. For a lot of Freud\u2019s work, he heavily emphasizes the impact that libido has on what drives our behavior, even if it\u2019s just at an unconscious level. But in the beginning of his 1920 book Beyond the Pleasure Principle he recounts working with soldiers from WW1 that seem to be suffering from what we would call today Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They have recurring dreams and thoughts reenacting how close they came to death. He works with children who lost a parent and continuously, almost impulsively throw a toy and then retrieve it over and over again simulating the loss of their parent. What Freud theorizes is that human behavior is not as simple as just a drive towards life and a removal of tension, that we all exist in our psychology in a constant, irreconciliable conflict between two drives: Eros, which you may recognize as the Greek god of sexual desire or attraction\u2026and Thanatos, the figure in Greek mythology that represented death.\n\nNow Eros may be the god of sexual desire and attraction, but to Marcuse it goes much deeper than that\u2026that the desire to sexually reproduce with someone is at its core an act of creation\u2026and this drive of Eros extends to, and is the part of our psychology that\u2019s responsible for, why we have a drive to produce all other forms of creation. In other words, the same drive that is responsible for the frequent desire you feel to have a baby with someone you\u2019re attracted to\u2026is the same part of your psychology that makes you want to create OTHER close bonds with people\u2026to put in the work to create deep friendships, to put in the work to create a family life in your home that is close and loving, to put in the work of creating a close community\u2026that\u2019s not all though\u2026it\u2019s also the part of your psychology that makes you want to create, a great symphony that lives on after your death, or create a company that you pass down over generations, or start a blog that\u2019s impact lives on long after you die. This drive of Eros is a fixation we all have on life, survival and creation both on an individual level AND a societal level\u2026Thanatos is a fixation we all have on death, at an individual and societal level. To Freud, the two of these are in constant conflict and are irreconcilable. Marcuse doesn\u2019t agree\u2026he thinks one thing Freud failed to consider is that Eros and Thanatos are always developed in the mind of the individual within a particular social framework\u2026a social framework that has a huge effect on how we see ourselves and what we desire to do as people\u2026and that the battle between these two drives is actually something that has been created historically by us for the benefit of society.\n\nLet\u2019s explain that further\u2026building on what we talked about last episode: throughout history\u2026the repression of certain human instincts has been necessary for civilization to function well. Throughout history, we\u2019ve always needed people 8, 9, 10 hours a day working just to be able to produce the bare minimum required for most people to have food, water, shelter and other basic needs. Another way of putting that\u2026is that throughout history\u2026all of the creative drives that people had in the realm of Eros, needed to be repressed for the sake of the world continuing.\n\nLook, when we need people working 10 hours a day just to be able to persist as a species, we don\u2019t have time for people to spend all day being some kind of sexual explorer like they\u2019re Vasco Da Gama. We don\u2019t have time for you to spend hours and hours every day connecting with people, creating tons of super close friends, spending 14 hours a day with your family just because you enjoy it. We don\u2019t have time for you to sit around and write a symphony or create some blog that interests you\u2026we got work to do\u2026and it doesn\u2019t matter how often you have that desire towards creation and life\u2026you need to push it down\u2026repress it\u2026and fall into your role within the economic system of your time. This benefitted us tremendously throughout history.\n\nWell in today\u2019s world\u2026we\u2019re still doing it. For our society to keep moving at the rate it\u2019s moving we need the majority of people to go to work 8 hours a day\u2026all the while from birth told to be reasonable, get a real job and push down and repress that drive of Eros that\u2019s gonna take up too much of your time. Marcuse would ask: why are we doing this? The argument we talked about last time was that we need to repress certain human instincts and freedom for the sake of the benefit it provides to society. Well in the past the benefit has been clear: we are repressing the Eros of people so that we can provide the bare necessities of living. What benefit are we getting from repressing that today? A hedonic treadmill of products that satisfy false needs? The ability to get the next plasma TV? To get the next car in a more efficient manner than it would otherwise get created? Marcuse would ask about the United States in particular: What? The ability to buy stuff\u2026throw it away two months later where it ends up in the ocean\u2026and then continue to suck the earth dry of resources? Colonize the globe with hundreds of military bases so we can make sure we have control over those resources when we need them to continue this process?\n\nTo the person that makes the claim that it is just human nature to take the path of least resistance\u2026 and that when given the choice to work or to sit around and just consume all the time, people are often going to sit around, do nothing and consume\u2026 Marcuse would ask: how much do you think that\u2019s affected by the fact that people are conditioned from birth to think of themselves in terms of work mode vs consumption mode? How much do you think people are affected by the fact, that before they even enter the workforce\u2026whenever that Eros voice in their head starts speaking they\u2019re told to silence it and repress it because we just NEED workers\u2026we NEED workers to continue this capitalist vision? In other words, how much are we programming into people\u2019s heads this forced work vs consumption dichotomy that you call a part of human nature?\n\nLike if you gave the average worker in the United States $100 million dollars and said you no longer need to work anymore. Do whatever you want. You\u2019re free! Let\u2019s say they won the lottery. Marcuse wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the average person probably wouldn\u2019t take that $100 million dollars and do things with it like they\u2019re Elon Musk\u2026no, every day of their life up until that point has been framed in terms of I work when I have to work\u2026and when I\u2019m not working\u2026I\u2019m consuming as much as I can to recharge my batteries because I know in the back of my mind have to go back to work the next day. These are my two modes: work and consume. Marcuse wouldn\u2019t be shocked that if they\u2019re given $100 million and don\u2019t need to work anymore\u2026they would go into consumption mode\u2026buy a bunch of cars they don\u2019t need, clothes they don\u2019t need, give their brother 80 grand to open his vape store\u2026in other words, they\u2019re gonna do what they did any other time they didn\u2019t have to work in a capitalist society\u2026sit around, do nothing productive and consume stuff until the money\u2019s gone and they have to work again. But is this human nature? Or historical conditioning to keep Capitalism going?\n\nMarcuse would say maybe the reason there\u2019s such a difference between what Elon Musk feels like doing with $100 million dollars and what the average person feels like doing with it comes down to the level of repression society has required for them to place on that desire to create in their Eros. What would the average person be like if instead of repressing Eros from birth\u2026we nurtured it and tried to develop it? Not that everyone would be Elon Musk, far from it, but you\u2019d have to acknowledge that this repression has a real effect on how often this muscle of creativity is used in the average person. We all know the people that if they were given $100 million dollars and someone asked them what sort of creative desires do you have? What\u2019s your Eros? What needs to be said that isn\u2019t being said, what do you want to bring into existence with this money? And they respond with\u2026nothing. Nothing really interests me\u2026don\u2019t really care about creating anything. How much of that can be explained by them silencing that voice inside of them every time its spoken up throughout their life? It\u2019s a muscle that\u2019s atrophied for the sake of an economic role they play, not a lazy consumption mode that is imbued into human nature.\n\nWhat would happen if we didn\u2019t ground our society in this repression of these creative drives just so that we can keep making plasma TVs? What if it wasn\u2019t about efficiency at all costs anymore? What if we had a simulation\u2026 picture a simulated world where we could change certain elements about society and watch it play out\u2026instead of 40 hours a week, we slowly dial back the work week to a point where machines did the majority of the work, people only had to work two hours a week and spent the rest of the time doing what they want and exploring this Eros part of their psychology. What would that society look like? What would the average person BE like?\n\nNow, there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re doing this in a simulation and not in the real world. Like if you\u2019re rolling your eyes at this\u2026Really Marcuse? oh boy! the whole world\u2019s gonna go home early from work on friday and write symphonies together! Do some finger painting. That\u2019s what you think people are going to do with their free time?\n\nMarcuse fully realized that the solution is not as simple as us just dialing back the number of hours people work and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re free!\u201d \u201cCheck out that Eros thing I was talking about if you get a chance!\u201d Like we talked about in another episode\u2026Marcuse says that you never just implement by force some sort of sweeping change like this\u2026that everything about the way an average worker views themselves is in terms of being a worker and consumer. The absolute worst thing you could ever do is throw out Capitalism today and implement Marxism tomorrow. He\u2019s actually highly critical of people that try to force a Marxist revolution\u2026 in a country that\u2019s not currently in a state of revolution or pre-revolution. To him, that\u2019s one of the big mistakes Marxist revolutions have made in the past. You can\u2019t just take people that have repressed this Eros their entire life\u2026 and expect them to be able to do some sort of psychological about-face just because you\u2019ve given them a new economic role to play.\n\nMarcuse\u2019s not saying that we should all work as little as possible and spend more time doing arts and crafts with friends and the world\u2019s going to fix itself. No, it\u2019s more that, here\u2019s an interesting point: Here\u2019s an entire part of our psychology as human beings that all throughout history we\u2019ve had to repress for the sake of survival that we no longer NECESSARILY need to repress. What would the world look like if we didn\u2019t? How much suffering is being caused world wide every second that we don\u2019t? Are there particular genders and races that have been historically repressed for the sake of society more than others? Marcuse asks us to consider a lot of questions. Should we ignore the negative effects Capitalism has on the mental health of people through its tendency to alienate? Should we ignore the negative effects it has on the planet with its over production and waste that just ends up at a landfill? Should we ignore how the culture industry naturally serves up products that keep people ignorant and complacent about their views on things? Here\u2019s the most important question to Marcuse: Do we have a moral imperative to stand against the systems that dominate and repress people to keep Capitalism going on the backs of billions of people suffering? This is why Marcuse titles another one of his books One Dimensional Man: this advanced, totalitarian capitalist structure is maintaining a one-dimensional society\u2026one that \u201cconforms to existing thought and behavior and lacks a critical dimension and a dimension of potentialities that transcend the existing society.\u201d\n\nSee because if we were all in a totalitarian society right now and everybody wanted to get out\u2026Marcuse would say the way out of it is never going to be a revolution by way of force\u2026it\u2019s most likely gonna come slowly over the course of generations through a shifting of class consciousness. This shift, to Marcuse, is only going to happen if the citizens, as individuals, look in the mirror, become self aware of their participation in the way that things are and makes a resolution towards an extreme type of radical subjectivity against the current system that represses people. He calls this resolution that he thinks we all have to make, \u201cThe Great Refusal\u201d. or as he puts it briefly:\u00a0\u201cthe protest against that which is.\u201d Doug Kellner describes it like this:\n\n\u201cMarcuse, on the other hand, constantly advocated the \u201cGreat Refusal\u201d as the proper political response to any form of\u00a0irrational repression, and indeed this seems to be at least the starting point for political activism in the contemporary era: refusal of all forms of oppression and domination, relentless criticism of all policies that impact negatively on working people and progressive social programs, and militant opposition to any and all acts of aggression against Third World countries. Indeed, in an era of \u201cpositive thinking,\u201d conformity, and Yuppies who \u201cgo for it,\u201d it seems that Marcuse\u2019s emphasis on negative thinking, refusal, and opposition provides at least a starting point and part of a renewal of radical politics in the contemporary era.\u201d\n\nNow this leaves the individual with a bit of a problem, and it\u2019s not a trivial problem. Lets say I want to do what I can to ensure that people aren\u2019t being needlessly repressed in today\u2019s world because of thinking from another time in history. This leaves you in a bit of a weird spot. Because any change you want to make to the current system and way that things are\u2026has to be brought about using the tools from within the current system and the way that things are. For example, say you wanted to do something about money being connected to political power. The problem is that the people who would have to pass legislation to fix the problem of money in politics, are the very people who benefit from there being money in politics. Or"}, "episode_86": {"date": "2017-12-2", "text": "Posted on December 2, 2017\nEpisode 113 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #113 on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo hypothetical situation: let\u2019s say you listened to these last five episodes on the Frankfurt school\u2026let\u2019s say you took it upon yourself to do a little more research on your own\u2026 and let\u2019s say you pulled up an overview of all the works Herbert Marcuse ever produced. What you would see\u2026and this applies to many of the key players in the Frankfurt School at the time as well..what you\u2019d see is a very clear, repeated presence of books and essays concerned with the subject of art and aesthetics.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow seeing that\u2026this can be kind of confusing at first\u2026like, why would that be the case? I mean if the task of the Frankfurt School was to find out what went wrong during the thinking of the Enlightenment, to examine the effects of advanced capitalism in the west, to try to figure out why the revolution Marx prophesied never came\u2026if that\u2019s your goal, why are you wasting even a second of your time talking about something like\u2026you know, the form of a piece of artwork\u2026or how people and works of art interface with each other in the world\u2026why are we talking about any of this stuff?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow the extension to that\u2026and it\u2019s a very common, understandable, natural human reaction to what we\u2019ve talked about so far\u2026ok, say Marcuse\u2019s right. I now realize I\u2019m living in a totalitarian society\u2026I mean, is that something we should be taking lightly here? Like really if what the Frankfurt School\u2019s saying is true, why should we be concerned with art right now? Why make a movie about how bad things are? Why are we gonna write a catchy little jingle about how we\u2019re needlessly repressed? No, how about we DO something about it. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s get out into the streets and take back the country that apparently was never ours to begin with! Let\u2019s string politicians up with chicken wire if we have to! It\u2019s time to CHANGE things! Right now.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse would look at this person and he would understand their anger\u2026he would understand their passion for wanting to change the world for the better\u2026but he\u2019d probably say to them\u2026 that when it comes to the process of liberation, from forces of domination that are AS entrenched as these one are\u2026don\u2019t mistake movement, for progress. That being angry and screaming at people and taking to the streets may make you FEEL like you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s changing the world for the better\u2026but you have to examine and re-examine your tactics\u2026are you really changing anything there?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause again, Marxist revolutions throughout history have shown time and time again that you can\u2019t implement these ideas into a capitalist society by force. And again, if something is ever gonna happen that even remotely resembles this kind of revolution that\u2019s being suggested\u2026it\u2019s not gonna come by people taking to the streets\u2026it\u2019s going to come by way of a slow shifting of class consciousness. It\u2019s going to come by educating people. It\u2019s going to come by getting people to see themselves and their place in the world in a different way. It\u2019s going to come by explaining to people how it\u2019s even possible, that every day up until the point they heard this stuff they lived immersed in a system like this without ever realizing it. In other words, in the language of Marcuse, it\u2019s going to come by changing the way that people view their subjectivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow let\u2019s explain that a bit\u2026subjectivity\u2019s one of those words that\u2019s easy for people to bring their own definitions to it\u2026and it may cause some confusion. A bit of foreshadowing here, but when we eventually get to covering the second half of the 20th century on this show, what we\u2019re going to see is a lot of philosophers focusing on this concept in philosophy called subjectivity. Or in other words, where do we get all the ideas we have up in our heads about ourselves, our place in the world and what is going on all around us in our version of reality?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s a key distinction to make there\u2026our version of reality\u2026because as we\u2019re all aware what a particular human being believes is going on all around them is not necessarily connected to what\u2019s actually going on around them\u2026we can see countless examples of this throughout history: If you lived two-thousand years ago as a Platonist you might have had an Essentialist perception of your world. The essence of what you are is that you are a rational animal\u2026navigating the universe of Plato\u2019s Timaeus the world made up of these tetrahedrons and octohedrons that are too small for you to see.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSay you lived a little later in history you might have a subjectivity that was much more informed by religion\u2026a little later than that maybe you\u2019d be informed by idealism and some version of Kant. Flash forward in history from there and you could have a structuralist version of subjectivity\u2026that in the same way\u2026you know if you wanted to explain to someone what a free-throw was in a basketball game\u2026for you to be able to explain to them what a free throw was, they would first have to have an understanding of tons of other things that are related to it, right?\u2026what basketball is\u2026of what a game is\u2026of what sports are at all\u2026but it goes the other way too\u2026they\u2019d also have to have an understanding of what a basketball is\u2026.what a hoop is\u2026what the lines on the floor denote\u2026but even then they\u2019d have to have FURTHER more FUNDAMENTAL knowledge of measurement and distance to be able to understand the concept of 15 feet away from the backboard\u2026this goes on indefinitely in both directions\u2026to explain the concept of a free throw is really to just explain the relationships between a free throw and all of the concepts around it in a given system\u2026the meaning of a free throw\u2026IS the set of relationships it has to other things within a larger system. Well, what if our subjectivity is the same way? That everything about who you are and where you fit into the world is dictated by some system that you\u2019re a part of?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow that\u2019s not where this discussion of subjectivity ends\u2026even beyond that there are post-structuralists that would say\u2026that the very concept of subjectivity is something that we\u2019ve imposed upon discourse\u2026mostly just because it corresponds with language and the subject/object way that we speak about things\u2026but also because of the practical benefits it provides, when we impose this illusion of subjectivity onto ourselves\u2026 now we can do all kinds of cool stuff\u2026we can make truth claims based on a subjective position\u2026now we can construct philosophical systems, tons of stuff\u2026the point is: there are a lot of theories about subjectivity out there, and it\u2019s crucial for us to understand how important this question is to the philosophers doing their work at this time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo in the case of Marcuse\u2026the shifting of class consciousness is the shifting of people\u2019s subjectivity. Where does the average american worker get their subjectivity? Where do they get their ideas about who they are\u2026how they fit into the world\u2026how America fits into the world and everything else? Well, after they graduate school, from the culture industry. Many people get their version of reality from distorted, oversimplified pictures of the world, that are really just products served up to workers to appease them after a long day at a job they don\u2019t feel connected to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee that\u2019s the thing\u2026the culture industry is kind of like the world\u2019s worst psycho-therapist. Like imagine you go in to therapy, you sit down, the person asks you how your week was and you say, gah it was horrible. Horrible. My boss still has it out for me. She\u2019s jealous, she scared I\u2019m gonna take her job and she persecutes me every day. It\u2019s misery. Then I go home and my domestic life partner is just constantly annoying me\u2026and what\u2019s worse: they\u2019re doing it on purpose, doctor! They\u2019re slowly trying to make me slip into madness so that they can lock me away in an institution and get the life insurance money! What if when you said that to the therapist they replied back and said, wow. What a perfectly accurate depiction of what\u2019s going on in your world! I mean, your life is horrible!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo\u2026that would be the worst therapist in the world. The therapists job among many other things is to help get you to see the black and white ways you are looking at the world and present you with alternative version of reality that may be more accurate. Well what does the culture industry do? REINFORCE the black and white ways you\u2019re looking at the world and NOT present you with alternative versions of reality. The culture industry produces masses of people with this type of subjectivity. Masses of people that when they hear a more nuanced, deep discussion\u2026 an alternative view of the world they live in\u2026 they run in the other direction, exhausted and intimidated. Oh, I hear a lot of big words and smart people stuff\u2026I don\u2019t like that\u2026I\u2019m gonna go watch that storage TV show where they find the lost sarcophagus of Ramses the second in Cleveland somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the reason why people like Marcuse are so concerned with art and aesthetics. Because the reality of the world we live in\u2026 is that Marcuse and one of his colleagues can sit around and have discussions all day long about this alternative picture of the average american\u2019s subjectivity\u2026but if the average american worker would rather jump off a building than have to do the work of challenging the way they see things\u2026those words and ideas are effectively doing nothing when it comes to shifting class consciousness. What tools do we have that can get through to people?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell to Marcuse, one of the answers is art. Great works of art have the ability to deliver people a message that normal speech just can\u2019t deliver on it\u2019s own. Great works of art have the ability\u2026 to make people feel\u2026and feel intensely\u2026masses of people\u2026not just people that happen to be a graduate student under Marcuse. Works of art have the ability to show the average person an alternative view of themselves, the way the world is, their subjectivity\u2026and because of this\u2026to Marcuse\u2026works of art have the potential to be a tool for liberation. Liberation from the narrow subjectivity given to Americans by the culture industry.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse says:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe truth of art lies in its power to break the monopoly of established reality to define what is real.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe truth of art. See, in a way Marcuse\u2019s looking at great works of art the same way WE might look at a great science experiment. What\u2019s a great science experiment? Well they\u2019re all equally great, I\u2019m not playing favorites\u2026but how about the ones that lead us to what seems like a more accurate picture of the universe? What happens? Formerly, before we did this science experiment, knowledge about a piece of the universe was obscured from us. Now it should be said, the result of this experiment has ALWAYS been the way that things are\u2026I lived every day of my life up until that point ignorant of this little piece of the universe\u2026and now here I am. A little more enlightened\u2026my view of things around me a little more accurate thanks to this great science experiment. Well to Marcuse, works of art have the ability to do this very same thing at a cultural level. They can show people pieces of reality that were going on all around them that they never noticed before because they were immersed in it. Works of art have the ability to actually SHIFT a person\u2019s subjectivity, and broaden it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow if you think Marcuse\u2019s gonna follow up with hey, everyone! Make a bunch of art that shows people how horrible Capitalism is! No, actually his scope is much larger than that\u2026economics is not the only area art has the potential for liberation. See, Marcuse notices a problem in Marx\u2026when\u00a0Marx looks back at history and sees the exploited class of people in the varying economic systems, he mistakenly spends the majority of his work thinking about the domination and oppression of people, solely in terms of what economic role they play.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse would want to point out, well we obviously know people have been oppressed based on other factors outside of what economic role they play. In the case of the United States specifically\u2026 on racial grounds, predominantly African Americans. Gender grounds, predominantly women. Grounds of sexual orientation, predominantly anything that isn\u2019t heterosexual. Great works of art not only have the ability to show people a different perspective of the world they live in in terms of economics\u2026they also have the ability to show people the struggle and reality of other groups that are repressed for different reasons. The potential for liberation, still there.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, when NWA comes out with the song F the Police in 1988. That song is an opportunity for the average american immersed in their everyday life of work and consumption to see a piece of reality that they don\u2019t necessarily have to see every day in 1988. To hear the pain and anger of a historically repressed group of people. Human beings living in these cordoned off neighborhoods looked at as the other, largely ignored by the governments that serve them, left to fend for themselves, and among all the other problems they have, they\u2019re left to contend with the fact that if they ever have a reason to call the police, they can\u2019t even trust them to enforce the law in a way that doesn\u2019t discriminate against them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis song is an opportunity for the average American worker in 1988\u2026 to see a reality of the world around them that existed the whole time, but they were blocked from seeing it because of the narrow subjectivity the culture industry had given them. Just like with a great science experiment, this song has the potential to deliver to people a slightly more accurate picture of the world they live in, in other words: to change their subjectivity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow you may hear that and think, well what happened? I mean everyone\u2019s heard that song\u2026and it doesn\u2019t seem like it sparked some sort of national discussion and a shifting of class consciousness. Marcuse would probably say, don\u2019t get me wrong. Art is not a panacea. Art may be a tool for liberation but it\u2019s not a tool that\u2019s as effective as a hammer at hammering in a nail. It\u2019s kind of like using a screwdriver to hammer in a nail. It\u2019s janky\u2026and part of the reason why is because Capitalism is just SO resilient, and capable of absorbing any sort of potential liberation and turning it into a money making product for the masses to consume.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSure, that song has the potential to change the way people think about the relationship between police and minorities, but it also has the potential to become co-opted by Capitalism, turned into a hit song, played at the Super Bowl and then eventually the genre being filled with artists worshipping Capitalism constantly talking about what Lamborghini they\u2019re going to buy next. How many people that hear that song hear the cries of historical oppression and how many say, oh man that\u2019s a sick beat. Yeah, I have that song on my phone\u2026anytime the cops pull me over and give me a ticket I blast that song\u2026I get what Ice Cube\u2019s talking about there! No liberation\u2026it just becomes\u2026a product in the consumers infinite landscape of products.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee because as Marcuse would say, liberation always occurs dialectically. What he means by that is, that if art, in any way, ever, leads to the liberation of people\u2026one of the problems you run in to is that it always needs to liberate people while being created and distributed within the current system of domination and the tools that are available. For example if you wanted to try to liberate people from Capitalism, you would need to operate within the system of Capitalism to do that. Same as if you wanted to liberate women, you would have to do so from within a world where women are oppressed and need to be liberated. But don\u2019t take these two examples as a prescription from Marcuse, he\u2019s making a larger point here about liberation in general. That the forces of domination always give rise to the forces of liberation. But one thing we should ALL understand and take EXTREMELY seriously\u2026is that it goes the other way too\u2026the forces of liberation always give rise to the new forces of domination in what appears to be a constant historical cycle that we\u2019re locked in. Marcuse thinks it\u2019s possible to bring about a world where the people being liberated don\u2019t feel the need to dominate and oppress another group of people once they\u2019re liberated. The goal shouldn\u2019t be just taking turns repressing each other for the rest of time. That strategy is EQUALLY ignorant, outdated and from a bygone era of history.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse would say, sure, art is far from perfect. But what better tool do we have within Capitalism to peacefully bring about this world and end this constant dialectic of oppressing each other? What other tools do we have for liberation? What the political system? Marcuse would say, uh, yeah\u2026maybe at ONE point in this country\u2019s history\u2026maybe if this wasn\u2019t AS advanced a version of monopoly capitalism. Good luck unless you have 8 trillion dollars and enough money to outspend all the companies that currently fund the campaigns of politicians in exchange for influence on legislation; no the revolutionary potential of politics has been corroded and disintegrated by Capitalism.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgain, this is why art and aesthetics are so important to many members of the Frankfurt School, not just Marcuse. Because we\u2019re living in an advanced version of monopoly capitalism that has defused and co-opted all of the liberating potential we USED to have\u2026art is one of the only things we have left.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse has a quote:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cArt doesn\u2019t change the world, but it may change the consciousness of people who CAN change the world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow at first that may seem like an applause break point\u2026art doesn\u2019t change the world WE CHANGE IT! But it\u2019s actually referencing something that isn\u2019t immediately on the surface\u2026something that goes hand in hand with his idea of The Great Refusal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo art all by itself, no matter how revolutionary and liberating it may be\u2026doesn\u2019t really do anything. I mean I\u2019m serious if you look at it, it really doesn\u2019t do anything\u2026it\u2019s this inert thing that just kind of hangs there on the museum wall until it decomposes and the sun explodes in 4 billion years. In other words, how revolutionary a piece of artwork is comes down not to the intentions of the artist, not how great of a person they are\u2026but to the answer to the question: how many minds has this piece of artwork changed? To how many people has this piece of art delivered an alternative way of viewing the world that they\u2019re receptive to and hadn\u2019t thought of before? Marcuse would say that if the goal is a shifting of class consciousness\u2026.You can have the most revolutionary piece of art ever in terms of intent by the artist\u2026but if it just hangs there and never inspires any change in people\u2026what has that work of art really done to change things for the better?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Marcuse\u2019s getting at here is a distinction he makes repeatedly in his middle to late work\u2026the difference between theory and praxis. The dictionary definition being actual practice, as distinguished from theory. So you can understand what he\u2019s getting at. You know, theory\u2026you can listen to these theories from the Frankfurt school all day long\u2026replay this series over and over again. You can buy a bunch more books on these theories\u2026you can dedicate you entire life to these theories about the Capitalist Totalitarian society Marcuse thinks we\u2019re living in, but if you never change anything about the way that you live, if you never actually change anything about society for the better\u2026what good were any of these theories just sitting up in your head? Just like the piece of art that just hangs on the wall\u2026if nobody ever hears these ideas and takes action on them, what was the point?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarcuse says that the point of theory SHOULD be to inform and direct praxis. Not to sit around in academic institutions theorizing about things until the end of time. Not just to understand the ideas we\u2019ve talked about in this series, but to actually make The Great Refusal and live in opposition to affluent society. There\u2019s a reason he refers to The Great Refusal as a form of radical subjectivity. There\u2019s a reason he thinks of true art as a physical embodiment of radical subjectivity. Because you can have the best intentions in the world with your art, you can take to the streets and scream at people all you want, but if you\u2019re not getting through to people, changing their minds, broadening their subjectivity\u2026you might be mistaking movement with progress.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLike we talked about, if any of this stuff the Frankfurt School says has any validity, it\u2019s a natural human reaction to want to be angry and scream at people in the street\u2026 but if progress is defined by a shifting of class consciousness, and you can count on one hand the number of people whose subjectivity has been broadened by your screaming, Marcuse would say maybe it\u2019s best to reexamine your strategy.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo Marcuse\u2019s not a fan of getting angry, screaming, being condescending towards these \u201cdumb\u201d people that just don\u2019t realize the truth. To Marcuse, this isn\u2019t the fault of the working class for going along with it. These are not evil people\u2026these are people that should be treated with compassion\u2026people who were born against their will\u2026into a culture they had no control over\u2026educated by teachers and programs that they had no ultimate say in\u2026spat out into a alienated workforce that they didn\u2019t sign off on. These aren\u2019t people you should be mad at and blame, to Marcuse, they\u2019re byproducts of historical forces that were out of their control. Why be pompous and condescending and call them dumb?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe path forward to Marcuse is not anger and blame\u2026it is theory and praxis. Praxis would be misguided, out of control screaming in the streets if it didn\u2019t have a good strategy and theory behind it, and theory without praxis would just be a bunch of people talking about things and never actually doing anything.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe real trick to Marcuse is finding a balance between the two and being honest enough with yourself to take a true assessment of how much good you\u2019re really doing. But that said\u2026 he and other members of the Frankfurt School\u2026 would want to point out that is much easier said than done.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI mean, you\u2019re not fighting against a sweet little, fluffy kitten here\u2026you\u2019re fighting against, monopoly Capitalism. This enemy is resilient. This enemy sees you coming and has dozens, hundreds of traps for you to fall into that silence radical subjectivity and transform you into somebody that just perpetuates the system.\u00a0Living the Great Refusal, saying no to affluent society and that which is\u2026Capitalism looks at you as a human being the same way it looks at a piece of artwork. What I mean is, again, a great piece of artwork is a physical embodiment of radical subjectivity\u2026 where sometimes the forces of Capitalism step in, take control over it, remove it\u2019s potential for liberation and turn it into just a product. Well so too, if you\u2019re living as an embodiment of radical subjectivity, Capitalism has ways of removing your potential for liberation\u2026 and turning YOU into someone who just keeps the status-quo going.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee, truly living the great refusal\u2026 can sometimes take an enormous amount of sacrifice. The people who have made the choice to fight against the way that things are\u2026many of them have uprooted their entire existence, these aren\u2019t just ideas to them\u2026they suffer and grind on a daily basis for the cause of liberation, many of them have even given their own life. We can do an episode on the Great Refusal once again I\u2019m going to leave it up to the demand I receive, but the point I want to make is that there is a big difference between people that hear the ideas of the Frankfurt School, think they\u2019re making good points and complain about how messed up the system is, and these people that are actually making The Great Refusal. It\u2019s not the Good Refusal. Not the fair to midland refusal. These traps that Capitalism sets for you to fall into\u2026they\u2019re so alluring. When you\u2019ve structured your life around and lived so long in work mode and consumption mode\u2026such an easy trap to fall into is to hear these theories, get angry, feel indignant and self-righteous, and then spend the rest of your life screaming and chanting and pepper spraying your way to never changing a single person\u2019s subjectivity. Such an easy trap\u2026to have all the theories right, but the wrong kind of praxis. What\u2019s ironic to Marcuse, because of the power of Capitalism\u2026is how easy it is to know the theories of the Frankfurt School and become as complicit in the way that things are as the people you\u2019re screaming at.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen average american goes to their job, feel alienated, never question anything, and consume products by the culture industry that reinforce their idea that nothing is wrong with the United States, they will go on to change the subjectivity of a grand total of zero people. Doesn\u2019t matter how right your theories are\u2026if your method of praxis is not actually changing people\u2019s minds\u2026if it\u2019s not finding a way to relate to your fellow people as a human beings and convey a message\u2026if it\u2019s only serving to scratch some personal itch you have of feeling like something drastic needs to change about the world\u2026you\u2019re not changing people\u2019s subjectivity\u2026you\u2019re being selfish\u2026all the while perpetuating the vice grip Capitalism has on the country, where in your own small way you ensure that people will continue to be polarized in this country, dogmatic about their beliefs, talking towards each other, talking past each other\u2026but never talking with each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for listening.

Find both on the front page of philosophizethis.org. Today\u2019s episode is part six on the Frankfurt School. I hope you love the show today.\n\nSo hypothetical situation: let\u2019s say you listened to these last five episodes on the Frankfurt school\u2026let\u2019s say you took it upon yourself to do a little more research on your own\u2026 and let\u2019s say you pulled up an overview of all the works Herbert Marcuse ever produced. What you would see\u2026and this applies to many of the key players in the Frankfurt School at the time as well..what you\u2019d see is a very clear, repeated presence of books and essays concerned with the subject of art and aesthetics.\n\nNow seeing that\u2026this can be kind of confusing at first\u2026like, why would that be the case? I mean if the task of the Frankfurt School was to find out what went wrong during the thinking of the Enlightenment, to examine the effects of advanced capitalism in the west, to try to figure out why the revolution Marx prophesied never came\u2026if that\u2019s your goal, why are you wasting even a second of your time talking about something like\u2026you know, the form of a piece of artwork\u2026or how people and works of art interface with each other in the world\u2026why are we talking about any of this stuff?\n\nNow the extension to that\u2026and it\u2019s a very common, understandable, natural human reaction to what we\u2019ve talked about so far\u2026ok, say Marcuse\u2019s right. I now realize I\u2019m living in a totalitarian society\u2026I mean, is that something we should be taking lightly here? Like really if what the Frankfurt School\u2019s saying is true, why should we be concerned with art right now? Why make a movie about how bad things are? Why are we gonna write a catchy little jingle about how we\u2019re needlessly repressed? No, how about we DO something about it. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s get out into the streets and take back the country that apparently was never ours to begin with! Let\u2019s string politicians up with chicken wire if we have to! It\u2019s time to CHANGE things! Right now.\n\nMarcuse would look at this person and he would understand their anger\u2026he would understand their passion for wanting to change the world for the better\u2026but he\u2019d probably say to them\u2026 that when it comes to the process of liberation, from forces of domination that are AS entrenched as these one are\u2026don\u2019t mistake movement, for progress. That being angry and screaming at people and taking to the streets may make you FEEL like you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s changing the world for the better\u2026but you have to examine and re-examine your tactics\u2026are you really changing anything there?\n\nBecause again, Marxist revolutions throughout history have shown time and time again that you can\u2019t implement these ideas into a capitalist society by force. And again, if something is ever gonna happen that even remotely resembles this kind of revolution that\u2019s being suggested\u2026it\u2019s not gonna come by people taking to the streets\u2026it\u2019s going to come by way of a slow shifting of class consciousness. It\u2019s going to come by educating people. It\u2019s going to come by getting people to see themselves and their place in the world in a different way. It\u2019s going to come by explaining to people how it\u2019s even possible, that every day up until the point they heard this stuff they lived immersed in a system like this without ever realizing it. In other words, in the language of Marcuse, it\u2019s going to come by changing the way that people view their subjectivity.\n\nNow let\u2019s explain that a bit\u2026subjectivity\u2019s one of those words that\u2019s easy for people to bring their own definitions to it\u2026and it may cause some confusion. A bit of foreshadowing here, but when we eventually get to covering the second half of the 20th century on this show, what we\u2019re going to see is a lot of philosophers focusing on this concept in philosophy called subjectivity. Or in other words, where do we get all the ideas we have up in our heads about ourselves, our place in the world and what is going on all around us in our version of reality?\n\nThat\u2019s a key distinction to make there\u2026our version of reality\u2026because as we\u2019re all aware what a particular human being believes is going on all around them is not necessarily connected to what\u2019s actually going on around them\u2026we can see countless examples of this throughout history: If you lived two-thousand years ago as a Platonist you might have had an Essentialist perception of your world. The essence of what you are is that you are a rational animal\u2026navigating the universe of Plato\u2019s Timaeus the world made up of these tetrahedrons and octohedrons that are too small for you to see.\n\nSay you lived a little later in history you might have a subjectivity that was much more informed by religion\u2026a little later than that maybe you\u2019d be informed by idealism and some version of Kant. Flash forward in history from there and you could have a structuralist version of subjectivity\u2026that in the same way\u2026you know if you wanted to explain to someone what a free-throw was in a basketball game\u2026for you to be able to explain to them what a free throw was, they would first have to have an understanding of tons of other things that are related to it, right?\u2026what basketball is\u2026of what a game is\u2026of what sports are at all\u2026but it goes the other way too\u2026they\u2019d also have to have an understanding of what a basketball is\u2026.what a hoop is\u2026what the lines on the floor denote\u2026but even then they\u2019d have to have FURTHER more FUNDAMENTAL knowledge of measurement and distance to be able to understand the concept of 15 feet away from the backboard\u2026this goes on indefinitely in both directions\u2026to explain the concept of a free throw is really to just explain the relationships between a free throw and all of the concepts around it in a given system\u2026the meaning of a free throw\u2026IS the set of relationships it has to other things within a larger system. Well, what if our subjectivity is the same way? That everything about who you are and where you fit into the world is dictated by some system that you\u2019re a part of?\n\nNow that\u2019s not where this discussion of subjectivity ends\u2026even beyond that there are post-structuralists that would say\u2026that the very concept of subjectivity is something that we\u2019ve imposed upon discourse\u2026mostly just because it corresponds with language and the subject/object way that we speak about things\u2026but also because of the practical benefits it provides, when we impose this illusion of subjectivity onto ourselves\u2026 now we can do all kinds of cool stuff\u2026we can make truth claims based on a subjective position\u2026now we can construct philosophical systems, tons of stuff\u2026the point is: there are a lot of theories about subjectivity out there, and it\u2019s crucial for us to understand how important this question is to the philosophers doing their work at this time.\n\nSo in the case of Marcuse\u2026the shifting of class consciousness is the shifting of people\u2019s subjectivity. Where does the average american worker get their subjectivity? Where do they get their ideas about who they are\u2026how they fit into the world\u2026how America fits into the world and everything else? Well, after they graduate school, from the culture industry. Many people get their version of reality from distorted, oversimplified pictures of the world, that are really just products served up to workers to appease them after a long day at a job they don\u2019t feel connected to.\n\nSee that\u2019s the thing\u2026the culture industry is kind of like the world\u2019s worst psycho-therapist. Like imagine you go in to therapy, you sit down, the person asks you how your week was and you say, gah it was horrible. Horrible. My boss still has it out for me. She\u2019s jealous, she scared I\u2019m gonna take her job and she persecutes me every day. It\u2019s misery. Then I go home and my domestic life partner is just constantly annoying me\u2026and what\u2019s worse: they\u2019re doing it on purpose, doctor! They\u2019re slowly trying to make me slip into madness so that they can lock me away in an institution and get the life insurance money! What if when you said that to the therapist they replied back and said, wow. What a perfectly accurate depiction of what\u2019s going on in your world! I mean, your life is horrible!\n\nNo\u2026that would be the worst therapist in the world. The therapists job among many other things is to help get you to see the black and white ways you are looking at the world and present you with alternative version of reality that may be more accurate. Well what does the culture industry do? REINFORCE the black and white ways you\u2019re looking at the world and NOT present you with alternative versions of reality. The culture industry produces masses of people with this type of subjectivity. Masses of people that when they hear a more nuanced, deep discussion\u2026 an alternative view of the world they live in\u2026 they run in the other direction, exhausted and intimidated. Oh, I hear a lot of big words and smart people stuff\u2026I don\u2019t like that\u2026I\u2019m gonna go watch that storage TV show where they find the lost sarcophagus of Ramses the second in Cleveland somewhere.\n\nThis is the reason why people like Marcuse are so concerned with art and aesthetics. Because the reality of the world we live in\u2026 is that Marcuse and one of his colleagues can sit around and have discussions all day long about this alternative picture of the average american\u2019s subjectivity\u2026but if the average american worker would rather jump off a building than have to do the work of challenging the way they see things\u2026those words and ideas are effectively doing nothing when it comes to shifting class consciousness. What tools do we have that can get through to people?\n\nWell to Marcuse, one of the answers is art. Great works of art have the ability to deliver people a message that normal speech just can\u2019t deliver on it\u2019s own. Great works of art have the ability\u2026 to make people feel\u2026and feel intensely\u2026masses of people\u2026not just people that happen to be a graduate student under Marcuse. Works of art have the ability to show the average person an alternative view of themselves, the way the world is, their subjectivity\u2026and because of this\u2026to Marcuse\u2026works of art have the potential to be a tool for liberation. Liberation from the narrow subjectivity given to Americans by the culture industry.\n\nMarcuse says:\n\nThe truth of art. See, in a way Marcuse\u2019s looking at great works of art the same way WE might look at a great science experiment. What\u2019s a great science experiment? Well they\u2019re all equally great, I\u2019m not playing favorites\u2026but how about the ones that lead us to what seems like a more accurate picture of the universe? What happens? Formerly, before we did this science experiment, knowledge about a piece of the universe was obscured from us. Now it should be said, the result of this experiment has ALWAYS been the way that things are\u2026I lived every day of my life up until that point ignorant of this little piece of the universe\u2026and now here I am. A little more enlightened\u2026my view of things around me a little more accurate thanks to this great science experiment. Well to Marcuse, works of art have the ability to do this very same thing at a cultural level. They can show people pieces of reality that were going on all around them that they never noticed before because they were immersed in it. Works of art have the ability to actually SHIFT a person\u2019s subjectivity, and broaden it.\n\nNow if you think Marcuse\u2019s gonna follow up with hey, everyone! Make a bunch of art that shows people how horrible Capitalism is! No, actually his scope is much larger than that\u2026economics is not the only area art has the potential for liberation. See, Marcuse notices a problem in Marx\u2026when\u00a0Marx looks back at history and sees the exploited class of people in the varying economic systems, he mistakenly spends the majority of his work thinking about the domination and oppression of people, solely in terms of what economic role they play.\n\nMarcuse would want to point out, well we obviously know people have been oppressed based on other factors outside of what economic role they play. In the case of the United States specifically\u2026 on racial grounds, predominantly African Americans. Gender grounds, predominantly women. Grounds of sexual orientation, predominantly anything that isn\u2019t heterosexual. Great works of art not only have the ability to show people a different perspective of the world they live in in terms of economics\u2026they also have the ability to show people the struggle and reality of other groups that are repressed for different reasons. The potential for liberation, still there.\n\nFor example, when NWA comes out with the song F the Police in 1988. That song is an opportunity for the average american immersed in their everyday life of work and consumption to see a piece of reality that they don\u2019t necessarily have to see every day in 1988. To hear the pain and anger of a historically repressed group of people. Human beings living in these cordoned off neighborhoods looked at as the other, largely ignored by the governments that serve them, left to fend for themselves, and among all the other problems they have, they\u2019re left to contend with the fact that if they ever have a reason to call the police, they can\u2019t even trust them to enforce the law in a way that doesn\u2019t discriminate against them.\n\nThis song is an opportunity for the average American worker in 1988\u2026 to see a reality of the world around them that existed the whole time, but they were blocked from seeing it because of the narrow subjectivity the culture industry had given them. Just like with a great science experiment, this song has the potential to deliver to people a slightly more accurate picture of the world they live in, in other words: to change their subjectivity.\n\nNow you may hear that and think, well what happened? I mean everyone\u2019s heard that song\u2026and it doesn\u2019t seem like it sparked some sort of national discussion and a shifting of class consciousness. Marcuse would probably say, don\u2019t get me wrong. Art is not a panacea. Art may be a tool for liberation but it\u2019s not a tool that\u2019s as effective as a hammer at hammering in a nail. It\u2019s kind of like using a screwdriver to hammer in a nail. It\u2019s janky\u2026and part of the reason why is because Capitalism is just SO resilient, and capable of absorbing any sort of potential liberation and turning it into a money making product for the masses to consume.\n\nSure, that song has the potential to change the way people think about the relationship between police and minorities, but it also has the potential to become co-opted by Capitalism, turned into a hit song, played at the Super Bowl and then eventually the genre being filled with artists worshipping Capitalism constantly talking about what Lamborghini they\u2019re going to buy next. How many people that hear that song hear the cries of historical oppression and how many say, oh man that\u2019s a sick beat. Yeah, I have that song on my phone\u2026anytime the cops pull me over and give me a ticket I blast that song\u2026I get what Ice Cube\u2019s talking about there! No liberation\u2026it just becomes\u2026a product in the consumers infinite landscape of products.\n\nSee because as Marcuse would say, liberation always occurs dialectically. What he means by that is, that if art, in any way, ever, leads to the liberation of people\u2026one of the problems you run in to is that it always needs to liberate people while being created and distributed within the current system of domination and the tools that are available. For example if you wanted to try to liberate people from Capitalism, you would need to operate within the system of Capitalism to do that. Same as if you wanted to liberate women, you would have to do so from within a world where women are oppressed and need to be liberated. But don\u2019t take these two examples as a prescription from Marcuse, he\u2019s making a larger point here about liberation in general. That the forces of domination always give rise to the forces of liberation. But one thing we should ALL understand and take EXTREMELY seriously\u2026is that it goes the other way too\u2026the forces of liberation always give rise to the new forces of domination in what appears to be a constant historical cycle that we\u2019re locked in. Marcuse thinks it\u2019s possible to bring about a world where the people being liberated don\u2019t feel the need to dominate and oppress another group of people once they\u2019re liberated. The goal shouldn\u2019t be just taking turns repressing each other for the rest of time. That strategy is EQUALLY ignorant, outdated and from a bygone era of history.\n\nMarcuse would say, sure, art is far from perfect. But what better tool do we have within Capitalism to peacefully bring about this world and end this constant dialectic of oppressing each other? What other tools do we have for liberation? What the political system? Marcuse would say, uh, yeah\u2026maybe at ONE point in this country\u2019s history\u2026maybe if this wasn\u2019t AS advanced a version of monopoly capitalism. Good luck unless you have 8 trillion dollars and enough money to outspend all the companies that currently fund the campaigns of politicians in exchange for influence on legislation; no the revolutionary potential of politics has been corroded and disintegrated by Capitalism.\n\nAgain, this is why art and aesthetics are so important to many members of the Frankfurt School, not just Marcuse. Because we\u2019re living in an advanced version of monopoly capitalism that has defused and co-opted all of the liberating potential we USED to have\u2026art is one of the only things we have left.\n\nMarcuse has a quote:\n\n\u201cArt doesn\u2019t change the world, but it may change the consciousness of people who CAN change the world.\u201d\n\nNow at first that may seem like an applause break point\u2026art doesn\u2019t change the world WE CHANGE IT! But it\u2019s actually referencing something that isn\u2019t immediately on the surface\u2026something that goes hand in hand with his idea of The Great Refusal.\n\nSo art all by itself, no matter how revolutionary and liberating it may be\u2026doesn\u2019t really do anything. I mean I\u2019m serious if you look at it, it really doesn\u2019t do anything\u2026it\u2019s this inert thing that just kind of hangs there on the museum wall until it decomposes and the sun explodes in 4 billion years. In other words, how revolutionary a piece of artwork is comes down not to the intentions of the artist, not how great of a person they are\u2026but to the answer to the question: how many minds has this piece of artwork changed? To how many people has this piece of art delivered an alternative way of viewing the world that they\u2019re receptive to and hadn\u2019t thought of before? Marcuse would say that if the goal is a shifting of class consciousness\u2026.\n\nThe real trick to Marcuse is finding a balance between the two and being honest enough with yourself to take a true assessment of how much good you\u2019re really doing. But that said\u2026 he and other members of the Frankfurt School\u2026 would want to point out that is much easier said than done.\n\nagain, a great piece of artwork is a physical embodiment of radical subjectivity\u2026 where sometimes the forces of Capitalism step in, take control over it, remove it\u2019s potential for liberation and turn it into just a product. Well so too, if you\u2019re living as an embodiment of radical subjectivity, Capitalism has ways of removing your potential for liberation\u2026 and turning YOU into someone who just keeps the status-quo going.\n\nSee, truly living the great refusal\u2026 can sometimes take an enormous amount of sacrifice. The people who have made the choice to fight against the way that things are\u2026many of them have uprooted their entire existence, these aren\u2019t just ideas to them\u2026they suffer and grind on a daily basis for the cause of liberation, many of them have even given their own life. We can do an episode on the Great Refusal once again I\u2019m going to leave it up to the demand I receive, but the point I want to make is that there is a big difference between people that hear the ideas of the Frankfurt School, think they\u2019re making good points and complain about how messed up the system is, and these people that are actually making The Great Refusal. It\u2019s not the Good Refusal. Not the fair to midland refusal. These traps that Capitalism sets for you to fall into\u2026they\u2019re so alluring. When you\u2019ve structured your life around and lived so long in work mode and consumption mode\u2026such an easy trap to fall into is to hear these theories, get angry, feel indignant and self-righteous, and then spend the rest of your life screaming and chanting and pepper spraying your way to never changing a single person\u2019s subjectivity. Such an easy trap\u2026to have all the theories right, but the wrong kind of praxis. What\u2019s ironic to Marcuse, because of the power of Capitalism\u2026is how easy it is to know the theories of the Frankfurt School and become as complicit in the way that things are as the people you\u2019re screaming at.\n\nWhen average american goes to their job, feel alienated, never question anything, and consume products by the culture industry that reinforce their idea that nothing is wrong with the United States, they will go on to change the subjectivity of a grand total of zero people. Doesn\u2019t matter how right your theories are\u2026if your method of praxis is not actually changing people\u2019s minds\u2026if it\u2019s not finding a way to relate to your fellow people as a human beings and convey a message\u2026if it\u2019s only serving to scratch some personal itch you have of feeling like something drastic needs to change about the world\u2026you\u2019re not changing people\u2019s subjectivity\u2026you\u2019re being selfish\u2026all the while perpetuating the vice grip Capitalism has on the country, where in your own small way you ensure that people will continue to be polarized in this country, dogmatic about their beliefs, talking towards each other, talking past each other\u2026but never talking with each other.\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_88": {"date": "2018-3-23", "text": "Posted on March 23, 2018\nEpisode 115 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #115 on the origins of Structuralism. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo when we first began this massive, most recent arc of the show on the philosophical conversations of the 20th century I said that the first thing we\u2019re going to need is a much deeper understanding of Sartre. Well by the end of today\u2019s episode we\u2019re going to understand why that was the case. What I also said back then is that every several episodes or so we need to take a step back and give some context about the state of philosophy and what these thinkers are responding to when doing their work. See because it\u2019s so easy to skip ahead, not understand the questions these thinkers thought were worth answering and miss out on a lot of big changes that are occurring in human history at this time that shaped the world we live in today.\n\nYou know, I was thinking the other day: since we began this recent arc of the show, every thinker we\u2019ve covered so far has been a continental philosopher. But then I started thinking: wait a second\u2026this show masquerades around as a beginner friendly conversation about the progression of human thought in the 20th century and we\u2019ve never once talked about the distinction between continental and analytic philosophy. What do we mean when we say continental vs analytic philosophy? To better understand this story\u00a0to come that needs to be told, I think it\u2019s crucial information to have\u2026so I want to touch on it briefly right now\u2026and whether you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, whether you\u2019ve heard those terms used and kind of know what they mean, whether you\u2019re the worlds foremost expert on continental and analytic philosophy\u2026one very important thing to consider right off the bat is to not fall into the trap of overgeneralizing thinkers and rigidly placing them into these two neat categories in your mind. You know, they\u2019re either a continental philosopher or an analytic philosopher.\n\nReally these two words\u2026 they\u2019re not titles to be branded into the side of thinkers\u2026they\u2019re more just, practical terms that are used when people are broadly discussing the history of philosophy in the 20th century\u2026thinkers crossover all the time\u2026but nevertheless it\u2019s important to understand why people usually talk about philosophy as having these two distinct approaches during this time period.\n\nThere are several different theories but one of the most common ones is that these are two different areas of philosophy that can ultimately be traced back to assertions made in the work of Immanuel Kant. Real quick if you remember\u2026Kant is doing his philosophy right after people like Hume and Leibniz. Right when philosophers are re-examining the more classical idea of what truth is and how we can arrive at knowledge. Right after ideas like what\u2019s often called Hume\u2019s fork or Leibniz\u2019s claim that there are only two ways we can ever arrive at the truth about things\u2026there are truths of reason\u2026and truths of fact. When he says truths of fact, he\u2019s talking about something we can know is true because it can be immediately verified empirically in our experience of the world, for example, someone can say the faucet is on in the downstairs bathroom\u2026 and Leibniz would say that we can know whether this statement is true or false because we can walk into the bathroom and immediately experience that the faucet is, in fact, on. What Leibniz means by truths of reason are things that we can know are true simply by virtue of the definitions that we\u2019ve prescribed to the terms in the proposition. For example, all triangles have three sides. All bachelors are unmarried. 1+1=2. In other words, the definitions of the terms in these statements are what make them true. These are examples of truths of reason. Another name these two types of statements often get in philosophy around this time is a priori (truths of reason) and a posteriori (truths of fact).\n\nWell facing this argument during his own time, Kant finds himself in a tricky situation. The problem is if these really are the only two kinds of truth that we can arrive at\u2026where does that leave philosophy? Truths of fact where we are empirically verifying things\u2026that\u2019s the realm of science. That\u2019s what science does so well. Should philosophers just start becoming scientists now in Kant\u2019s time? On the other hand, with truths of reason\u2026is the life of a philosopher to just sit around talking about triangles and bachelors all day? And here\u2019s his point: might there be another type of true statement that can be made that we\u2019re all forgetting about here? This is where Kant introduces his idea of a synthetic a priori proposition or simply put, there are some things out there that we are capable of reasoning to an understanding of, that don\u2019t just have to do with the definitions of things like statements about triangles and bachelors, but that aren\u2019t the kind of things we can experience empirically or measure with a science experiment.\n\nWell here\u2019s where the split between continental and analytic philosophy emerges\u2026we have on one hand, through the work of G.E. Moore, quickly on to Bertrand Russell, Ernst Mach and then to a group of thinkers that would eventually be called The Vienna Circle, which we\u2019ll talk about soon\u2026on one hand thinkers like these started taking issue with this concept that Kant\u2019s lays out of synthetic a priori propositions. This has come to be known as the analytic tradition of philosophy, while on the other hand, an entirely different group of thinkers took issue with what they saw as problems in Kant\u2019s concept of there being two distinct worlds that exist: a world of things in themselves and a world of human experience, this has come to be known as the continental tradition within philosophy. Put another way\u2026we have one major approach to philosophy at this time that primarily takes issue with Kant\u2019s epistemology (the analytic tradition)\u2026and another major approach that takes issue with Kant\u2019s metaphysics. (the continental tradition) Now as you can imagine, as thinkers start giving their responses and then the responses to the responses, and so on\u2026 what\u2019s actually being talked about starts to resemble Kant less and less, but many historians of philosophy still trace the origins of these conversations back to the work of Kant.\n\nNow as you can ALSO imagine, as these two different approaches to what philosophy should be spending its time on continued to develop, both camps come up with their own individual methods of conducting philosophy. For example, if you\u2019re a member of the analytic tradition\u2026 and you think that what philosophy should be spending it\u2019s time on is getting philosophy out of the business of making sweeping metaphysical claims as it has in the past, and in the business of following up philosophy\u2019s history of questioning what we can know, how we can know it, in other words, linguistic analysis, formal logic, how our thoughts work, what\u2019s wrong with Kant\u2019s synthetic a priori, what exactly are we engaging in when we SAY something like all triangles have three sides? Now, if these are the kinds of things you think philosophy should be focusing on, well these are very clearly defined problems to deal with and your solution is probably going to involve being very analytic\u2026breaking propositions down into their component parts and understanding the relationship between the parts. Why is this an important thing to focus on for human beings as a species? Well, language and the way we make propositions about things in the world is, again, not some method that was handed down by a deity or some philosopher king in the form of webster\u2019s dictionary. No, language is a massively flawed, imprecise, messed up collection of agreements made by a bunch of people in the past. That in the past whenever we\u2019ve used reason to arrive at ideas that hopefully are going to make the world a better place, sometimes have made the world a horrible place\u2026we\u2019re ultimately communicating those rational thoughts through the filter of language. So if you\u2019re an analytic philosopher like say Wittgenstein for example\u2026the thinking is: we have to figure out this language thing and this formal logic thing a lot better than we do right now\u2026because what if most of the problems we\u2019ve run into in the ideas that we\u2019re coming up with\u2026 come down to people using language imprecisely, or even worse\u2026trying to use language to talk about subject matters that language is completely incapable of describing?\n\nNow if you\u2019re a continental philosopher\u2026it\u2019s often said that analytic philosophy focuses on analysis\u2026continental philosophy focuses on synthesis. We\u2019ve already seen examples of this in the ideas of Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir and Marcuse and many others\u2026what this is, is any set of ideas that attempts to look at a wide array of things that have to do with existence\u2026for example, history, and people, and art and literature, and economics, they look at all these things\u2026and try to find some way that all of these can be synthesized together and understood by relating to some grand philosophical narrative. Consciousness is freedom. The Ambiguity of existence. The historical forces of domination and liberation. The study of Ontology if you\u2019re Heidegger. Questions in the continental tradition sound more like, what does it mean to be me? How do I fit into the world? How did the world get the way that it is? What is the nature of subjectivity? Now, why should these questions matter to us as a species? Well, as we\u2019ve already touched on in the Heidegger series, there just seems to be more to philosophy than studying language and thoughts and the propositions we make\u2026to Heidegger\u2026language and formal logic are a prison that he\u2019s trying to break philosophy out of. This is why he\u2019s so interested in using phenomenology to study being at it\u2019s very foundations\u2026in other words, before we ever add on these abstractions and human inventions like language and logic that just narrow and distort the way that we look at what it is to be. He\u2019d say that if you go every day of your life with people describing what the world is in a language that requires that for something to be a complete sentence there needs to be a subject acting upon an object. A world where you\u2019re required to frame every thought that you have in the same way\u2026how much of an effect does that have on the way we see ourselves? How much of an effect is that going to have on the philosophy you\u2019re going to produce\u2026or the way you\u2019re going to treat other people?\n\nNow understanding, these two distinct approaches to what people felt philosophy should be focusing on at this time in the early 20th century is crucial context to have\u2026because it\u2019s right around this time\u2026there\u2019s about to be a breakthrough in human thought\u2026 it\u2019s a breakthrough that is going to instantly get people to rethink the way human beings have been looking at practically every field of study in the past. It\u2019s a breakthrough where once people started talking about this insight\u2026the major works of it explicitly calling out the work of Jean-Paul Sartre\u2026Sartre being someone who was a public intellectual, who wrote every single day of his life, ALWAYS had thoughts and responses to give, and even HE never replied to the criticisms of his work, the feeling of the philosophical community at the time was that this was an admission of defeat. This was a breakthrough that made several of the major foundational claims of existentialism start to seem\u2026pretty naive. Started to make the history of how we\u2019ve been approaching everything seem pretty naive. What\u2019s really interesting to consider is that this breakthrough didn\u2019t come in the field of philosophy\u2026or science\u2026or mathematics or any of these fields where it may seem more likely for a major breakthrough to occur\u2026it actually came in the field of linguistics. Through the work of a man named Ferdinand de Saussure. So I want to talk for a little about this insight that Saussure has that is most easily seen when we look at language\u2026and then for the next couple episodes talk about the massive implications this has on practically every other field of study when thinkers apply it.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure is credited with being the founder of something called Semiotics. Semiotics, put in a very simple way, is the study of signs. Signs, put in a very simple way, are things that people use, for practical reasons, that stand in for something else. The basic concept that we\u2019re talking about here is not complex at all\u2026it\u2019s something all of us do thousands of times a day and don\u2019t even think about it. One example of a sign that we\u2019re all familiar with would be a word. Let\u2019s say I wanted to convey to you the concept of a cow. Well without words\u2026how do I do that? Well, we could just walk around until we find a cow on the side of the road and I could frantically point at it and jump up and down\u2026but quite frankly nobody really has the time to do that and then once you show me the cow\u2026now what? You just wanted to show me\u2026cow? No there\u2019s something about the cow you want to tell me and now we have to walk around until you can point at the next thing. Nobody wants to live like this\u2026so what do we do\u2026we come up with a sign that stands in for that cow when there\u2019s not one immediately next to you\u2026the word cow. The word C-O-W, cow acts as a stand in\u2026I can write it on a piece of paper\u2026I can say the word cow and it instantly delivers to you a message that has a very specific meaning that is transmitted into your head. Now for our discussion here today the terms sign and word can pretty much be used interchangeably, but it should be said that Semiotics and the study of signs goes far beyond just the study of words. For example, if I wanted to convey to you the concept of a cow, I don\u2019t always have to use words. I could draw you a picture of a cow\u2026and that picture could vary from just a doodle of a cow on a post-it note\u2026to the most photo realistic painting of a cow you\u2019ve ever seen. I could mime to you what it looks like to be a cow, and moo and frolic through the grass on all fours, that\u2019s a sign too. You know how two people that don\u2019t speak the same language will try to communicate by acting out what it is they\u2019re talking about? That\u2019s an example of them using signs to try to deliver a message with a specific meaning. Signs even extend to things beyond some person trying to convey a message. You could look at a field and see the lines in the grass and the smell of fresh cut grass and that could be a sign that delivers the message that the grass was just cut.\n\nNow when you study all of these examples of what signs are, Ferdinand De Saussure says that all signs can be broken down into two primary parts. What he calls the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the actual word cow, or the drawing of the cow or more generally the thing that is standing in for the thing that\u2019s being referenced that isn\u2019t right in front of us. The signified, as you can probably guess, is the concept of cow that is being referenced\u2026it\u2019s the concept of the thing that the signifier is standing in for. Now all of this may seem really obvious to you, and like we\u2019re needlessly complicating things that are really simple\u2026yeah, ok there\u2019s a word and then there\u2019s the thing it\u2019s referencing\u2026I got it. But what Ferdinand De Saussure does next\u2026changes the world. He makes the claim that there is zero necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. In other words, there\u2019s nothing about three squiggly lines on a piece of paper\u2026the letters c-o-w that necessarily corresponds with the four legged creature frolicking around in pastures all over the world.\n\nWhat he\u2019s responding to here is a long tradition of thinkers wondering how exactly languages emerge. We assume that at one point, there wasn\u2019t language, and now there is language. People want to find out: how did that process go? Well a common theory throughout history has been that it must have started with a lot of pointing and grunting and miming things until language became more sophisticated. And that process of sophistication was guided by people creating words that directly correspond with the world they\u2019re trying to describe. The obvious example of this is onomatopoeia. We say the word meow, because it sounds like the actual sound the cat is making. We have the word boom because boom kind of sounds like the sound of something exploding. In other words, there is a direct relationship between signifier and signified. That something about the words themselves directly correspond with something about the way the world is. And there are of course very real problems with this theory, not the least of which are the extreme differences even just between different languages that are describing the same thing in the world with words that sound and look very different from each other\u2026but again what Ferdinand De Saussure is going to finally say is that there\u2019s nothing about the sound cow or the squiggly lines c-o-w on a piece of paper that depicts something necessarily connected to the four legged grass eating animal that it\u2019s referencing. The word cow is a cultural construction. We constructed it\u2026because we wanted to be able to communicate more efficiently\u2026not because it objectively corresponds with something in the actual world.\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing: if what Saussure is saying here is true, this raises an extremely important question for the field of linguistics. The question is at what point does the sound cow and the letters c-o-w written on a piece of paper become injected with meaning? Where exactly does that meaning come from? And what Saussure is going to say is that the meaning of a word lies in the relationships between that word and all of the other words within a larger system. Put another way, the word \u201ccow\u201d means something to us, only in the sense that it is not the word, cat or cob or conduit or any of the thousands of other words we have within a larger system that we call the English language, it\u2019s the larger structure that gives the word its meaning.\n\nWhat he\u2019s also going to say is that what Semiotics shows us on a more macro level\u2026pick any sentence you want that conveys a meaningful message\u2026actually, for the sake of the example pick a sentence that is eight words long. There are 40,320 ways that you can re-arrange all the words in that sentence\u2026and practically every combination creates a sentence that is utterly meaningless to us. They\u2019re just random words next to each other with no meaning to them at all. That is until we arrange them in a very specific STRUCTURE\u2026a grammatical structure a syntax\u2026that is when things change from a random jumble of words into a meaningful statement.\n\nWell what linguists realize at this time is that this structure\u2026that underlies any meaningful statement\u2026 seems to be observable. We seem to be able to study it. We seem to be able to actually understand it and predict it. This premise is the starting point for what would eventually come to be known as structural linguistics.\n\nNow the thinkers that come immediately after Ferdinand De Saussure start to notice something. They start to notice that these structures\u2026appear to be everywhere\u2026not just in language. See,\u00a0it makes perfect sense to us to look at a sentence and realize that there is an underlying structure to language that makes it meaningful. Little bit more abstract of a concept to consider that there is an underlying structure to music\u2026or to a painting\u2026or to a work of literature. Little more abstract than that and these thinkers that take up Saussure\u2019s ideas start to notice that there seems to be a structure to economics, a structure to psychology, a structure to history, a structure to practically every field of inquiry there is. These structures seem to them to be almost like fingerprints left behind whenever you have any humanistic endeavor\u2026whenever any human being in history has tried to make sense of the infinite complexity of this universe that we live in, they do so by imposing these narrow structures that we humans can understand. And just like the structure that underlies language\u2026these structures are observable. These structures can be studied, understood and even predicted. This is a moment in history when a lot of fields of study that used to be considered part of the humanities turned into the social sciences. A science. There is a scientific, almost mathematical way that we can look at these structures that underly and ultimately determine the world we live in.\n\nNow ALL of this\u2026gets these thinkers to start looking at subjectivity in a very different way. Because think about the implications of this new approach that becomes known as structuralism. And I don\u2019t want to spoil any of the really exciting ideas that are to come on the next couple episodes of the show, so I\u2019ll keep this very general. Thinkers around this time are starting to consider things like: well if what gives the letters c-o-w meaning is just their relationship to thousands of other words within a larger structure\u2026if what makes the word cow meaningful is just the fact that it is not cat or horse or platypus. Maybe the meaning of what it is to be YOU\u2026is just the relationships between you and what it means to be the thousands of other people that surround you every day. Maybe the only thing that gives you your own sense of self-identity\u2026is just the fact that you\u2019re NOT Jared in the marketing department down the hall and everything that makes him what he is\u2026or Mariana the construction worker and what she is\u2026the subtle differences between the words c-o-w and c-a-t are comparable to the subtle differences between you and any of the others that surround you.\n\nBut these thinkers go further than that. When it comes to the metaphor of the eight word sentence that we talked about. There are practically an infinite number of potential sentences that you can construct. The individual words in those sentences can be scrambled an enormous number of ways, but it\u2019s not until they are in a very specific structure that they can work for us\u2026thinkers around this time are starting to ask: well there are practically an infinite number of possible cultures that can potentially exist\u2026a near infinite number of ways for human beings to chop up the universe and organize their societies in a meaningful way\u2026what if it\u2019s not until our cultures conform to a very specific structure that they allow society to function properly? That even though on the surface there seem to be massive differences between cultures, ultimately they all conform to the same narrow structure humans have used when desperately trying to make a society that not only functions, but one that we can comprehend. See that\u2019s the other side to this that the structuralists are going to point out\u2026there are no guarantees in nation building\u2026that it\u2019s possible to reject these structures that allow for society to function so much\u2026 that you create a world and a culture that human beings are incapable of navigating.\n\nWhen people started thinking about subjectivity and what it is to be you in these new structuralist terms\u2026the idea of subjectivity as we\u2019ve traditionally looked at it\u2026starts to dissolve away. What it starts to look like is that what it is to be you\u2026 is to be a single, instantiation of a culture, a culture with an extremely narrow structure that human beings imposed on the infinite complexity of the universe so that they could create a society that functions. Every thought you\u2019ve ever had\u2026every thought you WILL have in the future\u2026every bias, every preference, every moral intuition that you identify as a huge aspect of what it is to be you\u2026all of these are just stories that have been given to you by a culture that was structured in such ridiculously narrow terms that any claim that your view of the world is harnessing some level of objectivity about the way things are\u2026is just downright delusional. Where ELSE would you have gotten the contents of this thing you call your \u201cself\u201d, that in a very deterministic way this thing we think of as our \u201cself\u201d starts to dissolve, it starts to resemble just a fleeting revolving door of stories that we tell ourselves given to us by the time period and culture we happen to be in.\n\nThe BEST way to illustrate what we\u2019re talking about here, I think, is to remove you and me from the equation altogether and lets just think about ALL the other human beings that have existed throughout history. People in thirteenth century Europe. People in 9th century Baghdad. Why did these people have the view they did\u2026of who they were and where they fit into the world? Well these changes brought about by structuralism are happening right around the same time people are drastically rethinking the way that historians record what has happened throughout history\u2026and this change is relevant to this discussion.\n\nSee it was really common around this time, and you still see it in today\u2019s world to a certain extent, but it was really common for people to tell the story of history by talking about it in terms of leaders or governments acting out their will on the world around them. We\u2019ve all seen this before. You know\u2026when the story of human history is being told by talking about things like\u2026Hannibal invades Rome. Harun al-Rashid and Chinese government establish an alliance. Two world powers unite. Napoleon invades Russia\u2026the winter forces him back and then THIS treaty is signed by the government or THIS embargo is passed\u2026in other words: human history is often told solely in terms of what leaders and governments carried out over the years\u2026but historians start to realize that this is actually an extremely narrow lens to be telling the history of the world through. I mean, if you\u2019re a historian over the years it makes perfect sense\u2026you want an accurate account of what\u2019s happened in the past\u2026governments, generally speaking, keep good records. So if you\u2019re a historian you can actually go into the archives and see the signed document for when, for example, a declaration of war was signed or a treaty was agreed upon. But are these events a comprehensive picture of the history of the human species?\u00a0Why is the history of the human species any MORE Napoleon invading Russia than, for example, the evolution of what it is to be an average citizen of India from the 1100\u2019s to the 1400\u2019s\u2026or anything ELSE for that matter\u2026The point that\u2019s being made at this time in the early 20th century is: Aren\u2019t there countless other ways we could be telling the history of the world could be told, many of which having nothing to do with this small handful of powerful people changing the world to fit their image?\n\nNow this is not some sort of feel good point where they\u2019re trying to belittle the accomplishments of powerful people in the past\u2026This is more trying to get the conversation going of what sort of thinking does looking at our history like this produce? And what structuralists are going to say is that what this has inadvertently done is caused people when they\u2019re looking back at history to have a bias in their thinking towards the idea it\u2019s the subject that dictates what happens in the world. Not the world that dictates the subject.\n\nWhen Napoleon invades Russia\u2026there is a sense in which Napoleon is this autonomous subject with free will and is freely using that subjectivity to change history for everyone and invade Russia. But what if it was the other way around? What if instead of it being that Napoleon changed the world, what if the world created Napoleon and everything that he ever chose to do? What if instead of this old idea of subjectivity that dates all the way back to the Pre-Socratics\u2026that we\u2019re these autonomous subjects equipped with free will, tabula rasas\u2026instead of all that\u2026what if what it is to be a subject, what it is to be you, is to be a product produced by a particular narrow, practically microscopic, take on the universe given to you by your culture and time period.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about a specific example of this. There\u2019s a famous historian named Lucien Febvre who right around this time attempts to reconstruct what it would have been like to be a person living in France during the 16 century. He looks at everything from the social dynamics that existed at the time, the language that was being used, the nature of how people see their relationships with other people, even down to things like the way the average person would have perceived the concept of time\u2026 and one of the primary conclusions he arrives at after having done this\u2026is that if you were living in this society during the 1500s\u2026it would be absolutely impossible\u2026for you to ever be an Atheist. Not because your brain is incapable of grasping the concept that there isn\u2019t a God\u2026not that if we sent Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris back in a time machine they couldn\u2019t convince a few people. No, because of how deeply religious thinking pervades EVERYTHING to do with the way that you would have viewed your place in the world, because of how much you would frame EVERYTHING about your life in terms of its relationship to a deity\u2026in a very deterministic way\u2026you would just never arrive at the belief that there is no god. It would be completely impossible. The culture and time period that you are born into dictate the narrow parameters for what you can possibly think.\n\nNow you probably see where this is going for the structuralists. Do you think for one second that the culture you were born into is any different? That there aren\u2019t countless ideas that you will just never arrive at because of the narrow parameters of thought that your time period has set up for you that allow you to make sense of things? What ideas exist out there right now that no human has ever had access to because of these incredibly narrow ways that we make sense of things?\n\nBut even THAT question is filled with what structuralists would see as an old, delusional way of thinking about epistemology from the history of philosophy. There\u2019s this general idea that spans all throughout the Cartesian tradition all the way back to people like Plato\u2026it\u2019s this idea that we are these subjects, we think really hard, we reason about things and arrive at ideas that are out there in the ether somewhere. That as long as we stand in the Athenian agora and have conversations with Socrates for long enough\u2026there\u2019s no limit to the understanding we can have about the universe. This goes hand in hand with the enlightenment era notion that as long as we reason about things long enough and clearly enough\u2026there\u2019s the famous quote:\u00a0\u201cone day, the sun will shine over a humanity who acknowledge no other master than their own reason.\u201d That reason is capable of being successfully applied to all aspects of human life.\n\nBut seeing human beings through this traditional lens philosophy has viewed them through\u2026as these sort of open minded reasoning machines almost disinterestedly interpreting the world around them, that was on the way out\u2026this moment in the history of human thought seems like a changing of the guard to a lot of people\u2026how much does the environment you\u2019re born into and the language that you use every day dictate not only what you DO think\u2026but what you CAN think\u2026that as we\u2019ll see\u2026even when it comes to what seems reasonable to you at all\u2026reason itself\u2026is in many ways dictated by social forces and cultural morays that are almost impossible for the average person to see while they\u2019re immersed in it.\n\nThis whole shift\u2026not surprisingly comes on the heels of the initial work of the Frankfurt School. Remember the Frankfurt School was really into Freud and Marx as many thinkers are around this time. Well, Freud and Marx are often talked about as being sort of proto-structuralists. Freud for questioning the traditional idea that we\u2019re these totally free, autonomous subjects and accounting for the possibility that a lot of your behavior is based on unconscious drives that are out of your control\u2026and Marx\u2026Yet another example of one of Marx\u2019s ideas that later thinkers see as tremendously flawed, but overall, pretty much on the right track. Something called Marxist Superstructure Theory. Very briefly, Marx wants to challenge what he would see as a pretty naive picture of the world that when someone, for example, creates a work of art\u2026 that it is a free, uninhibited act of creation\u2026just total freedom painting itself onto the canvas. No, what he\u2019d say is that the kind of artwork that you produce is going to be massively dictated by something that was entirely out of your control: the economic and material reality that you were born into. The idea is that any authentic piece of artwork created by a worker and consumer is going to reflect the narrow set of values give"}, "episode_89": {"date": "2018-3-23", "text": "Posted on March 23, 2018\nEpisode 116 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #116 on Structuralism and Mythology. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo like we talked about last time, when structuralism bursts onto the scene in the early 20th century, there is an immediate shift in the way many thinkers view the traditional assumptions we\u2019ve made about subjectivity. The idea that what you are is a free acting, independent subject sort of disinterestedly taking in the universe exploring the infinite options at your disposal\u2026all of\u00a0 that starts to seem like an outdated, delusional way of viewing what it is to be a self. What it starts to look like is what you are\u2026every preference, every habit, every belief that you hold is merely an expression, of rituals and structures of a culture that you happen to be occupying during your time here. The self doesn\u2019t shape the world, the world shapes the self.\n\nNow this is usually easy for people to get on board with when it comes to the little things. For example, the gestures we use. Like you can point out to someone that they wave at people when they greet them\u2026and you can ask them: where exactly does that ritual come from? Where did you get the idea to move your hand back and forth at someone when you see them? I mean you didn\u2019t come out of the womb waving at everyone in the hospital\u2026and you\u2019re certainly not the person that came up with the idea of waving. No, what happened was you were born into a culture that has a particular set of rituals. There was a time in your life when you didn\u2019t know anything about waving, but after seeing people wave at you over and over again as a form of greeting, eventually you added waving to your bag of tricks and now it\u2019s just part of you\u2026it\u2019s what you do. If you were born into a different culture where waving wasn\u2019t a thing, you wouldn\u2019t have the slightest inclination at all to wave your hand in someones face when you greeted them.\n\nNow, practically no one sees that as a controversial statement to make. But people start to feel a little weird when a structuralist asks them, what if your taste in music is the same way? What if your favorite clothes and your favorite book and your favorite way to spend your evening are also just expressions of a culture you happened to be born into. What about your political viewpoints\u2026your moral code\u2026your views on the nature of existence, what if they\u2019re all the same way? To most people, these things feel very different than the cultural custom of waving\u2026and the idea that they\u2019ve just sort of picked these things up along the way\u2026these things feel like they make up the totality of what it is to be me\u2026see I\u2019ve always seen myself as sort of a blank slate that is an autonomous self\u2026I came into this universe knowing nothing about it\u2026and slowly but surely I\u2019m figuring the universe out\u2026and now you\u2019re telling me that every viewpoint and every preference that I have is really just me choosing from the rituals and structures of an incredibly narrow set of cultural parameters, set up not to be able to understand the universe but for the sake of monkeys being able to work together better? How did this happen?\n\nWell an early structuralist might respond by saying that it happened in many different ways. Still is happening, by the way\u2026your particular expression of the culture has already been reinforced to you probably hundreds of times just today\u2026and the interesting thing is: you would never see it happening if you weren\u2019t specifically looking for it\u2026 because, it lies underneath the world as you immediately perceive it at a surface level. But what happens when you look at things in the world around you through the lens of Semiotics?\n\nLet me slow down, real quick just to prime this discussion that we\u2019re about to have, one of the crucial things to remember from last time is that early structuralists are going to be following up on the work of Ferdinand De Sassure. De Sassure being the person credited with founding the field of Semiotics. Semiotics being the study of signs. Signs being things like words or pictures or many other things that act as a stand in for something else for the sake of us being able to communicate effectively. What we also talked about was how Ferdinand De Sassure saw each sign as being comprised of two primary parts: there\u2019s the signifier, which is the word or picture, the thing standing in for something else\u2026and then there\u2019s the signified, which is the concept of the thing the signifier is referencing.\n\nWell building from there\u2026 when early structuralists\u2026 started applying this Semiotic approach towards deconstructing signs in their respective fields of study\u2026what they start to realize is that communication is often not as simple as there being just a single signifier\u2026 attached to a single signified. It\u2019s not always as simple as our example from last time, there\u2019s the word \u201ccow\u201d and the concept of the four legged bovine creature in the field. That often times when we actually look at how signs are used in these complex fields of human study\u2026a single signifier\u2026can be attached to multiple different signifieds\u2026a single word or a single sentence\u2026may have a surface level meaning that it is trying to denote\u2026but, as it\u2019s often said\u2026there is a big difference between denotation and connotation\u2026that beneath a surface level reading of what a particular sign is seeming to communicate, there\u2019s often layers upon layers of different meanings\u2026 meanings that on one hand, allow the complexity of the universe to appear intelligible to us, but on the other hand drastically narrow and distort the way we see reality.\n\nLet\u2019s explain this further because it\u2019s THIS insight that early structuralists stumble upon\u2026 that makes many of them become interested in specifically using this new Semiotic approach towards understanding\u2026 Mythology at a deeper level\u2026and here\u2019s where they\u2019re coming from: what is the extent of the meaning that we can get out of a Mythological work? What I mean is\u2026you can look at mythology in a number of different ways:\u00a0There\u2019s a sense in which somebody could read a story from mythology, and they could interpret that story entirely at a surface level. Take Orphism and the mythology of ancient Greece for example. Somebody can read those stories\u2026and it is entirely possible for them to read them in a very surface level way\u2026and they may interpret what they read as just a fun story about a dysfunctional pantheon of gods.\u00a0Almost like this story is a sort of Wikipedia for these primitive people of Greece that NEEDED some mythology like this to explain things for them. Oh, this is a story about this guy Zeus up in the clouds, he has a bag full of lightning bolts, and here\u2019s another story about Poseidon\u2026God of the sea\u2026don\u2019t want to make him mad. In other words, there\u2019s a sense in which someone can read these stories and think that they\u2019re just stories\u2026 or some sort of outdated, fairy tale account of the way the universe is\u2026but there\u2019s another sense in which if you were to read mythology in this way\u2026you\u2019d be entirely missing the point, of mythology.\n\nThat the true value and meaning of mythology is not in that surface level story about Zeus and Poseidon\u2026no, there\u2019s a secondary message that\u2019s being delivered beneath the surface of the text, non-explicitly, and the onus is on the reader to interpret and understand that deeper message. Depending on the mythology you\u2019re reading, this message could be anything: it could be the origins of a particular group of people, the values of the culture in which the story is being written, take the story of Noah\u2019s Ark for example: somebody could read that story and interpret it entirely at a surface level: this is a story about some guy named Noah, God decides he\u2019s going to shake the etch a sketch and start over, so Noah needs to build an ark.\n\nBut another way of looking at that story is that the primary meaning for someone to take away from it is not in the denotation\u2026it\u2019s in the secondary story beneath the text, or in the language of Semiotics there\u2019s another layer of meaning that lies in an entirely different set of signifieds\u2026 that connect to the original signifiers\u2026 and that this isn\u2019t merely a story about a guy named Noah and an ark, there is a deeper meaning to this story that, for example, provides Christians with valuable insights about their relationship with God and how to be a good Christian\u2026but it potentially goes even deeper than that though\u2026maybe even deeper than the meaning it has for practicing Christians, there are messages written into this story that any human being alive can find value in. Some people might say\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t a story about a diety drowning everything on the planet at all\u2026that the mythological archetype of the \u201cflood\u201d is something that is not unique to this story\u2026it spans across many different cultures and\u00a0mythological works to symbolize, at a deeper level of this text, the cycle of death and rebirth that nature inevitably throws our way as human beings\u2026that anyone listening to this can come up with countless different ways that, tomorrow, nature could send some cataclysmic event our way that humanity would ostensibly want to survive, as we have throughout history, and that this story is something that can inform that process. That maybe it\u2019s not literally about a guy named Noah that sacrifices animals to God to earn his favor, maybe that process of sacrifice, at a deeper level of this story, is depicting how personal sacrifice is the only thing that can temper you into the kind of person that isn\u2019t instantly ruined by events that test you and are out of your control. Maybe it\u2019s not about building a boat\u2026maybe building the boat is a metaphor for building the means by which you\u2019re going to survive this cataclysmic event before it actually happens. Now even if this is a horrible take on Noah\u2019s Ark, you can understand the point here. Often times within mythology there are multiple signifieds attached to the original signifiers. There are the actual words that tell a very surface level story, but to only read it at that level would be missing out on a lot of the intended meaning of the work that lies, in a sense, beneath the surface level text.\n\nNow this is an extremely obvious point to us when it comes to mythology and things that clearly are written with a deeper meaning in mind\u2026but the really important thing many structuralists would say we should all remember here: consider the possibility that you can go every single day of your life\u2026 reading mythology just at that very surface level\u2026never realizing all the other layers there are\u2026the reason this is so important to US in particular is because, you know\u2026 there\u2019s this very modern idea that\u2019s pretty popular, that as a species, when it comes to mythology\u2026we\u2019re pretty much past all that. Mythology\u2019s this thing people used to do a long time ago to be able to explain the way the world is\u2026but in today\u2019s world we have much more advanced and sophisticated ways of talking about things and quite frankly we don\u2019t have to resort to these archaic methods used in mythology that are obviously distorted, obviously oversimplified, we\u2019re past that as a species.\n\nWell one of the early structuralists by the name of Roland Barthes is going to say that the idea that we are in some sort of post-mythological age is complete and utter nonsense. See, to Barthes, mythology\u2026is an extremely human thing to create and be engaged in\u2026we do it all the time whether we realize it or not\u2026and it\u2019s not that mythology no longer exists in our modern world\u2026it\u2019s that the average person is so immersed within the mythology, the culture and our daily lives so saturated with a hidden, secondary story telling us the way the world is\u2026that much like an average citizen of ancient Greece that might see a lightning bolt and confidently attribute that to Zeus\u2026we do the very same sort of thing with our world and our mythology. And just like it\u2019s possible to go your whole life reading the mythology of ancient Greece at a very basic, surface level\u2026you can go your entire life in our modern world interpreting everything that you see around you at a surface level, never realizing the deeper, secondary level story that you\u2019re blindly accepting as \u201cjust the way the world is.\u201d\n\nSee Roland Barthes would say, again\u2026it\u2019s not that mythology doesn\u2019t exist in our modern world\u2026it\u2019s that the delivery method of it has changed. Most people aren\u2019t going to some giant book filled with epic poetry about a pantheon of gods to get their mythology in this day and age\u2026no, to Roland Barthes, the mythology of OUR world\u2026 is typically delivered to people through mass media. Because really consider the similarities between the two mediums when you look at them through the lens of semiotics like these early structuralists did\u2026a dusty, old tome that contains mythology\u2026 is really just a vast collection of signs\u2026hundreds of pages of signifiers that denote a surface level meaning but that also have multiple layers of signifieds attached to them that it\u2019s the reader\u2019s job to interpret\u2026well the same thing is the case with the media we consume. For example, take your average TV news broadcast in today\u2019s world\u2026for the sake of the example, if it\u2019s possible within your own political beliefs, picture the news broadcast you most disagree with, whether it\u2019s CNN, Fox News, doesn\u2019t matter\u2026well what is that news broadcast REALLY when you look at it using Semiotics? Well, it\u2019s just a vast collection of signs\u2026signs that on one level deliver a surface message of reporting the news of the day\u2026but as you can see when you really analyze the specific signs and the calculated ways that CNN or Fox News are using them\u2026there\u2019s often layers of mythology not being explicitly stated\u2026and this mythology spans from things that are seemingly innocent like messages that reinforce their credibility as a news source\u2026to messages that make value judgments about whose opinions should be taken seriously, all the way to mythology that makes brazen assumptions about what it even is to exist\u2026all of these messages\u2026 shaping, distorting and narrowing people\u2019s views on the way the world is.\n\nPicture the typical signs that are presented to people in a news broadcast. And now the five o\u2019clock news. Sweeping camera shot, there\u2019s music playing with a lot of beeping or a sense of urgency about it\u2026Roland Barthes would really want us to ask ourselves, why is it that music in particular? What deeper story is being delivered to people there through that music? More signs are delivered to us: the camera brings into view a big room with two people sitting behind a desk dressed up in respectable clothes\u2026why the desk? Why those clothes in particular? Why do they have incredible posture? Why is that giant picture behind them, why are they looking directly into the camera lens as though they\u2019re looking you in the eye when they give you the news, why do they talk in a very specific, articulation and diction that is the way that somebody talks when they deliver you the news? See everything about the five o\u2019clock news that\u2019s being presented to you is a vast collection of signs, and just like classic mythology, this combination of signs can be taken at a surface level and just glossed over, but to look at the news that way would be missing out on a lot of deeper stories that are being told to the viewers non-explicitly. Roland Barthes would say that peppered throughout this entire broadcast\u2026is a mythology that\u2019s being communicated to you that what these people on the television screen are telling you is total, unmediated reality.\n\nBarthes would want to break it down even further though, even down to details that may seem completely insignificant at a surface level\u2026for example, what\u2019s with all the scrolling text? Really, why is it that scrolling text is so popular on programs that deliver the news? Is it just a really efficient way of delivering a message to people? Or does the scrolling of the text add a little something to the way we perceive the information? For example, does scrolling text look a little more like an official bulletin that people should take seriously? Does it add to the viewer a feeling that the information is hot off the press because look, it just came into existence on the left side of my screen a couple seconds ago and I better read it because it\u2019s not gonna be around for long! Roland Barthes would say that we often look at the font of a message as sort of just a disinterested vehicle for delivering that message\u2026but in reality, he would say, the font that something is written in\u2026 adjusts and changes the meaning of what its conveying. There\u2019s a very good reason the newspaper isn\u2019t written in comic sans. And understanding why that is\u2026understanding the deeper mythology there that\u2019s brought to bear even when it comes to something as seemingly insignificant as the font that\u2019s being used, can help us understand the goal of Roland Barthes during this portion of his career when he\u2019s analyzing mass media. That is: to demystify culture for the average viewer.\n\nWe have been collectively mystified by this mythology that exists in media, and it\u2019s mystified us by doing what Barthes says it\u2019s so effective at doing: mythology transforms history into nature. And what he means by that is, look Barthes is an anti-essentialist. To him there is no such thing as some essential \u201cway the world is\u201d that we\u2019re accessing through media\u2026or at least no validity when people say essentialist things like \u201cthat\u2019s just the way people are\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s just the way Americans are\u201d or any number of countless examples you could bring up. What mythology does is turn history into nature, it takes these cultural constructions, like for example the idea of \u201chow americans are\u201d\u2026a construction that is ultimately arbitrary and completely contingent upon history, or what happens to have transpired in the past\u2026and mythology gets people to look at that construction as though it\u2019s a fixed, unchanging part of nature\u2026as though the way that you look at the world and make sense of it is \u201cjust the way the world is\u201d.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing\u2026back to CNN and Fox News for a second\u2026 Barthes would say there are a lot of people out there that are really good at spotting the mythology of people they disagree with\u2026but when you ask them about their OWN worldview\u2026oh, well my views are just the way the world is. That just goes without saying. Barthes says it\u2019s right there that you\u2019re always going to find mythology. Whenever someone says something like \u201cit goes without saying\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just the way the world is\u201d\u2026that\u2019s always an area where someone is loaded up with mythological baggage that they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re carrying around with them.\n\nThis is the crucial point to understand about this mythology.\u00a0The goal is not to do away with mythology\u2026 or become a person that looks at the world in a way devoid of mythology\u2026to many structuralists, you can\u2019t escape mythology\u2026to have an understanding of this universe at all is to have a mythology that you subscribe to that gives you a yes, narrow, but at least comprehensible picture that if you never thought about it may seem to you like just \u201cthe way the world is\u201d. The goal isnt to get rid of the mythology but to demystify your own personal mythology so that you can see it for what it actually is.\n\nWhat he ALSO wants people to realize through this is that when you look at mass media through the lens of semiotics, what becomes immediately obvious to you is how quickly we move, as he says, from Semiology to Ideology. Semiology is the original name Ferdinand De Sassure wanted to use, but it\u2019s more popularly known as Semiotics. What Barthes is saying is that when you use Semiotics to uncover these second and third level meanings hidden in media, what you find is almost always mythology that promotes a particular political ideology, and by \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d he\u2019s not just talking about liberal vs. conservative, his scope is much broader, by political he means any message that aims to change something about the world in some way\u2026so this is not just CNN or Fox News doing this stuff, but advertisements, books, YouTube channels, podcasts, practically every, input we receive from the media landscape.\u00a0To Barthes, the entire world around you is a mythological work that needs to be interpreted\u2026and when you can spot the mythology that underlies even the most seemingly innocent things in media you can start to see all of the assumptions we bring to the table that have massive effects on the way the average person thinks, behaves, votes, the way they structure their viewpoint of reality.\n\nNow I want to repeat this because I want to make sure this is entirely clear\u2026what Barthes is NOT doing here is telling people\u2026hey when you\u2019re watching TV\u2026if you pay attention\u2026 you can spot people in media that say things that are politically biased! Be careful for all that mythology they might throw your way!\n\nNo he\u2019s actually saying something much more fundamental and extraordinary than that. What he\u2019s saying is\u2026 when you use Semiotics to look at this mythology hidden within media, if you dig deep enough\u2026this mythology\u2026 is an entry point towards exhuming the deep rooted, underlying structures, that make up our culture, the structures that allow our culture to function at all.\n\nLet me say that another way, what Barthes is uncovering is the very structure, of our culture and what makes it work. He\u2019s uncovering the oversimplified stories we tell ourselves every day\u2026that act as the fabric that holds society together. Remember last episode when we were talking about how language and words only work when they\u2019re arranged in a very specific structure? Well many structuralists believed that culture worked the same way, that as human beings we formulate cultures using the exact same patterns we use to formulate languages. That like every language, every culture has a complex arrangement of social structures that allow society to function. Barthes, by using Semiotics to dissect the media we consume and get to the mythology that\u2019s being implied but not said, what he\u2019s actually uncovering there are the various structures of culture that most people never notice are there. Barthes would say, the same way you can easily talk to people all day long and make sentences and you don\u2019t necessarily need to understand Semiotics or the complexities of grammar to be able to do that\u2026you can be engaged in this mythology, with every viewpoint that you have, and you can be completely unaware of the narrow cultural structures that lie underneath the stuff that you\u2019re watching. This is what Barthes means when he says he wants to \u201cdemystify culture\u201d for people. He wants to show people culture for what it truly is.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about several specific examples that Barthes gives. Now we could immediately dive into the obviously coercive mythology, but I think one of the best places to start, just because it\u2019s such a normal, everyday part of the way we navigate existence, is to talk about the mythology that pervades the way the average person looks at soap.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. Soaps and detergents. Bear with me for this example, I promise it will make sense\u2026here\u2019s where he\u2019s coming from: when you look at the denotation of soap, what is it really? Well on a surface level it\u2019s just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles. But we don\u2019t see it as just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles, do we?\n\nBarthes says in a sort of tongue in cheek way, there\u2019s a spirituality that comes along with soap, a mythology that we\u2019ve added on\u00a0to those clean smelling bubbles that affect the way we think about how soap fits into our lives\u2026and we can see all of this extra meaning we tack onto soap when we look at the way advertisers try to sell it to us. Think of the language that\u2019s often used when describing soap\u2026we almost see it as this holy weapon that we\u2019re using to fight against the demon of uncleanliness\u2026.and advertisers will talk about soap using language that makes it sound like a weapon\u2026this weapon cuts through dirt like a sword\u2026destroys grunge and grime at the source almost like some sort of cleaning artillery\u2026tackles any mess with ease using our patented \u201cfoaming cleanser\u201d\u2026we actually talk about cleansing away filth the same way someone of a different culture and time may talk about cleansing a house of an evil spirit\u2026think of the images on the TV screen of the dinner plate half dirty with food all over it, half glistening white, or on a deeper level, half tainted by this evil curse known as \u201cfilth\u201d and dirtiness\u2026and half restored to the rightful, natural state of purity that it belongs in, that this soap has delivered to you. The idea that we accept there being: look, there are going to be times in your life\u2026 when evil rears its ugly head\u2026filth and dirtiness are going to corrupt the things you care about in your life\u2026maybe it\u2019s your kitchen table, maybe it\u2019s your clothes, maybe it\u2019s your car, but eventually, the time will come that you need to take this soap\u2026this soap that kills 99.9% of bacteria\u2026 and you need to carry out a bacteria holocaust in your kitchen to cleanse your life and restore it to a state of purity. Soap will get you there. Forged in the crucible of the Pine Sol factory\u2026your kitchen table\u2019s deliverance from the corruption of filth awaits you down at the grocery store.\n\nNow this sounds completely ridiculous when we use these words and talk about it as though it is some sort of religious cleansing, but that doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t the way the utility of soap functions in our daily lives. Barthes would say the fact we always talk about soap in standard, everyday language is a big part of the reason we\u2019re capable of normalizing the way we use soap, never noticing all the mythology we attach to it, and just accepting it as, again, just \u201cthe way the world is\u201d. But here\u2019s the reality, he would say: the way we look at soap\u2026is not as just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles\u2026things in my life that matter to me get dirty, and soap is the catalyst by which I return those things to their rightful, clean place where they belong! In other words\u2026there seems to be a way that we STRUCTURE our lives by looking at things in terms of whether they are clean or dirty, and most of us gladly accept, that that\u2019s just the way the world is. Remember that structure for next episode, but the point here is not to criticize soap, or the people who use soap\u2026the point is to show people how even with something as simple as soap, there is this entirely different level of signifieds, a deeper level of meaning that we attach to clean smelling bubbles that certainly helps us navigate our lives, but that meaning doesn\u2019t say anything necessarily true about those bubbles objectively.\n\nNow some of you out there might be saying\u2026ok, who cares?\u2026it\u2019s soap\u2026.and I get it\u2026it IS just soap\u2026the stakes are not exactly life threatening here\u2026but they\u2019re not supposed to be\u2026that is the whole strategy! Talking about something as benign and politically uncharged as soap\u2026is Barthes using an extremely obvious, uncontroversial example just to illustrate to anyone that this mythology exists. So now that we know it does exist, let\u2019s talk about examples of how this mythology can be enormously helpful or horribly damaging to people, sometimes simultaneously. Probably the most famous example is when Roland Barthes uses semiotics to give an analysis of professional wrestling.\n\nNow by professional wrestling, he\u2019s not talking about greco-roman or olympic wrestling\u2026he\u2019s talking about stuff like the WWE\u2026big dudes in speedos beating each other with chairs\u2026screaming at each other\u2026pretending to writhe in pain on the ground\u2026the outcome is planned before the start of the match\u2026somebody could look at professional wrestling and ask the question unless if you\u2019re into this stuff, who outside of a seven year old kid could possibly get any value out of this? But Barthes would say if that\u2019s really the way you\u2019re looking at wrestling, you\u2019re entirely missing the point of wrestling. Once again, let\u2019s all notice the pattern here: the people that look at the media landscape, and for that matter the world around them at an entirely at a basic, surface level, are going to be missing out on a lot of deeper meaning that\u2019s not obvious\u2026looking at wrestling this way is this is the equivalent of reading Greek Mythology and just thinking it\u2019s a story about Zeus and Poseidon. The true meaning that people are connecting with when they\u2019re watching professional wrestling has nothing to do with the surface level of guys beating each other with chairs\u2026the mistake that someone\u2019s making if they see it that way is that they\u2019re looking at wrestling as though the point of it is for there to actually be a competition, when in reality wrestling is a spectacle, that\u2019s goal is to deliver very specific messages to people about morality.\n\nTo show why this is the case, he compares boxing and wrestling. The purpose of a boxing match, is to figure out who the best boxer is. You\u2019d never writhe in pain on the ground if someone punched you. You\u2019d never be losing a boxing match and then decide you\u2019re going to leave the ring, get a chair, beat your opponent senseless with it, then get up on the high rope with their lifeless body and body slam them into a Buick parked next to the stage. You just wouldn\u2019t do that because a big part of a boxing match is that the rules dictate who wins the boxing match. When it comes to wrestling, Barthes says the only reason why the rules are there is to serve as guidelines to be broken by whoever the bad guy is. I mean really, the only reason the rules even exist is to inspire outrage in the crowd when they\u2019re broken. Wrestling is not a sport, it is a drama. The wrestlers are all characters, huge people, cartoonishly huge at times, characters thrown into playing moral roles that deliver a wide variety of messages to people, one of the major recurring ones being that justice is being delivered in the world. The bad guy may win. He may get away with what he\u2019s doing five times, ten times\u2026but there\u2019s always going to be that day when the bad guy gets his comeuppance. Barthes would say that a big part of what people are communicating with is the fact that bad people do exist out there\u2026but here\u2019s proof, in some way, that law and order and justice are still being delivered in this crazy world.\n\nNow this function within culture has been served by many other things all throughout history. Public executions. Did the human beings of the past hang people and chop off their heads in the public square because people are sadistic and just really like watching people die? Or does the cultural ritual of justice being carried out in public on criminals help keep people voluntarily participating in this chaotic game that involves us banding together for mutual benefit? So in that sense, this mythology delivered to people by professional wrestling, is part of the very fabric that holds culture together, you could say if you were foreshadowing to next episode that it\u2019s a very small part of a much larger structure that holds society together. Barthes likes wrestling in particular because yes, it\u2019s fake, yes, it\u2019s delivering mythology to people, but at least it doesn\u2019t pretend like it\u2019s anything other than that\u2026 like so many other programs out there do.\n\nNow at first glance it seems great that something as simple as professional wrestling is delivering messages to people that help hold society together. That definitely seems like a good thing, but Barthes would strongly suggest that we take a second and think about the potential downsides of something like that. Hypothetically, you can use media to deliver to people a message that helps hold society together, much to the detriment of society. Barthes would say, picture someone in a place of enormous political power, a politician. Maybe they have a friend that owns a media company too. How easy would it be for that person\u2026 to create a show that delivers to people this message that law and order and justice are being carried out in the world around them, just as a cover so that the politician and their friends at the top levels of government can rake the citizenry over the coals, rob them blind, destroy the country and never have to face any sort of meaningful outrage from people, because most of the population have been sold this marketing campaign that they\u2019re living in a just country? What if in reality, the purpose of public executions was to terrify anyone into submission, who might otherwise dare to rebel against the status quo?\n\nWhen you\u2019re clever enough to deliver to people a mythology\u2026 that gets people to confidently say something as reductionist as, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way the world is a"}, "episode_90": {"date": "2018-3-23", "text": "Posted on March 23, 2018\nEpisode 117 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #117 on Structuralism and Mythology. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo just to start I want to rephrase something we talked about a couple episodes ago because I think it\u2019s important to frame our discussion here today: there are practically an infinite number of possible combinations of words that you can cobble together and read, but it wouldn\u2019t be until those words adhered to a very specific, underlying structure that they would work or have any semblance of meaning to anyone at all. Language has a structure, and we can observe this structure, we can study this structure and if you\u2019re a structural linguist you may be able to predict how that structure is going to change in the future. Well to many of these thinkers that follow up with the methods proposed by Ferdinand De Saussure, what it seems like to them is that culture\u2026 has a specific, underlying structure as well\u2026and when Barthes uses Semiotics to study mass media and get to the mythology that lies underneath the surface level, this is one of the first attempts to gain access to that underlying structure of culture, SO that we can observe it, so that we can study it and yes, looking at culture almost in a new, scientific way to try to be able to predict cultural changes that will occur in the future before they actually happen.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the way, if any of this mythology business seems a little bit conspiratorial to you\u2026consider the fact that practically everyone listening to this knows how it feels to engage in this process\u2026most people these days are media practitioners that are in the business of promoting their own personal mythology. We just do it on a slightly different form of media than Barthes is talking about\u2026social media. Now even if you don\u2019t, you can at least relate to how the average person\u2019s Facebook or Instagram looks. Someone\u2019s Facebook page isn\u2019t a total and accurate representation of who they are\u2026it becomes sort of like a museum dedicated to the person they want other people to think they are, of which they are the sole curator.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThink about the mythology that\u2019s present there\u2026they\u2019ll post a picture of themselves smiling on top of a mountain they just hiked, right after posting a picture of them eating their avocado toast on a park bench, right before a picture of them boarding a plane, caption reads: hey guys just boarding the plane, won\u2019t be able to respond for a few hours! The point is, these pictures weren\u2019t chosen because they wanted to deliver a surface level denotation of what\u2019s actually going on in the pictures, they were chosen because it promotes a narrative\u2026maybe it\u2019s that I\u2019m the kind of person that lives an exciting life where I travel around to interesting places\u2026or I\u2019m the kind of person that eats avocado toast, I eat foods that are trendy, healthy yet surprisingly portable and as you can see I\u2019m in the park so I\u2019m not the kind of person that squanders that portability of my avocado toast\u2026Who am I? Well you can tell by looking at my pictures\u2026you know that person you\u2019ll sometimes see, the sun glistening off their perfectly clear skin and beautiful white smile as they sit on a park bench enjoying not only this moment, but their avocado toast as well? That\u2019s the kind of person I am\u2026it\u2019s funny, someone just snapped a random picture they happened to catch me here. Of all places.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow while this is just one example of it\u2026no matter what mythological tale you\u2019re weaving for people on social media, the reality is: your actual life is far more complex than the story you tell to people on social media. You\u2019re not always smiling, there are countless things going on in your life that you would never include on there, and here\u2019s the point: you can imagine if someone you didn\u2019t know.. just took the story you told about yourself on social media as a complete picture of what it is to be you, all they\u2019d really have a very narrow picture of a mythology that you\u2019ve produced, I mean you certainly wouldn\u2019t say this person has an understanding of who you are at your deepest level. Well, so too with mythology about the world that media produces, just imagine if the universe had a Facebook page. Your understanding of it would be tantamount to one of the stories people tell about themselves on their individual Facebook page. To an early structuralist, your own individual worldview is not a deep understanding of the universe\u2026it\u2019s an expression of a cultural norm\u2026it is as much an expression of a cultural norm as a handshake is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow you may be wondering, if we can observe and study these cultural structures, when you\u2019re observing them\u2026what exactly do they look like? Well that\u2019s what the last half of this episode is going to be about\u2026what I think is crucial for us to do before we get there is to talk about a few more examples of Barthes using Semiotics to break down specific examples of this mythology that\u2019s rooted in media. Each of these examples revealing a little bit more of these structures that underly culture, and each of them, when we look at the tactics used to deliver the mythology, these examples can help us understand how these messages are delivered to people in ways that you wouldn\u2019t realize it was being delivered to you unless if you were deliberately looking for it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about soap and how we organize the things in our life in terms of a constant fight between clean vs. dirty. We\u2019ve talked about professional wrestling and how messages of justice can be part of the fabric that holds society together, sometimes to the detriment of society. One thing any good mythological work is going to have are people with some sort of exalted status in the eyes of the public\u2026 people that act as examples for the average person to look up to or examples of what people should avoid doing because look at what happened to this person in mythology that did that\u2026these could take the form of demi-gods, epic warriors, fallen angels\u2026but in our mythology we give this status to people that possess this strange thing we call celebrity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBarthes would say\u2026 that there\u2019s a mythology thats constantly being delivered to you in media\u2026that these people we call celebrities, are not like you. They\u2019re better than you are. And this message often leads people when navigating their personal life\u2026 to exalt some celebrity onto a pedestal, and then look up to them as an example to emulate, often times leading the average person to have extreme reverence for their opinions on things that, most of the time, the celebrity\u2019s really completely unqualified to talk about in the first place. But nonetheless there\u2019s this undeniable FEELING that this person\u2019s just different from you\u2026they\u2019re BETTER than you are, let\u2019s listen to them! Where does that come from?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBarthes might point to something like when TMZ runs a photo spread of Leonardo Di Caprio walking down the street eating a hot dog\u2026what do they always do? They probably do some headline referencing one of his movies\u2026what\u2019s eating gilbert grape? I don\u2019t know but his brother leo is eating a hotdog walking down the street enjoying a sunday afternoon. The denotation of these pictures would be Leonardo De Caprio walking down the street eating a hotdog. The connotation somebody may take away from that might be that, \u201cHey look! Leonardo De Caprio is just a regular guy like me! Look, he\u2019s wearing a Dodgers hat! I too wear an LA Dodgers hat. I too have found myself on occasion walking down the street eating a hotdog. That\u2019s so cool, he\u2019s just a regular guy!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Barthes would say the mythology\u2026 the story that\u2019s being told at a deeper level there\u2026is that it\u2019s a newsworthy event when Leonardo De Caprio walks down the street eating a hot dog. The very fact, that the news of the day for you is that Leo is eating a hotdog like a normal person, deifies him and draws attention to the fact that he\u2019s not just a normal person. This is an interesting type of this mythology and it\u2019s a good example of how flexible and hard to spot it can be if you aren\u2019t specifically looking for it\u2026a collection of signs can seem to be delivering one message on the surface, when the mythology connected to those signs is actually implying the exact opposite of that message.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow this mythology affects things far more influential on people\u2019s lives than Leo and a hotdog. One example of when this TYPE of mythology is used is when people are running for president. Think of all the pageantry that surrounds a presidential election cycle with the sole purpose to simultaneously deliver to people the message that this person running for president is just like you\u2026but they\u2019re also, nothing like you at all. The candidate makes sure they know which crowd their speaking to so that they can dress like you except they roll up their sleeves because they\u2019re ready to get to work. They\u2019ll play up connections they have to your career or your geographic area so it\u2019s like you both come from the same place. They\u2019ll look you in the eye and tell you that your family matters to them and that you two are the same kind of people because you share a common vision for the direction the country should be headed in. But there\u2019s also a sense in which this whole display that is taking place, them standing at a podium speaking to a crowd in a very artificial voice, people waving signs with their name in big, bold letters, they say things in a way that slows down at the end and accentuates so that they can get applause. There\u2019s a sense in which they want you to feel like this person is nothing like you. That this is not just any ordinary person in front of you\u2026this person is better than you. This person is presidential, whatever that means \u2026in other words this is someone to be exalted within our culture and looked up to. To many early structuralists, having figures within society that we exalt in this way is part of the recipe for the way we structure culture that makes it work.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Barthes is doing his work in post WW2 France, so many of the specific collections of signs that he analyzes have to do with the political climate of that particular time in French history. One of the most famous examples of his analysis is when he takes a Semiotic approach towards understanding the cover of a magazine called Paris Match\u2026the cover of this magazine in particular depicted a black soldier, dressed in a French military uniform standing at attention and saluting.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe denotation there is of a black soldier saluting. The connotation someone might draw from that ranges considerably, but the deeper mythology that Barthes claims is being stated here\u2026 he works out when he sees the magazine for the first time in a barber shop:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am at the barber\u2019s, and a copy of Paris-Match is offered to me. On the cover, a young black soldier in a French uniform is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably fixed on a fold of the tricolour. All this is the meaning of the picture. But whether naively or not, I see very well what it signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under the flag, and that there is no better answer to the detractors of an alleged colonialism than the zeal shown by this black soldier in serving his so-called oppressors.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat he\u2019s talking about is after WW2 ends the French Colonial Empire is still a thing. Mass protests by the colonized populations and the violence France used to keep them under control had a lot of people calling into question whether what they were doing was ethical. Barthes says what they\u2019re doing when they run a cover of a magazine like that is to present a mythology of: look! Here\u2019s a citizen of one of our African colonies dressed up in a French uniform proudly saluting the French flag. People complaining about the colonies\u2026can\u2019t you see what we are? We are France! A sprawling, powerful empire made even more powerful by this multicultural military force that all proudly serve the cause of French imperialism, all of these other cultures we colonize happily saluting the ultimate symbol of Frenchness\u2026the French flag. All of this, a mythology delivered to the viewer that takes French imperialism and the agony of the colonized people, sweeps it under the rug and turns it into just the way the world is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBarthes would say the cover of this magazine is a collection of signs. Signifiers that denote a surface meaning, but signifieds that deliver second level messages like the concepts of Frenchness, the goodness of French imperialism, the presence of multiculturalism, there being a unified population with equal rights\u2026and when the viewer of the magazine receives this mythology, when coming up with the way they view the world, they\u2019ll often times accept these things as nature\u2026or just the way the world is. Barthes says:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor the myth-reader [i.e., the believer of myth] the outcome is quite different: everything happens as if the picture naturally conjured up the concept, as if the signifier gave a foundation to the signified: the myth exists from the precise moment when French imperiality achieves the natural state\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Barthes, this is the whole point of mythology. To turn history into nature. To turn things that are arbitrary and historical into \u201cthe Truth\u201d. To turn the politically motivated into \u201cjust the way that things are\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, here\u2019s an extremely important point that is going to be crucial in understanding the problems post-structuralists are going to have with mythology. Any mythology that is politically motivated\u2026in the sense that it is trying to change the world in some way\u2026can\u2019t help but smuggle in with that mythology an entire set of values that people receiving the mythology often mistakenly interpret as fact\u2026or again, just the way the world is\u2026.and remember, when he says politically motivated, Barthes is not just talking about a narrow conception of that in the form of liberal vs. conservative\u2026but about ANY thing that seeks to change something about the way the world is. Barthes says:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAny semiological system is a system of values; now, the myth-consumer takes the signification for a system of facts: myth is read as a factual system, whereas it is but a semiological system.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBarthes says that often times when these values are smuggled in\u2026it can get otherwise perfectly decent people\u2026 to participate in systems or behaviors that only a monster would participate in if they were self aware of how much mythological baggage they carry around with them. Building on the example of French Colonialism, Barthes might talk about the mythology connected to wine in French culture. Wine is seen as this ultimate, panacea of a drink. Wine is what he calls a social equalizer. No matter what economic class you come from we\u2019re all friends when we\u2019re drinking wine! Wine makes the person that\u2019s really shy come out of their shell and be more talkative\u2026while at the same time, with the person that talks too much\u2026calms them down and lets them relax. When it\u2019s winter time, wine is seen as this thing that you drink and it warms you up. During the summer, wine is associated with sitting in the shade sipping a nice cold glass. There\u2019s not much talk about the negative effects of wine, how many people it kills every year, how many families it destroys, the normalization of purposefully putting a neurotoxin in your body\u2026no all that death is overlooked and wine is seen as something you do when you want to feel more alive\u2026when you want to \u201clive a little\u201d. But these aren\u2019t the only negative effects of wine that the mythology allows people to overlook. Barthes says:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cthe mythology of wine can in fact help us to understand the usual ambiguity of our daily life. For it is true that wine is a good and fine substance, but it is no less true that its production is deeply involved in French capitalism, whether it is that of the private distillers or that of the big settlers in Algeria who impose on the Muslims, on the very land of which they have been dispossessed, a crop of which they have no need, while they lack even bread. There are thus very engaging myths which are however not innocent. And the characteristic of our current alienation is precisely that wine cannot be a blissful substance, except if we wrongfully forget that it is also the product of an expropriation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Barthes, the mythology connected to wine that gets delivered to people through media creates their subjectivity, and with it the ideas they have about what it is to be a French person and what your relationship with alcohol looks like. And this mythology allows people to engage in a behavior that has what Barthes sees as horribly unethical practices associated with it\u2026and they can use this mythology to transform what would otherwise be ethically wrong into an innocent expression of their \u201cFrenchness\u201d. I\u2019m French\u2026we drink a lot of wine. This is just how we are. This is just what we do. This is just the way the world is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo bring this to modern day, Barthes at this point in his career, would see the exact same thing in many of the ways people look at what it is to be an American. For example, if drinking wine is an integral part of the mythology associated with what it is to be a person from France\u2026to be an American is in some small way to be someone that every once in a while has a burger. Fourth of July comes around and what do you do? You get out the BBQ\u2026invite the family over\u2026grill up some burgers and eat one with the family. No one would judge you for doing that\u2026that\u2019s just the way the world is. That\u2019s just what it is to be an American. Barthes would say our subjectivity about what it is to be an American, being engaged in that mythology, makes it possible for otherwise perfectly decent people to not even consider where that meat came from, statistically speaking, from factory farming situations that most people participating in the activity of eating a burger wouldn\u2019t want to patronize or endorse. But nonetheless, the mythology of what it is to be an American kept them doing it without them even realizing they were hurting anyone. What other things about what it is to be an American historically are hurting people around you unbeknownst to you? Same question for whatever country you\u2019re listening to this from.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis same dynamic applies to things that extend beyond nationality though. Say a big part of your subjectivity or how you view yourself requires you to dress in a specific style of clothes\u2026maybe you\u2019re really into shoes\u2026whatever it is. Say you\u2019re a surfer dude. Part of the mythology of being a surfer dude is wearing some totally bodacious surfer dude clothes bro. And dude, what if when you go down to the store to buy your surfer clothes. Bro, what if they were made by people that work in abject, miserable conditions in a third world country? What if it would absolutely horrify you to know that you were contributing to something like that, but the mythology you\u2019ve received your whole life through media that makes up what it is to be you has had you thinking about wearing those clothes as just \u201cwhat it is to be a surfer dude\u201d \u201cthis is just the way the world is.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo now that we\u2019ve talked about several examples of it hopefully it\u2019s a little easier to see the similarities between the mythology of ancient Greece and the mythology we still use in today\u2019s world. Maybe a good visual to use when thinking about structuralism is to think of Plato\u2019s cave.\n\nThere are the shadows on the cave wall. There are the puppets behind the people casting the shadows and there are the actual human beings that watch the shadows on the cave wall and mistake it for reality. Well let\u2019s use that visual to think of structuralism: think of the shadows on the cave wall as the distorted, narrow worldview given to someone by mass media and the culture they live in\u2026this worldview that structures reality into something comprehensible, let\u2019s them navigate existence. They often mistakenly think of these shadows as \u201cjust the way the world is.\u201d Think of the puppets casting the shadows as being the unmediated reality that we don\u2019t have access to. Well what lies in between those two things? What makes the worldview on the cave wall that people often mistake as unmediated reality possible? Well to a structuralist, the answer is: the structures that human beings use to derive meaning from that unmediated reality. The structure of language. The structure of economics. The structure of culture in all its parts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo a structural anthropologist by the name of Claude Levi-Strauss, he would say that it is absolutely fitting in this example that human beings are the only things in between unmediated reality and their worldviews on the cave wall. To Levi-Strauss, human culture, human behavior, your personal views on how you fit into all of this, all of this is really just a reflection of the underlying structures of the human mind and the way it interfaces with reality, and these structures of the human mind are ultimately what is dictating everything about the way that we arrive at these worldviews. And when Levi-Strauss starts to study these structures within culture, what he notices is that the way the human mind seems to make sense of everything, is by thinking of things in the world in terms of dichotomies. Some structuralists call these dichotomies nebular oppositions, but by far the most common term used to describe these is that the human mind makes sense of reality in terms of binary oppositions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome very simple examples of these binary oppositions are things like up vs. down, left vs right, in vs. out, on vs. off. Thousands of binary oppositions that are the way the human mind makes sense of and structures the meaning of this reality that we\u2019re in. Remember when we talked about the structure of language\u2026and how Sassure thought that words only have meaning in terms of their relationship to the other words within a given language? The example was that the word cow only has meaning insofar as it is not the word cat, or dog or horse. Well a similar sort of pattern starts to emerge for Claude Levi-Strauss when he looks at the structure of culture. When we look at one of these binary oppositions in particular, say up vs down\u2026the only way the concept of up, has any meaning to us, is in the relationship between up and it\u2019s binary opposite, down. That is where the meaning lies\u2026it\u2019s in the relationship between the terms in these binary oppositions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow as you can imagine, not every binary opposition is as basic as up vs. down. Because as humans continue to create a given culture\u2026and they set up more and more of these binary parameters that allow for societies to function well together, as we do that these binary oppositions start to get a little more abstract as they are used to make sense of more abstract things. For example, clean vs. dirty\u2026like the mythology embedded into the way we look at soap. Just vs unjust\u2026like the way we look at our society that things like professional wrestling and its mythology affect. Now these examples start to seem a little more complicated than something like up vs. down. There\u2019s a sense in which there\u2019s probably more conversation that needs to be had about whether things are clean vs dirty than by just looking at it strictly in binary terms. For example, when you just get done cleaning your kitchen table, and the first microscopic skin cell flakes off of your arm and hits the table\u2026or the first speck of dust gets on it\u2026is the table no longer clean? Where exactly do we make that distinction? What it seems like is that thinking about things in strictly a binary way ignores the existence of an entire spectrum of nuance that lies within those two binary poles. Yet, it is undeniably useful to us.. when navigating our lives and structuring our culture.. to think of things like our kitchen table, or the sidewalks of our city streets, or the operating room of a hospital in binary terms like clean vs dirty.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is why these structures that underly culture are often spoken about as narrow, distorted or merely humanistic. Because, while it\u2019s impossible to do entirely, try to remove yourself from this human scaffolding we\u2019ve set up on planet earth for a sec and try to apply some of these binary oppositions to the universe as a whole. Leave planet earth, go 10 million galaxies in one direction, look around you\u2026which way is up and which way is down? Well who am I to say what up and down is in relation to the entire universe? I can\u2019t just point up\u2026what if I\u2019m flipped around? Is there even such a thing as up or down on the level of the universe? Well how about clean and dirty\u2026would you consider that galaxy in the distance a clean place or a dirty place? In other words, what it can start to seem like is that\u00a0the terms clean and dirty are narrow parameters that we\u2019ve created as a culture, that undeniably help us navigate our lives and allow society to function well, but there\u2019s a sense in which the terms clean and dirty, and many of these binary oppositions for that matter\u2026don\u2019t even exist\u2026outside of this narrow human scaffolding that we\u2019ve set up that allows us to make sense of things.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow when these binary oppositions start to get really tricky to maintain is when we use them to make meaningful structures that potentially have huge negative effects on people\u2019s lives. For example, sane vs insane. Who or what exactly determines at what point somebody becomes insane? You can think of this like the dust on the kitchen table, at what point does it become dirty? Well at what point do we confer all of the negative effects onto someone that come along with being someone who is insane within a society? Free vs caged? Well, anyone who\u2019s listened to the episodes of this show on existentialism knows that it\u2019s no where near as simple as thinking about freedom in strictly binary terms like that. Freedom is always freedom within a cage, it just comes down to how big your cage is and whether you\u2019re satisfied by it. You can imagine if someone used mythology to get people within a culture to ignore the nuances and think of their freedom strictly in binary terms, you could get them to live in a pretty small cage without them even realizing it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nClaude Levi-Strauss moves to Brazil and teaches at the university of Sao Paulo from 1934 \u2013 1939. While he\u2019s there, he becomes fascinated with premodern cultures and travels deep into Brazil to make contact with remote tribes that are completely disconnected from the modern world. What he finds\u2026 is that when you apply structural anthropology towards studying the culture of these remote tribes, cultures that most people of his time would look at and see as \u201cprimitive\u201d or less advanced than the culture of modern France where he comes from, what he finds is that there is actually very little difference between the way those two cultures are structured. He\u00a0gives the example of a pack of cards, all separated by suit, A-K, four columns. When you look at the cultures side by side they can appear to be massively different from each other, a spade doesn\u2019t look anything like a heart. But when you pay attention to the structures of the culture, you can see the fingerprints left behind by the way the human mind interfaces with reality no matter what part of the world you\u2019re from, you can see the ace of hearts align with the ace of clubs. You can see the seven of spades align with the seven of diamonds. What Levi-Strauss finds in these remote, uncontacted tribes\u2026 is the very same method of using binary oppositions to structure the meaning of the things in their culture\u2026and that no matter how superior the modern, advanced cultures would like to think that they are, cultures that think of themselves in terms of advanced vs primitive, modern vs. ancient good vs. bad, what it starts to look like is that cultures are not good or bad in the way we\u2019d traditionally described them, they only differ when it comes to the specific rituals they engage in\u00a0that they\u2019ve connected to this underlying structure of culture\u2026.and here\u2019s the thing that\u2019ll really get you thinking: these rituals are arbitrary. One culture may shake your hand as a respectful greeting another may bow, but these two rituals serve the same function in both cultures. Think about that: these rituals interact with culture in what seems to be the exact same way signs interact with the structure of language. We\u2019re doing the same thing in both places.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis discovery would have massive effects on the way people starting thinking about the way we structure modern, advanced cultures. Next episode, we\u2019re gonna start talking about it. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_91": {"date": "2018-8-15", "text": "Posted on August 15, 2018\nEpisode 121 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #121 on Michel Foucault. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo real quick just to clarify something: towards the end of last episode I talked about doing a couple episodes on the late work of Wittengenstein and Heidegger\u2026uh, but based on the emails I received after releasing last episode, it seems clear that people don\u2019t really want to hear about it, they just want to move on to Postmodernism. Now, personally, I think to fully understand Postmodernism it\u2019s absolutely crucial to understand this transition from Logical Positivism to the mid 20th century where there is more of a focus on Behaviourism and Pragmatism, but look let\u2019s be honest here, at the end of the day I\u2019m a dancing monkey making episodes about what the majority of people want to hear or else I go out of business\u2026so with that in mind, today\u2019s episode is part one of a series on Michel Foucault\u2026and if you\u2019re at all confused about any of the context of these ideas that are being brought up, send me an email, I\u2019ll respond to as many of them as I can.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut that said, if someone were going to write a shortlist of the quintessential, Postmodernist philosophers\u2026of what is meant when someone says Postmodernist philosopher: Foucault is definitely going to be on that list. But to some\u2026relegating the work of Foucault and labeling it as merely being in the realm of philosophy\u2026doesn\u2019t really do him justice\u2026because his work often times moves into areas that have nothing to DO with philosophy\u2026to some you could easily refer to Foucault as a historian, or a political theorist, or a social commentator\u2026depending on what era of his life he wrote the book you\u2019re reading, you could have very different impressions about what subject matters were important to him. This makes it completely impossible for us to cover the entire scope of Foucault\u2019s work in a single episode, and it can make it kind of hard to find a clean entry point into covering his work\u2026 but I think a really good place to start is for us to talk about the details of his 1975 book titled Discipline and Punish.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, to a total outsider to the work of Michel Foucault\u2026 to someone who just picked up and read Discipline and Punish one day\u2026the book may seem to be just a history of criminology\u2026a historical catalogue of the ways we\u2019ve treated and punished criminals over the centuries. But as we\u2019ll talk about later on today\u2019s episode, Foucault is actually making a much deeper point with this book\u2026he\u2019s making a point about the structures of where power lies and the relationship between the people in power and the average citizen\u2026and just so the first half of the podcast doesn\u2019t COMPLETELY come off as me doing a documentary about the history of how we\u2019ve treated prisoners\u2026I want to ask some questions throughout the episode the sort of foreshadow to why this may be much bigger than just Foucault going over the history of this stuff.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the way, Foucault himself would never describe this book as a \u201chistory\u201d of anything. Foucault hated the word history and almost never used it in his writing. He used words to describe this book more like, a geneology of the way we\u2019ve treated criminals, or an archaeology of how criminals have been punished over the years. He hates the word history\u2026because so often the word history brings with it a connotation\u2026 that we exist in our modern world at the end of this long historical timeline of events that have led to near constant progress. This idea that, hey, we used to be these barbaric savages that followed the playbook of Machievelli, the ends justify the means, we used to believe that it was morally acceptable for the king or the people in power to brutally torture and kill someone that was guilty of a heinous crime\u2026but then HISTORY happened. Time went on\u2026progress was made. Great political theorists came along\u2026great leaders, great ethical philosophers did their work and we all realized the error of our ways and brought into existence a more modern world where everyone is much more free\u2026the people in power inhibiting the lives of the average citizen far less than they used to . Foucault is going to call this assumption about history into question and really dig deeper into the idea of: how much has really changed when it comes to the fundamental relationship between those in power and the citizens?\n\n\u00a0\n\nFoucault begins exploring this idea in chapter one of Discipline and Punish by laying the groundwork for the discussion, and describing what it was like to be a criminal in Western Europe in the 1750\u2019s. Specifically he gives an example of what the world was like at this time\u2026 by describing an actual punishment that was carried out on a criminal in the year 1757. Listen to the punishment this person faced for the crimes they had committed\u2026this punishment was to be implemented in public, on the steps of the church and the criminal was to be:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201ctaken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing but a shirt, holding a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds\u201d; then, on a scaffold that will be erected there, the flesh will be torn from his breasts, arms, thighs and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be torn away, poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax and sulphur melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes and his ashes thrown to the winds\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat was an actual punishment carried out on an actual person in the year 1757. Now, a few things Foucault would want us to initially consider about this situation: one would be to recognize the fact\u2026 that this sentence was handed down on what may as well be a distant alien planet to the planet that you live on. See, because it\u2019s so easy to hear about a punishment like this\u2026weigh it up against the moral intuitions that happened to be given to you in modern times\u2026feel morally superior to the people that lived in the 1750\u2019s and then write off their entire culture as just barbaric savagery from a bygone era that to even talk about is legitimizing a waste of time. What could we possibly learn from people that thought something like this was a good idea? But the problem with this approach to Foucault is that if you always end the conversation here, number 1. you never understand the\u00a0historical context that explains why things were different back then\u2026but number two, and more importantly to Foucault, that feeling of moral superiority often times gets us to never consider the similarities between the world back then and the world as it is now, more specifically the power structures of that time, their relationship to the citizens and how many aspects of them still persist to this day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause think about it: this punishment was handed down in a world that was pre-American revolution, pre-French revolution. The nation-state that sentenced this prisoner to this punishment was not modeled after the Enlightenment, it was modeled more after a Rennaisance era interpretation of Machievelli\u2019s The Prince and Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. The stability of this particular society would have been grounded in social contract theory\u2026or if you remember from the podcast episodes we did about this period, the idea that upon birth, every citizen of the nation-state effectively signs a social contract\u2026the citizens sacrifice a certain amount to the state by way of taxation or public service or by other means, and in return they receive protection\u2026protection from what Hobbes calls the State of Nature, protection by a King or a Magistrate or whatever sovereign body is in charge that guarantees certain natural rights for people. Put another way: the citizen\u2019s job is to sacrifice for the sovereign, so that the sovereign can do their job of guaranteeing the natural rights of the population, INCLUDING punishing criminals that disobey the law. This is a contract where BOTH parties have very important roles if society is going to function.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow another thing you may remember from the episodes we did on Hobbes\u2026is that when somebody commits a crime in one of these societies, the act is seen as a direct attack on the body politic. Not only that, but the crime is seen as a direct affront to every single citizen that has signed a social contract, each one of them making up a small piece of that Leviathan that Hobbes describes\u2026but more importantly than either of those two things, when a crime is committed in one of these societies it is seen as a direct affront\u2026 to the authority, of the king\u2026and it\u2019s RIGHT here, Foucault thinks, that you can start to see the true, primary function of the penal system in one of these societies in the 1750\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe goal of the criminal justice system back then was not justice\u2026there was no real focus on a balancing of the scales in any sort of way. The goal of implementing the punishment wasn\u2019t fairness\u2026people didn\u2019t get the same punishment for the same crime generally speaking. The true function of the criminal justice system, the REASON these punishments were often dramatic and ALWAYS carried out in front of everyone in public as a spectacle, the primary function was its ability to maintain social order, and it achieved this goal in a couple of key ways: first of all\u2026 this type of system was a fantastic deterrent of criminal behavior\u2026because if you were someone who had plans that day of committing some sort of heinous criminal act\u2026look no further than the guy getting his arms ripped off by red hot pincers as a persuasive essay as to why you shouldn\u2019t be doing that stuff. But the other reason this type of system was so good\u2026 beCAUSE in one of these societies, when a crime is committed it directly calls into question the authority of the sovereign\u2026these punishments being carried out in front of everybody on the church steps\u2026ended up being an extremely useful public spectacle\u2026because these punishments served as reinforcement of the fact\u2026direct evidence OF the fact\u2026that the sovereign was still upholding their end of the social contract.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe primary goal of this entire display was not justice, it was not fairness\u2026it was the maintaining of order within the society\u2026 and Foucault would want to point out that if you\u2019re the sovereign\u2026 if you\u2019re the person or group that\u2019s been commissioned by one of these societies to maintain order\u2026 an absolutely crucial part of doing your job is to make sure that you\u2019re still in power, able to maintain order tomorrow, or next week, or a month from now. In other words, Foucault is saying: an intrinsic, necessary part of that task of maintaining order, if you\u2019re the sovereign, is preserving the existing power structure. But to ask a foreshadowing question here: what happens when the power structure no longer serves the needs of the people?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Foucault would want to point out that not only did having a sovereign whose job it was to maintain order in this way\u2026 work for us\u2026but it worked well. In fact, it worked EXTREMELY well for hundreds of years\u2026but\u2026 eventually, as is the case with ANY imperfect system, the sovereign and other people in positions of power started to notice some patterns with societies that were structured this way and how they rise and fall\u2026they started to run into some unintended consequences\u2026 flaws in the system that seemed to be repeating themselves over and over again. See, because when you\u2019re in the business of publicly executing people for the sake of sending a message about where the power lies in a society\u2026things don\u2019t always play out seamlessly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, sometimes\u2026 when you try to publicly execute someone\u2026they don\u2019t die. SOMETHING\u2019s eventually gonna go wrong\u2026the equipment malfunctions\u2026the horses aren\u2019t cooperating that day\u2026you try to hang someone but they have like a six pack on their neck and they just kinda hang there for a few hours laughing at you. Point is: these sorts of things happened sometimes\u2026and when they did it wasn\u2019t a far leap for the population to start considering whether this was some sort of bad omen\u2026was this a sign that the authority of the sovereign was wavering\u2026that they were no longer capable of carrying out their end of the social contract?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only unintended consequence that started to crop up in these societies. For example, at the beginning of the episode we talked about a pretty extreme punishment in 1757 that Foucault cites in chapter one of Discipline and Punish. Well it wasn\u2019t entirely uncommon when one of THESE sorts of punishments were carried out on someone\u2026 that the population might think that the punishment greatly exceeded the severity of the crime that was committed. When this sort of thing happened, it wasn\u2019t entirely uncommon for the population to side with the criminal\u2026or at the very least call into question the authority of the sovereign and whether they\u2019re still running things properly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut probably the biggest unintended negative consequence for the sovereign that NOBODY saw coming\u2026was that when you have these brutal executions and punishments taking place in the public square every day in front of every one\u2026when society\u2019s functioning well and the sovereign is doing their job\u2026there is zero doubt in ANYONE\u2019S mind when it comes to who is in charge. There is zero question as to who you\u2019ll have to answer to and how you\u2019ll have to answer to them should you decide to go against the rules enforced by the existing power structure. But the flip side to that\u2026is that when things are NOT going well\u2026say there\u2019s a famine\u2026or Natural Rights aren\u2019t being guaranteed, or even if there\u2019s just a public sentiment that the sovereign is inept and some change needs to take place\u2026the flip side is that there is zero confusion in anyone\u2019s mind when looking for the people in power that need to be overthrown and killed for this change to occur.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat the sovereign and the people in power started to realize\u2026 is that in this type of society that we\u2019re talking about, brutal as it was, the will of the people often had influence over which people were in positions of power\u2026and this could be EXTREMELY inconvenient for the sovereign at times\u2026it made staying in a position of power for any extended period of time a pretty vulnerable enterprise. The people in positions of power knew that something drastic had to change if they wanted to make power more sustainable\u2026and Foucault documents a fundamental shift that occurs in the way societies treat criminals that takes place between the years 1757 and 1837.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, real quick, I\u2019m just anticipating a place that someone\u2019s brain might go here: oh, so what you\u2019re saying is that a bunch of evil people in positions of power realized that in this older type of society the will of the people ACTUALLY had some influence could throw them OUT of positions of power\u2026so they all got together, met in back rooms, formed a secret society, called it something like the council of the drifting phoenix where they had some creepy secret handshake and they all sat around coming up with ways to control the population so they\u2019d never have to relinquish power. But what Foucault would probably want to point out is that there doesn\u2019t need to be some evil secret society for people in government to want power to be more deeply embedded. Remember, the people in positions of power signed a social contract as well. Part of that social contract is maintaining the order of society so that they can continue to guarantee the natural rights of the citizens, and part of maintaining order historically, to Foucault, has been to preserve the existing power structure. There doesn\u2019t need to be a single, evil person in any of these positions of power for them to be motivated to come up with new, better tactics to stay in power\u2026.and Foucault would say these new tactics that are being implemented between the years 1757 and 1837\u2026is a broader evolution of the way people in power keep prisoners under control.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese changes occur gradually\u2026over the course of decades\u2026sometimes just with subtle changes to the ceremony of the public execution itself. Whereas before prisoners used to just be paraded around in an open top cart before their execution\u2026slowly over the years that evolved into a closed top cart with wooden planks that you could hardly see the person through\u2026that eventually evolved into a bag being over the person\u2019s head and their identity completely concealed. By the 1790\u2019s, most societies had moved away from these dramatic or creative public executions and favored the more standardized punishment of a guillotine in front of the courthouse\u2026few years later the guillotine was moved behind the courthouse\u2026until eventually it was moved inside the prison and all the executions were done in private. Punishment\u2026and the reality of the way we treat criminals\u2026has slowly moved from before when it was something that was at the forefront of public consciousness that it was impossible not to be aware of\u2026to now, when it is something abstract, silent, cordoned off and even locked away in these distant far away buildings that we never have to see. To ask a couple more foreshadowing questions: what sort of effects might that have on a society\u2026and more importantly why might people who want to maintain their positions of power prefer a situation like this?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the year 1837, two fundamental changes had occurred in the way we punish criminals that Foucault says are extremely deliberate. Number one: putting somebody to death as a public spectacle that everybody gets to witness had all but disappeared. And number two: we had changed tactics from punishing criminals by inflicting harm on their bodies\u2026to the emergence of a new era in our methods of punishing criminals where now we focused primarily on the disciplining and control of their minds. There is a fundamental shift from physical punishment of the person\u2019s body\u2026to the disciplining and reformation of the person\u2019s mind. This is why Foucault titles the book Discipline and Punish\u2026this is the emergence and infancy of what will eventually become the modern prison\u2026this is the beginning of an evolution where people in positions of power develop a much more efficient and effective way of wielding and sustaining power over people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFoucault cites an actual strict schedule that criminals in the 1830\u2019s serving time had to follow during their time in prison. You can imagine what something like this might look like: 7am wake up. 7:05 you are to be on your mark for roll call. 7:15 you are to be at the mess hall for breakfast. 7:25 you are to be at your assigned job post for the day. 9:15 water break, 9:20 back to work\u2026in other words: when your ENTIRE day is scheduled and accounted for down to the second\u2026there\u2019s not much time for illicit criminal activity. There\u2019s not much time for ANY thought outside of disciplining yourself and adhering to this schedule of stuff you\u2019re required to do. Well couple this new, strict focus on the disciplining of the mind and reformation of behavior with MORE new tactics that were emerging over the years\u2026more specifically a new, improved, three pronged approach towards controlling prisoners that Foucault thinks is one of the most effective methods that has ever been devised.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe three\u2026prongs\u2026of this three pronged method that is used to keep prisoners in line\u2026are what Foucault calls: Surveillence, Normalization, and Examination. That is\u2026Constant surveillance of the prisoners\u2026which combines nicely with normalization\u2026or a normalized standard of how a good prisoner should be thinking and behaving that has been given to you by the people in power\u2026and both of these work nicely with a constant process of examination and re-examination where people in positions of power give you a score or a grade determining how well you\u2019re corresponding with that way of behaving that we\u2019ve decided a good prisoner should be a reflection of.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFoucault thinks this new, highly effective way of controlling prisoners may have sprung out of the work of a philosopher named Jeremy Bentham. The same way Plato in The Republic spends a considerable amount of time trying to come up with the ideal structure of government\u2026Jeremy Bentham spends a bunch of time in HIS work trying to come up with the ideal structure of a prison. The model that he arrives at after thinking about it for so long is what he calls The Panopticon. Simply put, the Panopticon is a building designed and laid out in a clever way, where a single guard, or a warden or anyone in a position of power can stand in a specific spot in the center\u2026and THEY can see inside of the cell of any prisoner they want\u2026 but the prisoners can\u2019t see them, they can\u2019t know WHEN they\u2019re being watched, they can\u2019t know the criteria that determines WHY they\u2019re being watched\u2026in a sense, Bentham says, the reason this is an ideal design for a prison\u2026is because the only reasonable thing the prisoners can do in a prison that\u2019s designed this way\u2026is to behave every second of every day as though they\u2019re being watched\u2026because they can never know when or when its not happening. Their lives become, once again, constant surveillance through cameras or armed guards, strict adherence to a normalized \u201cway a good prisoner behaves\u201d given to them by the people in power, and rigorous examination by experts, or the court system or the parole board or whoever it is THIS WEEK for the prisoner to answer to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow some of you out there might be thinking: why are we going on so much about the history of criminals? What does this have to do with philosophy? What relevance does this have to me whatsoever? Well, if you\u2019re someone that\u2019s thought that all we\u2019ve been talking about so far on this episode are methods we\u2019ve developed over the years for controlling\u2026 only prisoners\u2026Foucault would probably say I hope you\u2019ve been paying attention to the details of what\u2019s been said so far\u2026because when Jeremy Bentham sits down and creates the design of this Panopticon of his\u2026hes not just talking about the ideal structure of a prison\u2026and what follows from that is that Foucault is NOT JUST talking about the evolution of methods that we\u2019ve developed to control prisoners.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJeremy Bentham describes the Panopticon very generally in his work\u00a0as \u201ca new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example\u201d\u2026and knowing that\u2026it makes sense that he quickly goes on to say that although this is the ideal structure of a\u00a0prison if you wanted to control prisoners\u2026there\u2019s no reason why this same design couldn\u2019t be applied if you wanted to create, you know, a mental institution that promotes a standard to the inmates of what a good patient is\u2026or in a military setting promoting what it is to be a good soldier\u2026or in a university setting promoting how you should think and behave if you want to be a good student\u2026if Bentham lived in a modern economic society he no doubt would see the utility of the Panopticon if it was applied to a factory and producing good factory workers\u2026or even more generally how it could be used at a multi-national corporation trying to produce good employees.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee, that\u2019s the thing. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in a position of power in a corporation\u2026to be able to use the fundamentals of these highly effective tactics that have been developed over the years to control your employees, you don\u2019t need to treat them like they\u2019re a prisoner that\u2019s part of a chain gang forced to crush rocks all day\u2026no, as long as you make sure that their chain is long enough that they don\u2019t FEEL like a prisoner\u2026you can set up some pretty narrow parameters for what it is to be a \u201cgood employee\u201d that not only will they fall into\u2026but they will actually police themselves to stay that way\u2026they\u2019ll feel intense pressure to adhere to that normalized standard of behavior at all times, because their life at work is one of surveillance, normalization and examination. Surveillance by way of cameras, time clocks, supervisors, deadlines, monitoring activity on your computer, even sometimes just the surveillance of other employees around that feel like they benefit from having dirt on someone in a highly competitive environment. The normalized standard of being a good employee\u2026speaking, acting and dressing in a professional way, however that\u2019s defined by whoever in the company. Putting on your work persona\u2026always being politically correct\u2026doing all the things to make sure you\u2019re a good team player. Then it\u2019s on to the examination phase with your monthly, quarterly, yearly evaluations where they give you a score out of ten in different areas to determine how well your doing\u2026or in other words how well you correspond with exactly who I say you should be. Your productivity is about the same level as last evaluation\u2026you\u2019re doing good in some areas\u2026but there\u2019s room for improvement in a couple other areas and don\u2019t worry\u2026I made an action plan so that we can see if we can get you back on track. This three pronged method\u2026 has become the dominant way of controlling human behavior\u2026and if you doubt that in any way\u2026consider the similarities it has to the structure of some religions with the constant surveillance, normative behavior and rigorous process of examination. This method is so effective\u2026 and so capable of being applied to any circumstance imaginable\u2026that in our modern world it has so pervaded the way power is exercised that it extends beyond institutions like prisons or corporations and it has embedded itself into the very fabric of society. The very same process of surveillance, normalization and examination could be said to exist in the way you present yourself online\u2026the media you consume\u2026it most likely is even being played out in various social circles that you\u2019re a part of right now. Foucault would say one of the truly insidious things about the way power is wielded and people are controlled in modern times with these new methods, is that simultaneously you are both a subject that is being controlled while also being an active participant in the system\u2026an active participant that in some way, most times unknowingly, supports the existing power structure.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s slow down for a second and really talk about what is being implied here for Foucault. Remember the criminal justice system back in the 1750\u2019s? So as we talked about the goal of the whole situation back then was clearly not primarily justice or fairness\u2026but instead the benefits the system provided to society when it came to maintaining order and keeping things moving forward. Well Foucault is going to ask: is the penal system of the 1970\u2019s really so different when you take a closer look at it? Do we exist in a modern, enlightened era where we\u2019ve grown throughout history and learned the error of our ways and constructed a penal system that first and foremost has the aim of distributing justice and fairness? To Foucault, the goal of the modern penal system is not justice or fairness\u2026the goal is through surveillance, normalization and examination to produce harmless, non-rebellious, working, tax-paying productive citizens who follow the rules and are satisfied with a life of conforming to the normalized standard of what it is to be a person handed down to them from above\u2026in other words, docile, useful subjects that carry out the vision for what the future should hold given to them by the people in power.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is why there is such a difference when it comes to sentencing between white collar and blue collar crimes. Between an executive that robs the IRS of $20,000 by evading taxes\u2026and some dude that robs a Taco Bell of $85 bucks and a burrito supreme.\u00a0Short of the executive absolutely refusing to pay back the money\u20269 times out of 10 they are not going to see the inside of a prison cell because their behavior\u2026doesn\u2019t really need much reformation in the eyes of the people in power. Keep doing almost everything you\u2019re doing\u2026keep working, keep creating jobs, keep starting new companies and going to badminton on Sundays\u2026just pay your taxes. Whereas the guy that robbed the Taco Bell\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter if he marches back into the store\u2026hands over the 85 bucks directly to the manager\u2026baby birds the burrito supreme back into his mouth\u20269 times out of 10 that guy is going to jail because the goal of the penal system is reforming criminals to fit a pre-existing mold of what a normal person is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso consider the fact\u2026that once you\u2019re sentenced\u2026it isn\u2019t about justice or fairness or some sort of direct punishment and retribution for the crimes you committed at that point either\u2026in today\u2019s day and age there\u2019s the modern advent of getting out on good behavior. In other words, as long as you\u2019re willing to reform yourself into the type of person that we\u2019ve told you to be\u2026it doesn\u2019t really matter what your initial sentence was\u2026we may knock a couple decades off your sentence if you\u2019re willing to play by our rules.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow\u00a0some people\u2026no matter how many times they go to prison\u2026are just the type of people that are never going to play by the rules. They\u2019re never going to become this person the people in power want them to become\u2026they\u2019re never going to change\u2026 and those people are the people that will either be lifelong repeat offenders in and out of jail\u2026or they will eventually get life in prison.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Foucault would say that it\u2019s these kinds of people that refuse to play by the rules that are absolutely fascinating to us as \u201cnormal\u201d people. That\u2019s another modern invention for Foucault\u2026thinking of ourselves as normal and the labeling of criminals as \u201cabnormal\u201d or people that need to be reformed to a state of normalcy. But its the fact that they\u2019re not like normal people that makes us so fascinated by criminals! Look at the thousands of True Crime podcasts that have exploded onto the podcast scene in the past couple years. Massively popular. Look on Netflix at all the crime related shows there are. If you still have a TV subscription, look at all the shows on the air documenting some crime that was committed. This fascination is not a modern phenomena to Foucault\u2026this has existed all throughout our history. In the American West, there was Billy the Kid. In the Great Depression, Bonnie and Clyde. Criminals can even become folk heroes like DB Cooper, but this doesn\u2019t just happen in the United States\u2026this has happened all over the world. Part of the reason these older societies moved away from the direction of executing criminals as a public spectacle\u2026is because of the very real effects of what happens when you put a criminal beloved by the public at center stage. Foucault thinks we love criminals so much because when they vehemently refuse to play by the rules of society\u2026they have an ability to show us exactly what we are.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe law-abiding, occupants and active participants in what is effectively a massive social prison. We live our lives trapped in a cell inside of a Panopticon. Or a Panopticon inside of ANOTHER Panopticon. In fact, the Panopticon is a great metaphor for the entire project of modernity, to Foucault. See just like in the actual prison\u2026where the goal of the operation is not some higher virtue like justice, but instead to reform prisoners into subjects that are useful for keeping society going\u2026we, as occupants of our social prison, are constantly being disciplined and reformed into good employees, good consumers, good voters, good students, good friends..all internalized expectations of ourselves given to us by someone in a position of power. We\u2019re given standards by TV shows, movies, books, all media\u2026standards we internalize that tell us how our bodies should look, what beauty is, what you should care about, what you can say and can\u2019t say, what some people can do that you can\u2019t do, there is no prison or method of torture that has ever been devised that can do to people what they willingly do to themselves in our modern social prison.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe live in a Panopticon, because we live our lives as though we are constantly being watched and held to these standards about how we should be that are given to us by media. But the truly sick part about it is that we have constructed a world where we are simultaneously\u2026 the prisoner being reformed in the cell, AND the warden at the center of the Panopticon that\u2019s constantly watching us. We\u2019ve created a world where we are under constant surveillance by ourselves. Surveillence by looking in the mirror\u2026wondering if you should starve yourself tonight to lose that two pounds that will make you beautiful. Surveillance of your own irrational, toxic thoughts, but you suffer in silence rather than have to face the shame of asking for help and appearing weak "}, "episode_92": {"date": "2018-9-24", "text": "Posted on September 24, 2018\nEpisode 122 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #122 on Michel Foucault. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo once upon a time Michel Foucault found himself living in an age of almost unparallelled optimism about science. He was living in a world in the early to mid 20th century, not far removed from those huge leaps forward that we talked about in quantum mechanics, general relativity, many other things\u2026and there were a lot of thinkers around this time that were EXTREMELY enthusiastic about science being the way that we were finally going to figure things out for good. In fact, things looked so promising back then\u2026 there were even some scientists that were saying that it may be totally possible\u2026that every phenomena that we observe, every cause and effect across the ENTIRE landscape of science\u2026may be reduceable\u2026to physics. This attitude is also known as Physical Reductionism. Now, at first this can seem like kind of a weird claim for a scientist to make, but when you consider the size and scope of the breakthroughs that had happened during their lifetimes and when you look at science the way they did it makes total sense\u2026after all: for example, we often wonder about the psychology of an individual\u2026and what led them to think some thought or make some choice. Well, it\u2019s not crazy to think that someone\u2019s psychology and the decisions they make is massively influenced by their biology and the way that biology interfaces with the world around them. Psychology, in a way, depends on Biology. Well, it\u2019s not crazy to think that biology is massive influenced by a complex ecosystem of chemical reactions that are going on. Biology depends on Chemistry. It\u2019s not crazy to think that chemistry is nothing more than the interactions between atoms and molecules that ultimately adhere to the laws of physics. What some scientists were saying during this time is that while we obviously are no where near this point yet\u2026it\u2019s not CRAZY to say that at some point in the future we may have such a deep understanding of all of these fields\u2026 that complex things like thoughts and behaviors may be able to be predicted by science at the level of physics. There\u2019s a feeling at the time that things like physics, mathematics and cosmology are more pure in terms of being a science than something like psychology. Not that psychology is not important; the point is that these three fields are the simplest forms of science, they seem to be the most foundational forms of science and they require the least amount of conjecture or theory to justify the conclusions they arrive at, than any other science.\n\nThis is why, once upon a time, Foucault finds himself in a world where practically every person that came before him that sat down and wrote a history of science\u2026 looked at that history primarily in terms of the advancements in those three fields: physics, mathematics and cosmology. Well Foucault sees this\u2026and immediately realizes that this may be creating a huge blind spot when it comes to our understanding of the history of science\u2026what FOUCAULT wants to do, is take a look at that very same history, but instead look at it through the lens of three different fields, three neglected fields in the history of science: Biology, Linguistics and Economics.\n\nSee, because Foucault is much less concerned with the history of mathematics or physics or even the specifics of what particular scientists have said in the past. He\u2019s more concerned with the underlying rules that exist in the background of ALL scientific inquiry, that make conducting science even possible\u2026and the relationship between scientific knowledge and power structures in the world around us.\n\nLet me explain over the course of the next two episodes. The fancy way of putting it is that Foucault would say that in our world there is a dichotomy between discursive formations and non-discursive formations. A dichotomy between what others would later call the articulatable and the visible. The non-fancy way of putting this is that since the 1700\u2019s\u2026we\u2019ve had on one hand the institutions that make up our societies, hospitals, schools, prisons\u2026social circles of many varieties, also known as non-discursive formations\u2026but then on the other hand we\u2019ve always had the systems of langauge that we use to TALK about these institutions\u2026language that drastically changes the way we view the FUNCTION of those institutions, or discursive formations.\n\nFor example, in our modern world when we think of a school\u2026the primary function of a school is educating the youth. When we think of a hospital: primary function of a hospital is to provide care to the patients\u2026we think of a prison, primary function as we talked about last episode, is the reformation of the minds of the criminals.\n\nIn other words\u2026and this is a massive thru-line in Foucault\u2019s fifth book in 1966 titled The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Sciences\u2026in other words we live in a world where Foucault says there is a clear dichotomy between seeing and saying. A dichotomy between SEEING systems of representation, the visible, things like hospitals and schools, and then SAYING things ABOUT those systems, the articulatable, or the language we use that drastically effects the way we see them.\n\nIf there was a primary concern of this book, that Foucault would want to make sure was clear so that it sets up all the OTHER primary concerns of this book, this would be it. Discursive is just a fancy word for talking about discourse. Discourse is also just a fancy word, but it\u2019s complicated because it\u2019s a fancy word that Foucault uses in many different ways all throughout his work. The meaning of the word seems to evolve over time\u2026depending on where you\u2019re reading it could mean anything from just the language that surrounds a topic, to the assumptions in the way that people think and talk about a subject, all the way to a set of concepts that relate in some way to another set of concepts that allow us to make sense of things in a particular period of time. The reason this is so weird right here, is because Foucault almost always uses the word discourse with the word \u201cscientific\u201d preceding it\u2026and whenever he references scientific discourse\u2026 he\u2019s usually talking about a large and complex network of meaning and baggage that gets smuggled in whenever scientists claim to have knowledge about the way that things are. See, living in a world where so many people around him are worshiping at the altar of science, Foucault wants to shine a light on the limitations of science and show how the conclusions of science often times have unintended consequences that hurt people. Foucault and his views on science are a perfect example of a structuralist and post-structuralist butting heads with those outdated, Enlightenment era assumptions about science and philosophy that we\u2019ve talked about on previous episodes. The short version is that people may have become a little TOO enamored with science and logic BECAUSE of all the breakthroughs that occurred and BECAUSE they were trying to get away from the long tradition of philosophy being unverifiable speculation.\n\nSee, because another thing we missed by going over the Logical Positivists so quickly is that it wasn\u2019t just the Logical Positivists that were skeptical of the last couple hundred years of philosophy\u2026there were MANY thinkers around the early 20th century that thought of this entire period since the 17th century as what they would call The Metaphysical Age\u2026or the age when all kinds of thinkers decided to apply themselves to creating these massive, complicated, metaphysical systems that tried to explain everything\u2026a delusion that ran deep. With a lot of key players involved in the process\u2026we had Descartes whose system was critiqued by Spinoza and Hume, who then were eclipsed by the work of Kant, who then had to concede to the system of Hegel; the problem with looking at the history of philosophy this way is that it COMPLETELY ignores the fact, that it\u2019s a direct mirror of all the mistakes people were making when looking at ALL of history during this time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is: Foucault\u2019s problem with lumping everything in the last couple hundred years into something called The Metaphysical Age is a culmination of several problems we\u2019ve already talked about on this show when it comes to assumptions made in the thinking of the early 20th century. Remember? The outdated way of looking at history where we hyper-focus on subjectivity and the actions of a few key players? What is history? Oh, well history is when Napoleon invades Russia\u2026Harun Al Rashid captures THIS territory\u2026Bismarck signs THIS treaty\u2026but is this the totality of what history is? There are thousands of other angles you could view the history of the world from, and what happens when you do that? What new insights start to present themselves?\n\nRemember Thomas Kuhn, and his history of science\u2026and how he wants to move away from focusing on individuals like Copernicus and Newton and Einstein and THEIR subjectivity, THEIR individual achievements\u2026and instead wants to focus on larger, structural shifts that occur\u2026to instead look at history through the lens of large scale paradigm shifts as he calls them\u2026moments, when paradoxes and contradictions pile up and create fractures in the existing way of doing science\u2026fractures that eventually cause the whole scientific paradigm to break, at which point an entirely NEW method of doing science takes over. Doesn\u2019t viewing science from this slightly different angle give us fresh, new insights into the history of science that we would never see if we always looked at history through that lens that favors subjectivity so much? More than that though\u2026is THIS method the end all be all way of looking at the history of science? What possibile reason could anyone have to privilege Thomas Kuhn\u2019s method over any of the countless OTHER angles we could view the history of the world from? How much are we missing, by having such a rigid and narrow method of cataloging history?\n\nWell, Thomas Kuhn is just one example of many that are trying to find alternative histories\u2026Foucault\u2019s another thinker that\u2019s calling this stuff into question\u2026and you can see even before 1966 in The Order of Things that he\u2019s already looking for alternative ways of interpreting what has happened in the past.\n\nWe talked last time about two distinct, sort of, epochs that exist when it comes to the way we punish criminals, the sovereign age and the disciplinary age\u2026well there\u2019s similar sort of thing in Foucault\u2019s book titled Birth of the Clinic when it comes to the way we treat patients in hospitals. Once again, just so we\u2019re clear, Foucault is NOT viewing history in terms of the achievements of individuals, but instead in terms of vast periods or epochs that occur, for example when you READ Birth of the Clinic\u2026same sorta thing\u2026no individual doctors or technicians are featured prominently\u2026no, the feel of the book is more like: Well, in the 18th century, when people are sick, you have a building patients go to called a clinic\u2026in the 19th century you have a building patients go to called a hospital. In other words, the language has changed in some small way between these two periods\u2026another example: 18th century\u2026when a patient is sick\u2026they\u2019re seen as sort of immersed WITHIN a disease\u2026that\u2019s how people talked about illness in the 18th century\u2026the patient that\u2019s being treated is under the grip of the disease Cholera, for example\u2026whereas in the 19th century in a hospital the disease is seen as something inside the patient that needs to be fixed. Once again, the language used to describe the patient has changed\u2026another example: 18th century disease is talked about as a thing that is almost A priori\u2026disease exists as it\u2019s own thing, out there, independent of any human being contracting it\u2026in the 19th century the collection of symptoms within the person IS the disease itself.\n\nIn other words, in both centuries we\u2019re studying the same disease, you could have the same exact patient in both periods, but when the fundamental language we use to describe the illness changes, so too does the way that we see the illness and the patient and the task of the doctor and really some pretty important things about the way that we see the world!\n\nNow it might be tempting here to think that Foucault and Kuhn are essentially saying the same thing: instead of looking at individuals they\u2019re just looking at movements and trends\u2026but the nuances in the differences between them are actually crucial if we want to fully understand Foucault and his work.\n\nFoucault breaks down history into long periods or epochs that he calls epistemes\u2026and maybe the best place to start explaining this is to talk for a second about the differences between the paradigm shifts of Thomas Kuhn and these epistemes that Foucault is talking about.\n\nParadigms are easy\u2026all that Thomas Kuhn is referencing when he says paradigm are the dominant theories, practices, instruments, methodologies of a given period of time within the sciences. The scientist using these things not only knows all about them, they know that they are the best practices of the time they\u2019re living and if they\u2019re going to be conducting any sort of respectable science, they better be using them. Paradigms, generally speaking, dont last very long. They last for a while, but it\u2019s not long before better or different science comes along and replaces them. Paradigms\u2026can quite possibly only effect one discipline, for example, there could be a dominant paradigm specific to Biology that doesn\u2019t carry over into other fields of science.\n\nNow, epistemes on the other hand are NOT so easy. Here\u2019s the definition of what Foucault means by an episteme:\n\n\u201cthe historical, but non-temporal,\u00a0a priori which grounds knowledge and its\u00a0discourses and thus represents the\u00a0condition of their possibility within a particular epoch.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s unpack that and explain it using a bit more english. Similar to a paradigm, an episteme is a period of time. But UNLIKE a paradigm, where scientists are consciously aware of all the best scientific practices of the world they\u2019re living in, an episteme is set of entirely unconscious assumptions that are made.\n\nFoucault is making the case that every scientist, regardless of when they\u2019re conducting their work, does that work proceeding from certain background epistemological assumptions that make conducting science even possible, and these assumptions\u2026not only do scientists not realize that they\u2019re making them, but they are so deeply ingrained within the culture that the scientist lives in\u2026 that they ultimately dictate everything from the experiments the scientists chooses to run, to the questions the scientist thinks are worth answering, all the way down to what the scientific community as a whole decides should be accepted or rejected as fact.\n\nThe best way I\u2019ve ever seen it put is to think about it this way: you woke up this morning and chose the outfit that you were going to wear. Now, short of you being an exhibitionist or one of the chieftain nobles of a nudist colony, chances are there wasn\u2019t a single second in your mind when you entertained the possibility of going to work completely naked today. In fact\u2026let\u2019s say you\u2019re a complete weirdo\u2026in the event your mind actually went to a place like that even for a second, what would happen?\u2026well, you\u2019d immediately dismiss it as an idea\u2026and why? Because there is a cultural norm against nudity in public that runs so deep that to even entertain the possibility of going to work naked would not only be preposterous, but it would be a complete waste of your time to consider it as an option. Well, what if this same dynamic extended to the way you think and talk about everything? What if you were a scientist?\n\nThe point that Foucault\u2019s making here is that all of discourse, the entirety of the way you think and talk about things has been filtered through a set of background assumptions given to you by the cultural and historical conditions you were born into\u2026and these assumptions in the background are things that most people take to be just the common sense way that the world should be chopped up, if they\u2019re even aware of these things at all.\n\nBut this set of background assumptions change over time\u2026much less frequently than Thomas Kuhn\u2019s paradigms, not only that though! WHEN one of these epistemes changes it has a much more transformative effect on the world than when a scientific paradigms changes. A paradigm can change and it may only effect one or two fields\u2026when an episteme changes, it effects ALL of the sciences simultaneously. To return back to our definition\u2026these epistemes are the historical A priori (prior to experience in the world) that GROUNDS KNOWLEDGE\u2026and thus represents the condition of their possibility within a particular epoch or period of time\u2026let\u2019s talk about a couple examples of these epistemes.\n\nFoucault would say that if you could go back in time to the 17th century and talk to Hobbes or Francis Bacon or many others that are doing work\u2026and you could read their work from the perspective of someone living at the time, what you would notice is that they are always trying to make sense of things in terms of resemblances. The episteme of THEIR time, the background epistemological assumptions that they brought to bear unconsciously whenever they tried to make sense of things, was that they were always looking for similarities\u2026how one plant or animal species resembled another\u2026how one disease had similar properties to another disease\u2026how some idea from earlier theology was the same as some idea within philosophy. Resemblances and similarities between things defined the entire epoch of the Reannaisance to Foucault.\n\nAnother example: if you could go back in time give or take to the 18th century, you would see the rise of philosophy that sees the world in terms of differences rather than similarities, you\u2019d see abstractions about things like \u201chuman nature\u201d, you\u2019d see other ways of categorizing people, you\u2019d see the period that gives rise to the taxonomy of many different fields, not just people, plants and animals. Again, these tendencies are a byproduct of the unconscious, background epistemological assumptions, the episteme that the thinkers of this time were born into. If you were in the 19th or early 20th century, the modern episteme may dictate that you\u2019re done with things like taxonomies and are more in the business of categorizing what it means to be a human being. The question Foucault would want us to ask ourselves is: do you think even for a second that the 21st century DOESN\u2019T have an episteme that we are all unconsciously participating in?\n\nWhat Foucault\u2019s getting at is that he wants to get away from this nonsense of lumping all of these periods together and referring to them collectively as The Metaphysical Age, and he wants to start breaking them up and calling them what they are: different periods, distinct from each other, each with its own unique systems of acquiring knowledge, it\u2019s own systems of visibility and articulatability, it\u2019s own discursive and non-discursive formations and here\u2019s the kicker! All of these systems, and all of this discourse\u2026ultimately put in place and maintained by people in positions of power\u2026now, couple places your brain may go when I say that\u2026\n\nYou may picture a king wielding a scepter enforcing this stuff by decree\u2026you may picture a bunch of dudes in powdered wigs banging a gavel\u2026for our post-modern episteme you may picture police in riot gear with their foot on the back of someone\u2019s neck. In reality, systems of acquiring knowledge are rarely, if ever, enforced by this kind of power, and its right here\u2026that Foucault would want to draw a distinction between two different types of power that we come face to face with in our societies: a distinction between what he calls repressive power and normalizing power.\n\nRepressive power is the type of power I was just referencing\u2026boots on the back of the neck, military invasion\u2026essentially someone forcing you to do something you don\u2019t want to do. But there\u2019s a sense in which this type of power is inefficient and really only necessary if someone is actively defying you, which can raise the question: are you really in power if someone has the ability to cross you like that. No, TRUE power would be if you could somehow get people to believe that it was their idea to behave the way you want them to behave. True power would be if you could get people to think it was part of their personality, the very DEFINITION of what it is to be themselves is in accordance with the way you say they should be. THAT is the task that\u2019s accomplished by the normalizing power of society.\n\nThink about it. You woke up this morning and there was probably no part of you that thought what you want to do with your day today is you want to go down to a sketchy part of town and you want to score some black tar heroin from the guy on the street corner\u2026and why is that? Is it because you are scared of being arrested? Are you scared of Hank and the DEA kicking down your door? Or is it because going to sketchy parts of town and doing hardcore drugs like that is just not who you are?\n\nIn other words, not only are people WILLING to not do drugs, not steal, not punch their neighbor in the face and countless other things, but they\u2019re actually EXCITED about filling their role as a \u201cnormal person\u201d within society.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of normalization.\n\nSo if you consider all the stuff we\u2019ve talked about on the episode so far you can start to see the problems that you run into as a scientist from the perspective of Foucault. Because if you\u2019re someone born into an episteme, you already have a set of unconscious background assumptions that you\u2019re making that shade every thought you have\u2026you already have a narrow set of tools, instruments and methods that make up the scientific paradigm of your day, you already, by the time you\u2019re a working scientist, have gone through the school and university system and have had 20+ years of influence from a society trying to normalize your thought.\n\nNot only that though, the very field of science itself to Foucault, is an incredibly important part of the social structures that surround us\u2026all of which have a normalizing influence on thought. We need doctors to determine who is sick and who is well. We need psychologists to determine who is sane and who is crazy. We need thought leaders within the sciences to determine who is credible and who isn\u2019t. Science itself becomes a crucial part of the process of normalization\u2026because it becomes the standard that everything is measured up against to make sure things fit.\n\nBut what is this scientific standard that we\u2019re weighing everything up against other than a consensus, arrived at by a bunch of people born into an episteme, working through a scientific paradigm with 20+ years of normalizing influence on their thought? Foucault would say, the social structures that make so many aspects of our world even possible\u2026 are fueled by a narrow cultural discourse\u2026a cultural discourse that is constantly changing\u2026a cultural discourse that offers commentary on any topic you can possibly imagine, including, what it even is to be a human being.\n\nYou know, if it\u2019s not completely obvious by this point, Foucault is first and foremost in the business of questioning dominant narratives about things that most people just take to be \u201cthe way that things are.\u201d It\u2019s been said, and this is where we will begin the next episode of the show\u2026it\u2019s been said that Immanuel Kant\u2026considered by some to be the greatest philosopher to ever live\u2026one of the primary ideas that he explores in his work is the idea that through analysis of the subjective we may be able to arrive at objectivity. Through analyzing the lens that we experience the world through, our senses, our mental faculties, our ability to reason, if we study these things closely enough\u2026 we may be able to arrive at properties that are necessarily true about them or the world of phenomena that we\u2019re accessing. In other words, Kant is interested in taking the subjective, and arriving at things that are necessarily true about the world. Well, Foucault, again if it isn\u2019t entirely obvious by this point, is turning that whole thing on its head. Foucault is interested in finding things that we THINK are necessarily true, and showing them to be subjective and grounded in history. We\u2019ll pick up here next time. Thank you for listening. Talk to you then.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_93": {"date": "2018-9-24", "text": "Posted on September 24, 2018\nEpisode 123 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #123 on Michel Foucault. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo we ended last time by comparing the projects of Michel Foucault and Immanuel Kant\u2026Foucault essentially taking one of the main focus points of Kant\u2019s work and turning it on its head\u2026as we talked about: while Kant wanted to take the subjective and contingent of the world, analyze it\u2026study it\u2026and hopefully arrive at necessary truths about the way that things are, Foucault on the other hand wanted to take things that most people assumed were necessary truths and show how ultimately they were subjective, contingent and rooted in history\u2026to show how what we think of as the \u201ctruth\u201d\u2026is often nothing more than just the dominant narrative of the time we\u2019re living, now\u2026\n\nLast episode we talked about epistemes and paradigms\u2026Foucault questioning the dominant narrative of Scientism, of science being this disinterested vehicle for arriving at the \u201ctruth\u201d about things or \u201cfacts\u201d about the way that things are. Two episodes ago we talked about the book Discipline and Punish, Foucault questioning the dominant narrative that we used to be these barbaric savages that tortured our prisoners, but now we\u2019ve evolved ethically to the point that we have seen the error of our ways and now we treat them in a way that is much more humane.\n\nWell, it\u2019ll probably come as no surprise when I tell you\u2026these aren\u2019t the only two narratives that Foucault questioned in his lifetime. In fact, pretty much every major work Foucault produced is taking aim at some widely accepted narrative about the way that things are\u2026narratives that he thinks, when looked at from a different angle, show themselves to be narrow, arbitrary and potentially damaging to the people caught in the mix that the narrative is referencing\u2026for example:\u00a0\n\nTake Foucault\u2019s 1961 work Madness and Civilization. Discipline and Punish is to the way we\u2019ve treated criminals over the centuries, as Madness and Civilization is to the way we\u2019ve treated people over the centuries that society deems to be mad.\u00a0\n\nSee, Foucault realizes that it\u2019s easy to be born into the world in the 20th century and take for granted\u2026that if someone is mentally ill, what you should do is lock them up, have a bunch of experts study them, come up with a treatment plan for them\u2026and then medicate them and give them intensive therapy until they start to act like a \u201cnormal person\u201d.\u00a0\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t always been the way society treats the mentally ill, in fact, the idea of rounding these people up and locking them away in an asylum is actually a very recent thing\u2026for example\u2026in former societies\u2026in Ancient Greece for example, it wasn\u2019t an uncommon attitude at the time to see the people considered to be mad as \u201ctouched by the Gods\u201d\u2026they lived pretty normal lives, among the rest of the population and were accepted as just\u2026different, with a sort of outside of the box way of looking at things as long as they weren\u2019t hurting anybody\u2026there are many Greek plays where the protagonist is informed by somebody that everybody else in the play would see as crazy. In other societies the mad were seen as an important cog in the whole machine of society because through the crazy stuff they said they helped everyone around them identify the limits of reason.\u00a0\n\nFoucault would recognize, once again, the assumption that\u2019s easy to make being born into the 20th century is that for thousands of years these people were unmedicated, untreated, living their lives in abject suffering, and that nowadays, now that we have them in custody, now that they\u2019re in front of a panel of experts and on the right pill that makes them act normal, that their lives are better.\u00a0\n\nBut Foucault wouldn\u2019t let you off the hook there\u2026he would probably ask: what specifically is responsible for this sudden change in our attitudes towards how we treat the mentally ill in our societies? Foucault would no doubt think it is in large part due to science\u2026 and the discourse science produces surrounding the concept of mental illness.\u00a0\n\nBecause it\u2019s just been in the recent past that for the first time in human history, madness has become the object of scientific inquiry\u2026and over the years as science has progressively diagnosed, categorized, and medicated people that society deems to be mentally ill, the more they\u2019ve dehumanized these people and turned them into objects that exist for the sake of science being able to study them\u2026objects of study, rather than human beings. The more that science worked to understand these objects and turn them into something that looks like a normal person, the more torture they put these people through. There was a great quote on a Foucault documentary I watched a couple years ago, it went:\n\n\u201cThe more people cared, the less people cured. The more they intervened, the more they oppressed.\u201d\n\nThat quote just captures the essence of what Foucault is saying in Madness and Civilization. Nonetheless, you can see how this book is yet another example of Foucault questioning a dominant narrative of his time and offering an alternative take on things. But none of these alternative takes would ever be possible if Foucault wasn\u2019t looking at history with some sort of alternative method. Remember, Foucault\u2019s not writing a history of this stuff\u2026outside of a couple exceptions he\u2019d NEVER use the word history to describe it. When it comes to three early books of his: Madness and Civilization, Birth of the Clinic and The Order of Things, HE would call them all Archaeologies\u2026and there are very specific reasons for why he would call them Archaeologies.\u00a0\n\nThink about the job of an Archaeologist for a second\u2026when an Archaeologist goes on a dig\u2026and maybe the task of the day is to excavate some vase from the 1500\u2019s buried deep underground\u2026the job of the Archaeologist is to comb through layers and layers of sediment left behind by the hundreds of years in between the 1500\u2019s and today, and at the end of the job the goal of the archaeologist is to capture a snapshot in time.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, the Archaeologist isn\u2019t concerned with how the vase was made, the way vase makers were thinking about their craft at the time, how the design of the vase evolved out of the vase designs that came before it\u2026no, the task of the archaeologist is to dig through the layers to uncover THIS vase in THIS moment\u2026a snapshot of a very specific point in time.\u00a0\n\nWell, this is similar to what Foucault is trying to do in the three books I just listed\u2026he\u2019s sifting through hundreds of years of ideas\u2026 trying to uncover and dust off moments when things were different\u2026snapshots in time when the discourse and conversations about these topics were just as effective at producing knowledge for people, but people looked at the subjects in an entirely different way than we do today.\u00a0\n\nThis is an important point to understand about Foucault that a lot of people miss out on. They think, okay\u2026here\u2019s Foucault questioning the dominant narrative about these things and offering an alternative narrative about what went down\u2026if only I can point out the flaws in HIS narrative and then make a better narrative of my own then he\u2019ll have no choice but to cower in the corner and admit defeat. I win. But Foucault would absolutely welcome this process and had no desires of HIS narrative being seen as the ultimate way of looking at things. There\u2019s a sense in which the actual point he\u2019s trying to make with his work is that we need to get away from that kind of thinking altogether\u2026that all we\u2019ll EVER have access to are narratives, constantly in competition for the dominant position within society, none of which containing anything close to the Truth about things, just a slightly different angle and way of making sense of the world.\u00a0\n\nBut anyway, eventually Foucault found the Archaeology method that he used all throughout his early career to be extremely limiting\u2026he found that when you\u2019re in the business of just uncovering moments in time throughout history, all you can ever do is compare the discourse surrounding a subject in one period to discourse of another period. In other words, there can be no talk about how one period led to another\u2026just comparisons\u2026and describing how these shifts took place would eventually become and extremely important part of his later work. It is for this reason\u2026that Foucault introduces yet another new method of demystifying the narratives of the past, something he calls a geneaology.\u00a0\n\nYou can picture a geneaology\u2026picture tracing your family tree all the way back to someone that lived in the 1500\u2019s. Not only would you have a snapshot of the person, you\u2019d also have the entire evolution that took place from their world to your world. THIS TYPE of analysis is more in line with what we did on episode one of this series with the book Discipline and Punish\u2026because if you remember: Foucault lays out how the evolution took place from the 1750\u2019s to the 1830\u2019s\u2026from the sovereign age to the disciplinary age\u2026and it\u2019s THIS type of analysis that\u2019s going to occupy almost all of his later work, the geneaology is CRUCIAL if you have the goals of Foucault in his later work\u2026it\u2019s absolutely crucial if you want to call into question the assumption that so many people make, that history has just been a long succession of progress where we use rationality to make things better. The geneaology can show how different periods can give rise to each other for reasons that have nothing to do with rationality.\u00a0\n\nNow, one thing Foucault always said was that if you are going to make one of these geneaologies, always make it about a subject where there seems to be a lot of people agreeing about the way that things are\u2026subjects where there doesn\u2019t seem to be any further discussion required for us to understand how they work.\n\nThis is why Foucault always seems to end up in weird places like prisons and schools and hospitals\u2026nobody\u2019s ever looked at this stuff before like he does\u2026and it\u2019s also the reason why in his final work he decides to question the dominant narratives that surround the topic of human sexuality.\n\nNow, Foucault never finished this work. He died of AIDS in 1984 and just didn\u2019t have time to finish it. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about where he would\u2019ve went had he lived long enough to write the rest of it, but one thing nobody questions is that the beginning of this work mirrors the rest of his work in that he is calling into question dominant narratives that seem to us in our time to be so obvious and based in common sense that they\u2019re practically chiseled into stone, the narrative he takes aim at in The History of Sexuality vol. 1 is something known as the Repressive Hypothesis.\u00a0\n\nThe main argument of the Repressive Hypothesis is that all throughout the 17 and 18th centuries\u2026 people\u2019s thoughts and behaviors surrounding the topic of sexuality have been repressed by people in power\u2026the motives people assign for WHY this happened range considerably\u2026some people say it happened for religious reasons\u2026some say for political gain, some say it was for economic reasons\u2026that for capitalist society to succeed we needed people focused on work rather than the idle task of exploring their sexuality; whatever the reason: the dominant narrative towards the end of the 20th century was that sexuality in the 17 and 1800\u2019s was punctuated by rules\u2026rules where you can\u2019t talk about it\u2026you are to be ashamed of it, you are to feel guilty afterwards for having done it\u2026people in the 20th century were making the case that if we allowed sex to be more natural and less constrained by cultural norms people would be a lot less repressed and a lot more happy.\u00a0\n\nFoucault would strongly disagree with the idea that there\u2019s some \u201cnatural\u201d type of sexuality that\u2019s installed in us\u2026or some scientific \u201ctruth\u201d about the nature of sex that can even be arrived at\u2026I mean, sure, sex, pregnancy, the sexual lives of married couples\u2026these are things that have been talked about almost since the beginning of recorded history\u2026but these things were never referred to over the years as an individual\u2019s \u201csexuality\u201d. Foucault makes the case that if you look back at history, the idea that people possess a set of qualities that make up their own personal sexuality\u2026really is something that\u2019s only existed since the 19th century\u2026when science for the first time in human history directed its gaze towards sex and tried to study and categorize it.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s actually kind of weird to think about\u2026up until around the 19th century\u2026\u00a0nobody ever thought of themselves as heterosexual vs homosexual vs any other form of sexuality\u2026there were people that engaged in certain behaviors\u2026if they lived in a particularly religious society maybe they were guilty of the sin of sodomy but there was never any labeling like we do in today\u2019s world so much\u2026they didn\u2019t take the labels and ways of categorizing people that science came up with and then use them to describe to others who they are as a person\u2026there was no attempt by the science of their time to study and proclaim the TRUTH about sexuality\u2026or what type of sexuality corresponds with human nature, as though what being a human being is is a cookie cutter enterprise. So, on the contrary Foucault would say\u2026sexuality hasn\u2019t been repressed over the centuries\u2026there\u2019s never been a period in our history where sex was studied or talked about MORE! It just can\u2019t happen in public\u2026it happens in private when you\u2019re talking to your therapist or your doctor or some other self-appointed authority on the topic of sexuality.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s been what Foucault calls a, \u201cpolitical, economic and technical incitement to talk about sex.\u201d He actually compares these back room meetings with our doctors or psychologists\u2026 to a modern day confessional booth. In the same way people were asked to atone for their sins by privately talking about their sexuality in explicit detail to a priest in a creepy booth\u2026so too do we ask people in our modern day to give that same information to a scientist or doctor\u2026 whose job it is to study them and tell them whether what they do is normal or abnormal. In the same way the priest controls the discourse surrounding sex, along with it the final judgment on what normal sexual behavior is\u2026so too do scientists, psychologists, doctors control our modern discourse\u2026and when you control the discourse that surrounds a behavior, you control the behavior itself, to Foucault.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot only do we have these scientific confessional booths where we are studied and told whether we\u2019re in need of fixing\u2026but simultaneously we internalize norms given to us by the sciences, accept them as the way we SHOULD be, and then we actually monitor ourselves to make sure we conform to the standard.\u00a0\n\nNow, these points alone could spark some pretty interesting conversation with someone who believes we\u2019ve been repressed for the last 300 years, but the biggest weakness of the Repressive Hypothesis, to Foucault, has nothing to do with any of this stuff\u2026 and\u2026just to come back to a theme common among these post-structuralist thinkers\u2026the problem with the Repressive Hypothesis has to do with the fact that the entire theory is built on top of an understanding of the way power works that is naive, outdated and to continue looking at power in this way knowing what we know now would be delusional.\u00a0\n\nFoucault would say that most people when they think of power, look at it in an overly simplistic way. Most people look at power in the same way we looked at it back when we were living in monarchies in the 1300\u2019s\u2026as though power, is executed from a single source be it a king, a president, the halls of congress, the type of power that says NO to things. The type of power that forces you to do things you don\u2019t want to do. Foucault calls this type of power a bunch of different throughout his work: Contract oppression, sovereign power, repressive power; the most important thing to understand is that this is the type of power that has ultimate authority to take things from you\u2026from taxes, to goods and services to your time\u2026they can ever take your life should they deem it to be necessary. But Foucault thinks despite how common this type of power has been in the past\u2026when it comes to our modern societies, this is just not the kind of power we come face to face with anymore.\u00a0\n\nFoucault would ask, \u201cwhat are the types of power that actually touch you and effect you in your life?\u201d Is it your direct relationship with Donald Trump? Is it a debate you\u2019re having daily with supreme court justices? IS that the type of power that effects you most on a daily basis? No.\u00a0\n\nPower, to Foucault, has undergone a fundamental transformation in the west throughout the last couple hundred years. Power in our modern societies is not something with a stable center that can be identified and stopped. Power in our modern societies is what he calls Capillary. To Foucault, power is an unstable network flowing in all directions from every point at once\u2026we all, whether we realize we\u2019re doing it or not, we\u2019re all exerting our power over everyone else around us every single day.\u00a0\n\nThrough constant surveillance, cultural norms, advertisements, persuasion, suggestion, encouragement and discouragement of certain behaviors we approve or disapprove of, even down to the things you like and share on Facebook, you are constantly defining, redefining and reinforcing the standard of what is normal and what is abnormal. Who should be accepted and listened to and who should be silenced or considered not worthy of being taken seriously. Power, in this way, is incredibly diffuse. Power is not something that lies in the relationship between you and a king or you and Donald Trump. No, in our modern societies, power is something that operates at all levels of society\u2026yes, at the level of public policy that effects everyone, but at the same time at an individual level that only effects you and dictates the narrow set of choices you have to navigate\u2026power is between you and your government, but more relevant to your everyday life it\u2019s between you and your therapist, your boss, your doctor, your teachers, your parents, your friends, your family, your co-workers, the strangers that may judge you in public\u2026really stop for a second and try to get a sense of just how much these people shape who you are as a person.\u00a0\n\nPower is everywhere, to Foucault\u2026but to most people power is invisible. The ability for this power system to change your behavior has become so subtle, the micro tactics of power have become so normalized in your world that most people don\u2019t even notice themselves gradually being shaped into a mold of normalcy like a soldier in boot camp\u2026or like a prisoner in a cell.\n\nIn fact, think of yourself as a prisoner for a second\u2026picture yourself in the Panopticon that we talked about on episode one of this series. Real quick if you don\u2019t remember that was the hypothetical prison devised by Jeremy Bentham where a single guard in the middle can see what the prisoners are doing inside of every cell, but the prisoners can\u2019t ever know when they\u2019re being watched.\u00a0\n\nWhat Foucault is saying\u2026is that if you could somehow get the prisoners to be socialized in such a way that they watched each other, they created a system of norms and expectations, and they had some form of feedback where the prisoners felt judged and rejected when they get out of line\u2026you wouldn\u2019t even need a guard in the center of the Panopticon. That guy could go on vacation because the reality of that world would be to Foucault that the prisoners themselves would police each other far better than any system you could come up with that was implemented by force.\u00a0You don\u2019t need to use repressive power and force people to do anything if you can get them to want to do on their own what you were otherwise going to force them to do.\u00a0Remember, knowledge to Foucault is intrinsically connected to power\u2026and when you have one guard in the center that has access to complete knowledge of everyone\u2019s actions\u2026and a bunch of prisoners in a cell that can\u2019t even see the outside world\u2026this creates a massive imbalance of knowledge, and along with it, an imbalance of power. The prisoners themselves become active, supportive participants in the very system that suppresses them. To Michel Foucault, THIS example is far more comparable to the power model we face in our modern societies and FAR MORE EFFECTIVE than any king, on a throne, sentencing people to death.\u00a0\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, to Foucault, there has been a fundamental shift in the way power is exercised in the west; we\u2019ve moved from this outdated style of sovereign power to a new age that is defined by what he calls \u201cBiopower\u201d\u2026now, why come up with a clever little name like that and why Biopower? Doesn\u2019t bio mean it has something to do with life? Well, yes\u2026yes it does.\u00a0\n\nWhat Foucault\u2019s talking about is similar to what we started to talk about towards the end of last episode\u2026throughout the last 300 years or so, the more science has made society the object of scientific study, the more tactics scientists have come up with to\u00a0\n\n1. optimize life and productivity and\n2. to categorize people within a society.\u00a0\n\nBecause of science\u2026 and the way it tries to organize the world, for the first time in our history we are looking at BRAND NEW ways of objectifying people\u2026things we\u2019ve never really thought about much before\u2026things like the population, birth and death rates, advanced demographics, the prevalence of disease, the happiness index and about 50 other things that we accept as the scientific discourse of our day, and then quietly USE these metrics to determine who we are and how we fit into the bigger picture.\u00a0\n\nThis is why the repressive hypothesis is wrong, to Foucault. Power\u2026is not repressive in our modern world\u2026power is productive. It doesn\u2019t repress and do away with some true or natural sexuality that we all possess deep down\u2026no, power is productive\u2026it PRODUCES\u2026through cultural norms and scientific discourse\u2026the methods we use to even be able to identify and CONCEIVE of our sexuality\u2026but here\u2019s the crazy part: it\u2019s NOT JUST our sexuality.\u00a0\n\nBecause it\u2019s right here\u2026this is a big reason why, to Foucault, the people that are TRULY in power are the thought leaders within the sciences that control the dominant narratives about the way that things are in the universe. Knowledge is intrinsically connected to power\u2026and they\u2019re the ones that produce all the knowledge. They control the parameters, the language, the concepts\u2026they control the entire discourse that everyone uses to determine who they are, what they care about and what things are worth spending effort on. Foucault calls this \u201cBiopower\u201d because:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe exercise of power over living beings no longer carries the threat of death, but instead takes charge of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn other words, Biopower\u2026there is no need anymore whatsoever to threaten people and force them to do things under penalty of death. Not only is that method outdated and inefficient, it\u2019s also entirely transparent when it comes to identifying who is in power. Biopower, in a sense, hijacks the lives of unsuspecting people, and uses the current period\u2019s scientific discourse and cultural norms to turn them into willing participants. Biopower is the type of power that actually effects us in our daily lives.\u00a0\n\nNow, if there\u2019s any part of you that hears this and thinks that the obvious next step is to try to do away with this Biopower, Foucault would probably tell you to rethink your strategy. Power dynamics, at this point, are an inexorable part of the world we live in. You\u2019re never going to get rid of them. No matter how much you resist the micro tactics of power, no matter how much you question the dominant narratives of your time, all you can EVER hope for\u2026.is a world that is a little more tolerable. All you can ever hope for is a different set of dominant narratives that may, for all we know in the long run oppress more people than the CURRENT set of dominant narratives. Fight all you want against power, against narratives, against meta-narratives, fight all you want\u2026but before you do, Foucault would want us all to take a second to stop and understand\u2026what you\u2019re replacing those meta-narratives with.\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_94": {"date": "2019-5-23", "text": "Posted on May 23, 2019\nEpisode 127 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #127 on Gilles Deleuze. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo in 1983, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari release the first book of what would eventually be a two volume series that aimed at discussing the political reality of the modern western world\u2026the TITLE of the series\u2026ALLUDING to the situation they were about to describe in the western world\u2026was Capitalism and Schizophrenia. Now, the foreward of the first book\u2026was written by someone that we\u2019ve recently talked about on this show\u2026Michel Foucault. Now Foucault, when writing the foreward to this book\u2026talks about how the 20th century has been marked by a whole bunch of philosophers looking back, trying to warm over and reimagine the work of Freud and Marx\u2026 in an attempt to arrive at some sort of synthesis\u2026some new interpretation or combination of these older ideas that can provide us with a new perspective moving forward\u2026remember Freud and Marx are seen as the sort of proto-structuralists that foreshadowed the structuralism of the 20th century. Freud, through the introduction of the concept of the unconscious mind\u2026showed how it was possible that fundamental parts of your character and preferences and motivations can come from places that you\u2019re COMPLETELY unaware of, at least consciously. Marx, through his superstructure theory we\u2019ve talked about showed how it was possible that things that are produced within a society, including ideas, always emerge first out of an economic climate that people are born into. Lot of philosophers were going back and looking at the work of both of these thinkers\u2026we\u2019ve seen examples of this in the work of some of the Frankfurt School\u2026Marcuse, for example, and his reworking of Freud in Eros and Civilization\u2026or his new, Hegelian interpretation of Marx that tried to breathe new life into some of those older ideas.\n\nBut Foucault says that two people who DIDN\u2019T go this route\u2026are Deleuze and Guattari. Remember, Deleuze, as a postmodernist, would NEVER center his philosophy around the thinking of Freud or Marx. See, to Deleuze, to think of yourself\u2026to think of your thought in terms of being a Freudian\u2026or a Marxist..is just incredibly naive at least to a postmodernist that isn\u2019t interested in sweeping grand narratives like that. To Deleuze, to go back and try to microwave up some leftover Freud and Marx to find new some ideas moving forward\u2026you\u2019re TRAPPING yourself in modernity. Freud and Marx are in many ways trapped in modernity\u2026and if you relegate yourself to an ism\u2026whether it\u2019s Freudianism or Marxism or anything\u2026the best you will EVER have to Deleuze is a single vantage point\u2026the best you\u2019ll ever do is to see the universe from one angle and then spend the rest of your life arguing for why YOUR angle is THE angle everybody else should be viewing it from.\n\nSee because again, Deleuze is a philosopher of new ideas\u2026we saw how he called into question the entire history of ontology when he was searching for new ideas there\u2026well he does the exact same thing\u2026 when he turns his focus towards the political realm. See if it seems like the modern political landscape doesn\u2019t have any new perspectives being offered\u2026if it feels like it\u2019s mostly made up of the same groups having the same arguments with each other over and over again, well, that\u2019s because for hundreds of years we\u2019ve been looking at things from the same angle over and over again. The political landscape is similarly trapped in modernity. Deleuze is going to call for us to look at things from a different angle, and by different he means different from the long classical liberal tradition spanning from the work of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau of always viewing politics through the lens of the individual.\n\nThe individual with their individual desires, individual needs, individual issues that effect them\u2026thinking about political change in terms of an individual vote and how a candidate or the government is going to bring about a world that fulfills what they individually see as important. But Deleuze is going to ask: could we be looking at politics in a completely different way? We always look at things in terms of old, worn out political categories like the individual\u2026but also the state, society, nationality, race\u2026but is it possible to look at politics from a perspective that is much more adaptive and fluid than any single option like that\u2026maybe one that can change in a moment and see things from a variety of different perspectives simultaneously\u2026instead of our tendency which has always been to pick a single perspective and exalt it onto a pedestal as \u201cthe way that things are\u201d.\n\nWhen you look at things in the world solely in terms of the individual, or any of these other traditional, rigid political categories\u2026you can miss out on so many other perspectives that might reveal to you an interconnectedness of all of these complex systems that makes hyper focusing on any single one perspective seem like a waste of time\u2026and if this reminds you of the relationship between Deleuze\u2019s ontology of difference and the traditional ontologies that have existed throughout history\u2026you may be starting to understand his approach here.\n\nNow just to be clear\u2026Deleuze is NOT saying that we SHOULDN\u2019T be looking at things through the lens of the individual, or society or the state or whatever\u2026what he\u2019s saying is that we should recognize these things to be what they are: SINGLE perspectives. We can\u2019t limit ourselves to a single perspective, and this is part of the reason Deleuze and Guattari introduce another approach towards these political units that we view everything through\u2026Deleuze and Guattari ask us to consider the world instead through the lens of what they call machines.\n\nSo what are machines? Well, it\u2019s important to note right at the outset that Deleuze and Guattari are introducing the term \u201cmachine\u201d to specifically try to get away from the common way of thinking about this stuff in their time: viewing things in terms of the individual subject\u2026the SUBJECT is what they\u2019re trying to get away from for a number of reasons, NOT ONLY because they\u2019re trying to get away from thinking about politics through this conventional, classical liberal tradition that we\u2019ve been looking at it through for hundreds of years\u2026but also because when somebody says the word subject and defines people that way\u2026then it becomes extremely easy for someone to mistake subject\u2026for consciousness. To mistakenly think that when someone talks about a subject as a political unit\u2026what they\u2019re referencing is really just the individual consciousnesses of people. This is CLEARLY an oversimplification, when we\u2019re talking about political change there\u2019s CLEARLY more that Deleuze and Guattari want to reference other than just consciousness, so they sort of distance themselves by introducing this new concept of \u201cmachine\u201d that they define much more broadly.\n\nThe term \u201cmachine\u201d is used in multiple different ways over the course of multiple different works. To define what a machine is in a single sentence is impossible. Deleuze and Guattari themselves often talk about machines as total multiplicity\u2026as not definable by the sum of their parts. So I\u2019m going to give metaphors and examples, but maybe the best place to insert ourselves into this discussion about machines from the outside is to just talk for a few about machines generally. So we\u2019ve already mentioned how machines can be seen as a unit, or an entity that we can use to think about how political change occurs in the world. Well, one way to CLARIFY that would be to say that we can think of machines as entities\u2026within a given political landscape or the world for that matter\u2026that seek connections with other machines in an attempt to bring about a particular actuality. Now, that may sound abstract and like it\u2019s difficult to understand what they mean, but by \u201cactuality\u201d they\u2019re referencing the work of Bergson and his theory of time that we talked about last time with the distinction between the virtual and the actual. Machines, and everything that falls under that heading, not only actualize the political reality we live in, but ALL reality.\n\nSo just at first glance already we can see that Deleuze is trying to get people to think more broadly about what they think of as an entity that is trying to bring about political change in the world\u2026maybe it\u2019s not as narrow as we\u2019ve been looking at things for the past couple hundred years\u2026to Deleuze and Guattari the political landscape is NOT just a bunch of individuals interacting with each other trying to get people to vote a certain way. By using this BROADER definition of \u201cmachines\u201d that are seeking connections\u2026they\u2019re offering a much more versatile political unit to view things through\u2026one that accounts for things that are CLEARLY NOT individuals\u2026 but nonetheless have an undeniable agenda towards bringing about political change\u2026quick example before we talk some more about machines, political movements\u2026let me explain:\n\nSo individuals are examples of one TYPE of machine that exists. A group\u2026would be an example of another type of machine. These two things are examples of machines in the sense that they are entities seeking connections with other machines trying to bring about an actuality\u2026they\u2019re machines in that they weren\u2019t created by anything for an EXTREMLY particular purpose\u2026and what I mean is that an important aspect of a machine to Deleuze and Guattari is that it DOESN\u2019T have a fixed purpose and can change its goals or desires at any time. This is where things start to get interesting when it comes to how we look at the moving parts that are bringing about political change in the world\u2026because based on this criteria for what classifies a \u201cmachine\u201d\u2026couldn\u2019t we think of things like social or political movements as machines in their own right as well? I mean, they TOO weren\u2019t created with a rigid, inflexible purpose in mind\u2026they aren\u2019t beholden to a fixed identity\u2026we could say a movement is JUST as much an entity that seeks connections with other machines, like people, for the sake of producing something.\n\nFor example, take the movement of environmentalism\u2026or the green movement or save the planet or whatever you want to call it. This movement can be thought of as an extremely complex machine, connected to millions of other machines\u2026 people, groups, moving parts\u2026and this machine is always seeking MORE connections\u2026picture environmentalism meetups, tree plantings, speeches, public service announcements, signs, bumper stickers\u2026a community potluck where we all get togethers and recycle some stuff\u2026 consider the fact this machine is always embedding itself into OTHER groups leveraging OTHER machines to be able to bring about its OWN actuality\u2026picture the NFL having their players where a green wrist band to promote environmental awareness\u2026or a car company changing their exhaust system so that it\u2019s more environmentally friendly. Not only that, but very similar to what an individual or a group is in a given moment\u2026a movement in a given moment is defined by the sum total of the connections that make it up IN that moment, connections that CAN change and are CONSTANTLY always changing\u2026once again there IS no fixed identity\u2026like these other types of machines a movement is flexible\u2026it has a fluidity to it\u2026it can evolve and adapt.\n\nNow that said, machines are NOT just limited to individuals, groups or political movements. There are of course tons of other examples of abstract political processes that can be thought of as machines\u2026but the REALLY important thing that I want to emphasize is the fact that machines go in the other direction as well. Just as a group of machines (a collection of people) can make up a larger machine in the form of a political movement\u2026collections of machines make up the individual. We are ourselves a complex collection of machines and their processes. Deleuze and Guattari give the example of a new mother\u2026we can even think about machines at the level of bodily processes\u2026they say the breast of the new mother can be thought of as a machine just as the mouth of the newborn baby can be thought of as a machine\u2026each seeking connections with other machines and each using the connections WITH other machines to actualize themselves\u2026 Machines connect with other machines to ACTUALIZE reality. But the BIG SHIFT here from the traditional way we\u2019ve thought about things: Thinking about political change in terms of machines\u2026 which are themselves complex groups of connections driving other machines which are also groups of connections allows for a level of flexibilty that traditional political categories like the individual just don\u2019t offer.\n\nThe famous quote from the book about machines is:\n\n\u201cEverywhere it [what Freud called the id] is machines \u2013 real ones, not figurative ones: machines driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary couplings and connections. . . . we are all handymen: each with his little machines.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s the famous quote, the common EXAMPLE people give to talk about how these machines actually work is to consider a bicycle.\n\nSo a bicycle is a machine. By itself\u2026the bicycle just kind of sits there\u2026purely virtual in terms of its potential, when a bike sits by itself in a garage it doesn\u2019t have a SLIVER of hope to become actualized in any way. What the bicycle needs\u2026are OTHER machines around it to make connections with\u2026those connections determining what actuality is going to be realized\u2026so for example, a bike doesn\u2019t have a fixed identity. Say that the machine of a bicycle connects with the machine of a human being. That person could do a THOUSAND different things with that bicycle\u2026they could ride it around as transportation\u2026that might be the first thing we think of\u2026but think of all the other ways that bike could be actualized\u2026they could take the bike apart and sell the parts at a bike shop\u2026they could give the bike to charity\u2026they could see the bike as a sculpted work of art they\u2019re going to put on display at their house\u2026they could name the bike\u2026and think of it as their new imaginary best friend\u2026they could beat somebody to death with the bike\u2026they could hook the bike up to some sort of stationary treadmill situation that generates power when you turn the pedals\u2026the point is: there is no FIXED purpose of a bicycle\u2026and it\u2019s only through it\u2019s connections with other machines around it\u2026that its momentary purpose becomes actualized. Think about the parallels to individuals, groups and political movements here.\n\nPolitical movements are machines\u2026people are machines\u2026Think of how often political movements USE the individual human beings that make up the movement like this person we\u2019re talking about uses this bicycle. Once again as Deleuze says, it\u2019s everywhere\u2026machines driving machines\u2026machines being DRIVEN by machines. Not only that\u2026think of how possible it is for an individual\u2026especially one in a position of leadership\u2026to use the machine of a political movement to bring about something for their OWN personal gain. Machines driving machines.\n\nWhen we remove the default humanism of the way we traditionally have thought about politics\u2026and instead think about it in terms of complex groups of connections interacting with other groups of connections\u2026we open up the door to new perspectives that see things from a different angle, for example, consider for a second the Earth as a machine\u2026and instead of thinking about it in a solely humanistic way\u2026consider the slightly different perspective of seeing the movement of environmentalism as the machine of the earth, driving other machines that are part of what makes it up\u2026people\u2026 to make further connections that promote a certain agenda that is in its best interests. This is a very simple example of how thinking in terms of machines as political units, opens up different perspectives than just looking at it in terms of how people feel about it.\n\nFew more important points about this concept of a machine. Deleuze says that machines are always connected to other machines\u2026and what this means is that machines are always productive in some sense, but again ONLY when connected to other machines. Deleuze and Guattari at this point introduce a concept that is a driving force behind machines and what motivates them to produce things or seek connections with other machines in the first place. See, as far as they can tell, this\u2026 driving force is NOT ONLY the driving force behind machines and their behavior\u2026it seems to them to be a fundamental driver of ALL LIFE in the universe. Something they call \u201cdesire production\u201d\u2026now, the name desire production is pretty transparently just a mash up of the driving force of desire from Freud and the driving force of production from Marx\u2026but Deleuze and Guattari aren\u2019t looking at the work of Freud and Marx so that they can rework their ideas and come up with some sort of synthesis\u2026they look at their ideas and launch one of the most radical critiques of their work in existence\u2026people sometimes go so far as to say what Deleuze and Guattari do is not so much critique their work\u2026but subsume it.\n\nProbably the best place to start is with their REINTERPRETATION of both Freud\u2019s concept of desire and Marx\u2019s production.\n\nSee traditionally the way people have thought about desire is that people always desire something that\u2019s LACKING in their life. The LACK of something is what creates the desire to produce in the individual. But Deleuze and Guattari are going to question this\u2026they\u2019re going to say that desire and production are in fact\u2026 default, fundamental properties of what it is to be a machine at all\u2026which includes\u2026. what it is to be a human being. Desire DRIVES these connections between machines\u2026and in the same sense, put a little more dramatically by Deleuze\u2026desire PRODUCES reality. Desire is the vehicle for changing things from the virtual to the actual. Desire isn\u2019t a motivating force that is responding to a LACK of something\u2026desire production is INHERENT to life itself\u2026think of desire production as Deleuze\u2019s version of Nietzsche\u2019s will to power.\n\nSo, this is the reason the first volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia is titled Anti-Oedipus\u2026To Deleuze, just as there\u2019s no transcendent governing body that dictates the rules of ontology\u2026there\u2019s no transcendent governing body external to you like Freud\u2019s Oedipus that dictates what desires you feel or what connections you\u2019re going to seek as a desiring machine. Desire isn\u2019t something dictated by some standard of living outside of yourself and what you\u2019re LACKING in relation to that standard\u2026desire is a natural process of experimentation. What this ALSO implies is that desire is NOT something that is located deep inside the psyche of the individual\u2026what desire REALLY is\u2026is a social force. What Deleuze is trying to do here\u2026is get us to RETHINK the concept of desire\u2026so that we might be able to rescue it from these rigid, outdated theories and instead see it for what it actually is to him: the source of revolution. The ONLY real source of revolution that we have. This desire production\u2026fundamental to all life\u2026the very thing that drives machines to take action turning the virtual into the actual\u2026desire is revolutionary\u2026and it\u2019s been suppressed over the years not only by the work of Freud, but any form of psychoanalysis that relies on transcendent, external concepts\u2026Jacques Lacan is another target of theirs\u2026they\u2019re calling into question this older FREUDIAN, \u201clack based\u201d view of desire\u2026and what they\u2019re going to say is that this Oedipal way of looking at desire has very real consequences on the societies that believe in it. Because IN these societies\u2026desire becomes something that gets turned inward, towards your immediate family\u2026what you think of as your desires\u2026is really just you misinterpreting some deeply rooted psycho-sexual framework that you don\u2019t quite understand\u2026the result of this on a social level being\u2026that the vast majority of the desire of the individual gets interpreted inwardly\u2026with any excess desire that someone might have, however small of an amount that may be\u2026well that is the only desire that can eventually spill over into the social and political realms trying to bring about change\u2026but here\u2019s the thing: even that VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF DESIRE that spills over is ALWAYS subject to the limitations of the social and political realms which are themselves to Deleuze and Guattari conveniently controlled by the forces of Capitalism.\n\nNow\u2026in an interview in the 1990\u2019s towards the end of his life Deleuze says that he still refers to himself as a Marxist. To people unfamiliar with the rest of his work and the rest of the interview\u2026this has caused some to label Deleuze as some sort of postmodernist neo-marxist type. But even a cursory reading of the rest of his work would no doubt make someone really confused\u2026how can this guy be a Marxist\u2026when he spends so much time in his work talking about how rigid, hierarchical systems like Marxism are not even CLOSE to the full story? The answer is that Deleuze is not a Marxist in the traditional sense of the word\u2026he was speaking in a philosophical context\u2026that in the sense that so much of the work of Marx was dedicated to an analysis and critique of Capitalism\u2026for anyone that wants to do meaningful work in the field of economics during his time\u2026you\u2019re PROBABLY going to want to start from an analysis and critique of Capitalism. Which is what he and Guattari DO in Capitalism and Schizophrenia\u2026so IF throughout the course of their two books they have anything negative to say about Capitalism\u2026this isn\u2019t coming from the perspective of some tribal, hateful Marxist that wants to do away with one rigid system and replace it with another\u2026no their perspective is more like: just because Capitalism is better than the Feudal system\u2026does not mean that we\u2019re done talking about economics for the rest of time. How else are we going to make the world a better place if we don\u2019t critique the dominant ideas of our time? Who is going to critique them other than the dominant economic and political philosophers of our time? The aim of Capitalism and Schizophrenia is less a hit piece on Capitalism like so many works of the past\u2026and more an analysis on what natural effects Capitalism has on the world and what problems, if any, are created by that.\n\nNothing showcases this fact more than all the GOOD things Deleuze and Guattari have to say about Capitalism. They credit capitalism with drastically improving the lives of almost everyone on the planet by abolishing the hierarchical rules and power structures of the middle ages. You know, if you\u2019re a peasant\u2026living under the Feudal system\u2026there are tons of rules, that are imposed upon you by the Aristocracy and land owners. Now if at any point you don\u2019t like those rules\u2026or one of those rules makes your life absolutely miserable\u2026there\u2019s really not much you can do\u2026you can\u2019t request a transfer to another plot of land. You can\u2019t save up and buy a different plot of land where you make your own rules. But in Capitalism this isn\u2019t the case and this is often given by proponents of Capitalism for why it\u2019s the best economic system we have\u2026show me another economic system\u2026where if a worker is alienated or miserable because of their job they can work hard, apply themselves and go get some OTHER job that they enjoy more with no detriment to society as a whole. THAT\u2019S A STRENGTH\u2026of Capitalism over the Feudal system and Deleuze and Guattari would agree with that. What they\u2019d probably say next though is that just because somebody has the freedom to change jobs and not be subjected to the rules of a landowner does not mean that they\u2019re free\u2026or that Capitalism as an economic system is impervious to criticism.\n\nYes, Capitalism has dismantled feudalism, or as they say \u201cdeterritorialized\u201d these rigid rule systems people had to live under in the past\u2026but then after deterritorializing these rules\u2026Capitalism then reterritorialized it with an axiomatic\u2026or more SIMPLY put\u2026Capitalism, notably the world of banking and finance, dictate every narrow parameter that human beings have to navigate in their lives. We\u2019re going to talk about how in the next episode, along with Deleuze\u2019s concept of looking at the universe in terms of different \u201cflows\u201d and a constant process of deterritorialization and reterritorialization\u2026but how Deleuze and Guattari ARRIVE at this unique analysis of Capitalism and how things change and connect together in the universe is by LOOKING at the universe through a different lens than any philosopher that had come before them.\n\nThis is one of the most important concepts in ALL of the work of Deleuze\u2026his concept of the Rhizome. This is a good way to end the episode\u2026something to think about throughout the week so that next time you can understand where they\u2019re coming from. Now a common thread that by this point you\u2019ve no doubt noticed in Deleuze is that he\u2019s looking back at our history as a species and how we\u2019ve looked at things in terms of what HE sees as rigid, narrow categories\u2026and he\u2019s trying to offer a DIFFERENT perspective\u2026one where we step OUTSIDE the traditional ways we\u2019ve thought about things like ontology or politics\u2026and by considering different approaches\u2026by looking at things in terms of difference\u2026the hope is that we might be able to see that traditional accounts of the way things are don\u2019t even come close to telling us the full story.\n\nHe compares the dogmatic way that we\u2019ve traditionally thought about things to a tree. Now, a tree\u2026is very straightforward\u2026it is rooted in one place. Not moving. There are clear lines of demarcation between the different PARTS of that tree. There are the roots\u2026the roots give way to the trunk\u2026the trunk gives way to the branches, the branches give way to the leaves. There is a clear beginning middle and end to that tree and the tree is structured in a hierarchical way\u2026 much like our systems of ideas from the past like we\u2019ve talked about over the course of the series, be it in ontology or Freud\u2019s psychology or anything else. Deleuze would ALSO want us to consider that the different PARTS of this hierarchy work together in the tree. The roots gather moisture and nutrients from the soil, sends them up to the trunk which support the branches, the branches support the leaves that collect sunlight and oxygen and just as the rest of the tree supports the leaves the leaves support the rest of the tree. In other words, this tree is a static system\u2026with well defined parts that perform specific functions\u2026and the structure of the tree mirrors the structure of the way we\u2019ve traditionally thought about ontology or politics. For example a deeply rooted system incapable of movement\u2026with well defined parts that make it up and perform different functions, for example\u2026the individual, the state, the economy, laws\u2026these things all work together and play their part within a system.\n\nSo we have this great visual of a static, rigidly defined tree that Deleuze compares to the way we often think about politics\u2026but a more ACCURATE way of looking at what that tree really is, to Deleuze is to think of it as a single pattern\u2026we shouldn\u2019t think of the hierarchy and \u201ctree\u201d of our modern political system as\u2026\u201dthe way that things are\u201d\u2026but instead\u2026 think of it as a single pattern\u2026.that happens to be the way we talk about politics in this particular day and age\u2026there are countless other ways we might otherwise be talking about politics, countless other angles we might view it from\u2026which is why if you wanted to come up with a plant based analogy describing our modern political landscape that was more accurate\u2026take that tree\u2026 that embodies the narrow way we\u2019ve looked at politics for hundreds of years\u2026pull the entire tree out of the ground roots and all\u2026shrink it by about a hundred times until it\u2019s the size of a baseball\u2026and instead picture that tree as just a tiny part of a giant wall of vines and leaves spanning off in every direction. This\u2026is where Deleuze\u2019s concept of the rhizome comes into play.\n\nSo, a rhizome\u2026in the world of plants\u2026is an extremely chaotic and unpredictable root structure. Actually depending on the baggage you\u2019re bringing along with the meaning of the word chaos it may not be the best way to describe it\u2026and I think technically a rhizome is a subterranean plant stem, not a root\u2026 but look none of these labels really matter. The point is: look up a picture of one. A Rhizome is a root structure that doesn\u2019t grow in a uniform direction or pattern, like a tree\u2026its root system is not fixed to one place in the ground, like a tree\u2026when you look at a rhizome there\u2019s no clear beginning middle and end to what\u2019s going on\u2026the rhizome at any point in time can sprout a new root out of the side of it in a completely different direction, then THAT root can have OTHER roots growing out of IT seemingly randomly in all different directions\u2026what follows from this, naturally, is that networks of root systems become formed\u2026and then these random root offshoots can often times connect one network of roots to another network of roots sometimes in bizarre ways. THIS\u2026is a much more accurate metaphor when it comes to how thought, ideas and movements link together. Think of the visual of the giant wall covered by vines again\u2026where is the CENTER of that vine? Where is the beginning, middle and end to that vine? There ISN\u2019T one, to Deleuze, just as there\u2019s no beginning, middle and end to systems of ideas\u2026just people getting tunnel vision on one little SECTION of the wall and then making a case for why they have the whole wall figured out\u2026this is the mistake of the philosophers of the last two thousand years\u2026when someone creates a hierarchical system of ideas\u2026when someone makes a tree\u2026all that a tree is is a blocked rhizome. One little section of the wall masquerading as the WHOLE wall. Consider two networks of roots that may in the past have been thought of as COMPLETELY different from each other. Political power and linguistics. So in the past we may have studied these very different fields and thought of them as completely separate from eachother\u2026how often throughout history have we seen someone who specializes in linguistics writing extensive commentary on political power or vice versa? But on closer examination consider how many ways these two root systems are connected\u2026consider how ideas in linguistics often dictate the boundaries of how we\u2019re even able to TALK about politics\u2026they dictate the boundaries of what we can even bring up as a criticism of people in power\u2026they dictate how we even THINK about our relationship to political power\u2026but it goes the other way as well\u2026think of how often people in political power will try to control the language that is used to be able to get elected or stay in power\u2026consider how calculated down to the word their use of language is in speeches to harness political power\u2026to think of linguistics and political power as two distinct fields that can be studied and fully understood in isolation from each other, is an old way of thinking. There are roots that connect these networks of roots, and roots that connect both of these networks with countless OTHER networks of roots. When you pay attention\u2026and look closely\u2026to Deleuze\u2026the universe is a rhizome.\n\nRhizomes are everywhere\u2026not just in human ideas. Sure, there\u2019s the actual rhizome and the wall of ivy and many other plants\u2026but consider the countless other examples all around us: ant colonies, rat burrows, termite nests\u2026vast ecosystems, human cultures, nervous systems, the layout of a city, the behavior of the people WITHIN the city\u2026yes, this is ALSO the development of human ideas\u2026books are rhizomes, connected to other books, documentaries, magazines, movies\u2026philosophical systems are rhizomes connected to everything around them. This rhizomatic way of looking at the universe to Deleuze\u2026can get us out of this rigid way of thinking of philosophy in terms of hierarchies and history in terms of it being this linear thing that progresses from beginning to middle to end\u2026and instead understand that our systems of ideas are often MASSIVELY interconnected\u2026and that history is not some single line of progression but instead many DIFFERENT histories all progressing and regressing at extremely different rates.\n\nBut just to illustrate how impossible it is to nail Deleuze down like one of the philosophers of the past\u2026despite all of this talk about the rhizome\u2026he still has no problem at all\u2026with the tree. We\u2019ll talk about why at the beginning of next episode thank you for listening\u2026I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_95": {"date": "2019-5-23", "text": "Posted on May 23, 2019\nEpisode 128 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #128 on Gilles Deleuze. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo all throughout this series we\u2019ve talked about different ways Deleuze and Guattari want to get us out of thinking about things in the traditional, rigid ways we\u2019ve approached things in the past. They\u2019ve asked us to think about ontology differently, politics differently, they\u2019ve questioned the individual, humanistic perspective we typically view everything through\u2026they\u2019ve even asked us to question things like the nature of time and the linear way that we typically view history as though it\u2019s been this straightforward crescendo of progress that\u2019s all been leading to this moment\u2026right now. So it will probably come as no surprise that in the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia titled A Thousand Plateaus\u2026 Deleuze and Guatarri are going to want to do this SAME THING in other areas\u2026they want to offer a completely different way to think about the questions surrounding\u2026 social theory\u2026or if you wanted to get all Webster\u2019s Dictionary on people: social theory, meaning the analytical frameworks, or paradigms, that are used to study and interpret social phenomena, Deleuze and Guattari want to offer a different way of thinking about all this\u2026and by different what I mean is, different from the four or five ways philosophers have always approached these questions in the past. I mean, just on this show we\u2019ve already seen tons of examples of philosophers trying their hands at social theory and almost every time they seem to fail miserably.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen people try to actually DESIGN the entire society from the ground up. Think Plato\u2019s Republic\u2026social engineering on a massive scale to the point of carving out and designing social classes and even grooming and designing the minds of all of the future leaders from the moment they\u2019re born. Think St. Augustine\u2019s City of God in the 5th century. Think Thomas More\u2019s Utopia in the 16th century. We\u2019ve seen TONS of examples of this\u2026but we\u2019ve also seen OTHER attempts at social theory. When we get to the Rennaisance and the Enlightenment\u2026 the focus is less on coming up with some grand design and more on seeing things through the lens of the individual, and subjectivity, and what this leads to is social contract theory\u2026through the work of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and many others basic elements of society are structured around an agreement, signed at birth, between the individual citizen\u2026and the sovereign. This agreement lays out the parameters for how many of the relationships between things within that society are going to function. Social theory\u2026 has been talked about extensively from a variety of different angles, but even still: Deleuze and Guattari think that we\u2019re still missing out on a LOT\u2026when it comes to other ways that elements of society connect and work together and they\u2019re going to ask us to instead take a look at society through the lens of what they refer to as \u201cflows\u201d. General theory about society, to Deleuze and Guattari, can be understood in terms of a theory of what they call flows, and how they relate to each other. So obviously the first thing we gotta talk about is: what is a flow. Why do we need some new term to talk about the way social phenomena unfold\u2026well the reason is fairly similar to what we talked about last episode in the realm of politics.\n\nSee in the same way it would be a mistake to only limit ourselves to the long tradition of looking at political change from the perspective of the individual\u2026and how by broadening that perspective, by seeing the world as a complex laboratory of machines using other machines and making connections, actualizing the political reality\u2026look, one of the points from last episode was that by seeing political change from this broader, more versatile angle we see perspectives and potential solutions that we just can\u2019t possibly see when we look at things solely from the perspective of the classical liberal tradition of individualism. Well, so too when it comes to social theory, and the broader perspective Deleuze and Guattari want us to consider by looking at things in terms of flows. Let\u2019s talk about flows\u2026We all already have a frame of reference to understand what they mean by flows, because we all already use the word \u201cflow\u201d in a BUNCH of different everyday situations, to describe the way things sort of \u201cmove along\u201d in the world we live in\u2026the fact is Deleuze and Guattari first develop this idea of looking at society in terms of flows when they\u2019re studying the field of economics\u2026and then once you see flows in the context of economics\u2026the concept of a \u201cflow\u201d just kind of expands outward from there and seems to apply to all the other different areas of society.\n\nDaniel Entier (on-tee-yay) in his analysis of Deleuze describes a pretty good starting point for thinking about flows from this economic perspective\u2026he says \u201cfrom the economic point of view, we can call flows the values of the quantities of goods and services or money that are transmitted from one pole to another\u201d Now, when it comes to these two \u201cpoles\u201d that are being talked about\u2026think of them as two bookends where BETWEEN these two bookends there is some economic flow occurring, whatever that may be. For example, the flow of economic transactions between an employer and an employee\u2026or between a store and a manufacturer\u2026these economic flows alternatively could extend into the realm of finance\u2026think of the movement of transactions or the flow between a bank or an investor and some machine trying to actualize a new business venture. There are even economic flows going on INTERNAL to businesses or people\u2019s personal finances\u2026think of the term \u201ccash flow\u201d think of the \u201cflow\u201d of material resources or inventory based on what is being received or sold. The larger point here to understand and the reason this is gonna apply to all these other areas of society is that in all of these cases MOVEMENT is occurring, and we seem to be able to see this movement, or flow at all different levels of analysis, just like machines when we were talking about political change last episode\u2026remember, by looking at things in terms of machines we aren\u2019t just LOOKING at things through the lens of the individual\u2026yes, individuals are machines, but again, so are groups, companies, organizations, spiritual movements, planets\u2026but it goes the other way we can think of parts of our bodies as machines, we can think of bodily processes as machines, the very collections of cells that make us up: Political change can be understood by looking at this interaction between and confluence of machines at all levels\u2026well in the same way we can understand social phenomena in terms of these flows and how they interact with each other at all levels.\n\nBut again, flows are not just economic\u2026this is just where Deleuze and Guattari identify them for the first time\u2026so let\u2019s expand on that\u2026we\u2019ve talked about economic flows, you know: the movement of money between parties, movement of capital in finance\u2026But in another area a flow could easily be the flow of immigration, the movement of new citizens into a country. That\u2019s a social phenomenon. Another example could be the flow of commodities, the movement\u2026 of oil or electricity or coffee or any commodity for that matter\u2026that\u2019s another aspect of society. We could look at the flow of traffic. The flow of ideas from person to person. The flow of how citizens live their lives within a particular city. We can even think of flow in terms of the raw human excrement flowing through the sewage facilities of a city and this is not me making some sick joke\u2026this is actually an example they use in the book. Because flows, like machines, are EXTREMELY varied in terms of their definitions and exist at what seems to be all levels of a society. Now in the interest of understanding what flows are\u2026I want to point out some similarities between all these examples of flows that were just laid out, and I think the best way to do that is through a metaphor\u2026let\u2019s compare ALL OF these flows \u2026to the flow of water in a river.\n\nOK, so if we think of a river as a metaphor for what a flow is\u2026we can analyze that river as philosophers have traditionally done in the past\u2026there are of course ways to break down that river into a bunch of different parts, give each of those parts an identity, and then study the identities of all those different parts to try to understand the river better. But there\u2019s a sense in which if you were to ONLY look at the river in this way\u2026 you\u2019d be potentially missing out on a layer of understanding ABOUT that river that you\u2019d only have access to if you were looking at the entire river as a whole process, or movement or flow. This has been one of the big mistakes of so many great philosophers of the past when looking at social theory. They pay way too much attention to prescribing identities to the things that are moving and not enough attention to lots of OTHER important factors\u2026such as, why the river is moving in the direction it is at all. What is responsible for that movement? Why is there a flow between these two poles in particular? Another thing that often gets overlooked by philosophers that are overly concerned with the identity of things\u2026is that just like in the case of a river\u2026human intervention often fundamentally changes the nature of the flow, and so often in the past, this has distorted our ability to see things in the world clearly. Just to clarify what Deleuze and Guattari are talking about here let\u2019s return to the example of a river as a flow, and as we talk about this remember we are NOT JUST talking about large scale cultural movements here\u2026again flows exist at all levels down to things that might seem insignificant to outdated ways of looking at social phenomena.\n\nBut back to the metaphor: So a river is almost NEVER\u2026just some uninhibited stream of liquid that sort of meanders anywhere that it happens to go. There is a specific reason that river is moving in the direction that it is, at the SPEED that it is. For example, a glacier melting on the top of a mountain and gravity pulling water to its lowest point. What this means is, just like flows we can spot in society, there is always some sort of force responsible for why this flow exists between these two poles\u2026WHY is there a flow of immigration into a particular country? WHY is there a flow of traffic to THIS part of the city at THIS particular time? What force is driving the flow and spreading of ideas among members of a culture? Or from generation to generation? What force determines which ideas have the most movement and at what speed those ideas move? Also, picture the river again\u2026water flowing between two poles in a specific direction\u2026well if at any point that flow of water becomes inconvenient when it comes to ANY activity we want to engage in as human beings, what do we do?\u2026we intervene, we fundamentally CHANGE the nature of that flow\u2026 so that it corresponds with some demand we have. We put up a dam\u2026and stop the flow of the river altogether. We redirect the flow of water into a different direction. We change the grade of the river bed to adjust the speed in certain areas. We build a bridge so we can cross the river in a particular place. So in the case of the river\u2026human intervention plays a vital role in determining how that flow looks and functions\u2026and this is exactly the case\u2026 when it comes to all the other flows we\u2019ve talked about. We have immigration laws and procedures to regulate levels of citizenship. We have market regulations to govern economic flows. We have traffic laws and streetlights and signs to regulate the flow of traffic. We have sewage systems and processing facilities that carry out what we\u2019ve decided needs to get done with the Mississippi river of human excrement that would otherwise be flowing down the street. Market regulations to economic flows are like the dam is to the river in our metaphor. Traffic laws are to the traffic flow as redirecting the course of the river is in our metaphor. These interventions, in the language of Deleuze and Guattari as we talked about last time\u2026are the effects of the constant process that\u2019s going on\u2026of territorialization, deterritorialization and then reterritorialization by machines interacting with these flows. The key to a new level of understanding about how society functions, to Deleuze, lies in understanding these flows, these forces of movement that exist between polarities, how these flows interact with eachother, and how they are shaped and changed by this constant territorialization by machines.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari give an example of this interaction that occurs between flows and the machines that are making connections, and territorializing those flows\u2026and it\u2019s through this example that they illustrate an extremely important point if we want to view social phenomena by thinking in terms of flows\u2026these machines\u2026 when seeking connections and creating this territory\u2026in a sense BECOME PART OF the flow. The same way a dam becomes a part of the river and dictates several critical aspects about THAT flow\u2026the dam BECOMES part of the flow, machines often become critical parts of what makes other flows of social phenomena possible. You can just imagine how complicated and rhizomatic these flows within society get when they have this many moving parts.\n\nThe example Deleuze and Guattari give is of a particular kind of wasp that plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of orchids. So the process of an orchid fertilizing and reproducing with other orchids can be thought of in its own right\u2026as a flow between these two orchids. This specific type of wasp, that Deleuze and Guattari write about, carries the pollen from one orchid to another, which in this context makes that wasp an absolutely crucial part of this flow of reproduction. There\u2019s a sense in which this wasp\u2026has become a machine. The wasp doesn\u2019t have a fixed identity\u2026the identity of the wasp in this moment as it\u2019s transporting the pollen is defined by the connections it has IN THIS MOMENT. Whatever goals or connections that wasp had a week ago or what the wasp does immediately AFTER doesn\u2019t really matter in this context. The wasp has become deterritorialized, there is no sense of identity given to that wasp from the outside\u2026Deleuze and Guattari say that for all intents and purposes\u2026that wasp\u2026has become a verb, something IN MOTION. That wasp has BECOME part of that flow of reproduction\u2026which is to say in some capacity\u2026that wasp\u2026cannot be thought of as just a wasp anymore\u2026that wasp has BECOME part of the orchid. The wasp and orchid themselves forming a rhizome, with countless roots connecting them with other root networks around them.\n\nYou can imagine what this means when it comes to our views on society\u2026if we replace the wasp and the orchid\u2019s reproduction\u2026with some OTHER machine and some OTHER flow\u2026say an individual in their car and their impact as a part of that flow of traffic. Say a group of lobbyists and their impact as a part of that flow of commodities like oil within a society. Say a cultural movement and the role it plays in the flow of ideas that dominate thought leaders in media. Just like the wasp becoming the orchid\u2026machines are often engaged in a process of becoming\u2026becoming part of these flows. Maybe the state, as a machine, is becoming what it is in relation to the flow of history. Maybe an individual is becoming what they are in a given moment in relation to flows of advertising on television. To see what\u2019s going on in the world from the broader perspective of machines and flows is potentially revolutionary.\n\nNow, we could talk for an entire series about what exactly changes in a worldview when you see everything in terms of flows\u2026there have been several anthropologists through the end of the 20th century that have dedicated their lives to studying flows and have developed the concept far beyond what Deleuze and Guattari ever did\u2026but the most important takeaway here, I think, when it comes to understanding the work of Deleuze is that by looking at things in terms of flows, you see the world from a crucial vantage point if what you want is a comprehensive picture of the world and how it works and that vantage point is this: the world\u2026is fundamentally a world in motion. Seeing the world as a collection of static identities, objects to be studied and understood\u2026to Deleuze, that certainly gives you one perspective\u2026but it\u2019s FAR from the full story. See if we want to understand social phenomena\u2026we can\u2019t make the same mistake we\u2019ve talked about when it comes to understanding how political change occurs and we can\u2019t make the same mistake philosophers have made for centuries when trying to understand ontology. There is a way of interpreting the world that is missing from our thousands of years of discourse. This is an alternative picture it\u2019s taken four episodes to prepare the vocabulary for. The world we live in\u2026is a world of difference. It is a world that is constantly in motion. A rhizome of different flows, forming networks, connected together in sometimes chaotic ways. Networks of machines and their connections with other machines that themselves create further rhizomes\u2026these machines when actualizing their political realities territorialize and regulate these flows which are themselves always changing\u2026this picture of a massive, ever-changing, enormously complex rhizome is only available to us when we get out of the business of identity and instead adopt the broader Deleuzian perspective of machines, flows and an ontology of immanence. And by the way, here you can see how tempting it would be in the interest of trying to understand the complexity of this rhizome\u2026to try to break it down into a thousand smaller rhizomes\u2026or to try to break each of those down into a hundred different trees of hierarchical systems. Maybe you spend an entire lifetime as a philosopher playing this game of trying to get to the static identities of things and at the end all you have to show for it is the identity of a single hierarchical system of thought. That seems to be the fate of many of the philosophers that have existed throughout history.\n\nBut the concept of identity is nowhere near this simple. We started this arc of the show on poststructuralism by talking about how thinkers wanted to get away from what they saw as naive, enlightenment era ideas about a lot of different topics including identity. Well this is a perfect example of how one poststructuralist named Deleuze tries to move past that\u2026and show how these outdated ways of looking at identity often have real negative effects on people\u2019s lives, not to mention the opportunity cost of thinking in the same rigid ways for hundreds of years. See, the general thinking has always been among philosophers that identity must exist prior to difference. The logic has always been that if you\u2019re talking about two different things, say a table and a chair. Well, if there\u2019s a difference between a table and a chair that MUST mean that they have an identity as a thing before a difference BETWEEN their identities could ever be pointed out. That\u2019s a table. That\u2019s a chair. They\u2019re clearly different. So what this has led to is a long tradition of philosophers trying to get to the bottom of these identities that exist\u2026but Deleuze is going to come along and turn this entire thing on its head\u2026what he\u2019s going to say is that there is no reason we have to assume that identity is prior to difference. There is no ultimate form of a chair sitting up in a world of forms. There is no static identity of \u201cchairs\u201d in the universe, there is no scientific category that really spells out the identity of a chair\u2026what we have thought of as identity, to Deleuze, is not us touching something written into the fabric of the universe. Identity is always derived from difference. To TRULY grasp identity is to understand that fact. No two things are exactly the same, and if we want to stay honest when identifying things, we have to understand that what we\u2019ve traditionally thought of as identity is the contrast between some thing, and all the things it is not. In other words, difference is prior to identity, for Deleuze\u2026not the other way around. Once again, this is fundamentally a world of difference.\n\nWhat Deleuze is also calling into question here is the long standing dichotomy that\u2019s existed in western philosophy of being vs becoming\u2026and the origins of this criticism go all the way back to the work of Nietzsche and Deleuze\u2019s own unique interpretation of one of his most famous ideas: the eternal recurrence. Deleuze thinks, when you read Nietsche correctly, his concept of the eternal recurrance is actually making a very similar point to what Deleuze is saying following the work of Spinoza and Bergson that we talked about earlier in the series. So if you remember, we mentioned the eternal recurrance very briefly back in our episodes on Nietzsche, we sort of referenced the most popular or practically useful side of it. The idea is that you should think of your life\u2026every living situation, every relationship, every job\u2026every single choice that you make you should do so with the policy that the moment you die your life will restart and you will have to live the exact same life, precisely as you did the first time, over and over again for all eternity. Nietzsche describes it here:\n\n\u201cWhat, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \u2018This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more\u2019 \u2026 and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence\u2014even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!\u2019 Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \u2018You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.\u201d\nThe idea is that we often do things that are self destructive or stay in situations that are clearly causing us a lot more pain than the benefit we\u2019re getting from it\u2026and that it\u2019s easy to get complacent and tell ourselves that the suffering is temporary and it\u2019s gonna be over soon, but how different would we look at things if we knew that the complacency was going to cause us to suffer for the rest of time\u2026and that the level of suffering you\u2019re going to endure is ONLY limited by your willingness to take action, right now. This idea from Nietzsche just raises the stakes and puts things in perspective.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only takeaway from Nietzsche and his work on the eternal recurrence. Deleuze thinks that what this idea leads to\u2026is an entirely new perspective and a long tradition throughout the history of philosophy of dividing the world up in terms of being vs becoming. We\u2019ll talk about it first thing next episode which is out for you to listen to, right now. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_96": {"date": "2019-5-23", "text": "Posted on May 23, 2019\nEpisode 129 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #129 on Gilles Deleuze. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo we ended last episode with a passage from Nietzsche and I want to re-read it for anyone that may not be listening to parts four and five back to back\u2026Nietzsche asks us to consider how we might view our lives differently if THIS was the case:\n\n\u201cWhat, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \u2018This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more\u2019 \u2026 and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence\u2014even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!\u2019 Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \u2018You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.\u201d\n\nNow, this passage was the first time Nietzsche ever talked about the eternal return, or eternal recurrence\u2026this was in his book The Gay Science in 1882\u2026and it was just one year later in 1883 that he expands on the concept some more when he releases one of the most revolutionary books in the history of the world: Thus Spoke Zarathustra. But this time, he talks about the eternal recurrence through the voice of a group of animals that are yelling at and taunting Zarathustra. They say:\n\n\u201cBehold, we know what you teach: that all things recur eternally, and we ourselves too; and that we have already existed an eternal number of times, and all things with us. . . .I come again, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent \u2013not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: I come back eternally to this same self same life . . .\u201d\n\nSo already just a year later we see Nietzsche developing the concept into something that isn\u2019t merely some practical way of looking at your life\u2026but in this second passage there starts to be a level of metaphysical baggage that\u2019s being smuggled in\u2026that ALL THINGS recur eternally. The significance of this change is Deleuze\u2019s interpretation of Nietzsche. He believes that Nietzsche is ultimately making a pretty profound statement here about the long tradition in philosophy of being vs becoming. What he means is\u2026you know, many philosophers throughout history\u2026have divided up existence in terms of being and becoming. Traditionally the category of \u201cbeing\u201d has always referred to things within our perception of reality that are constant. Some philosophers say it\u2019s things that are unchanging. Some say things that are ENDURING. Generally speaking \u201cbeing\u201d has always been the things about reality that act as a solid foundation, things that aren\u2019t going to change. Depending on the philosopher, we\u2019ve heard this expressed in a number of different ways on this show: God is being. Nature is being. etc. Now this concept of \u201cbeing\u201d is always contrasted with a concept that philosophers have called \u201cbecoming\u201d\u2026which as you might be able to guess are all the things about existence that are constantly changing, or in flux\u2026or you could say, in reference to this picture of the world Deleuze is painting, the parts of the world traditional philosophy has seen as \u201cin motion\u201d. The thinking has always been that there is something more real, more foundational about being\u2026than becoming. Becoming\u2026is just in motion\u2026it\u2019s always changing\u2026it\u2019s contingent, surface level appearances\u2026you want to get to the bottom of things as a philosopher\u2026understand being. Understand the foundation that everything that is becoming relies upon.\n\nBut Deleuze is going to question this\u2026and he finds inspiration in several passages of Nietzsche\u2019s work on eternal recurrence. Nietzsche says:\n\n\u201cIf the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for it some unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were capable of pausing and becoming fixed, of \u2018being,\u2019 if in the whole course of its becoming it possessed even for a moment this capability of \u2018being,\u2019 then all becoming would long since have come to an end . . .\u201d\n\nWhat Deleuze takes from this reading of Nietzsche is that in the same way he thinks identity is a derivative of difference, not the other way around. The appearance of being, or what we\u2019ve mistaken as constants of the universe, are only possible to categorize as a result of us seeing what is TRULY fundamental\u2026the constant process of becoming. See, to Deleuze, there IS nothing foundational in the classic way philosophers have talked about it\u2026the closest thing you could ever get to it would be the process of the world in motion, that process of becoming, from our episode on ontology: that unfolding of immanence, from our episode on politics: that desire-production and machines seeking connections\u2026ALL OF THESE THINGS\u2026this WORLD IN MOTION\u2026BECOMING is the foundation. Being, identity, any static system of thought\u2026these are just attempts by people to grow roots into the ground and reduce the rootless, complexity of the rhizome to the rooted simplicity of a hierarchical tree.\n\nThe fact is, to Deleuze, that identity is just not this simple of a concept\u2026and thinking about identity this simply only leads to problems when we try to impose these old, enlightenment era ideas on building the world we live in. For example, in professor Todd May\u2019s analysis of Deleuze he gives an example of this by talking about the movement in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s of the urban renewal of cities in the United States. This is a perfect example of us imposing this naive picture of identity onto entire cities of people. The idea was that during the decades following world war two there seemed to be an uptick in the amount of crime, poverty, unemployment and generally anti-social behavior that was going on in big cities around the country. The THINKING was that the reason for this was because cities, and city life were just too chaotic and unpredictable to ever produce a functioning situation. There were too many people, or too many different walks of life, or too much of a variance in income levels\u2026the solution, people thought at the time, would be to get things organized\u2026and so began a multi decade effort to cordon off different areas of the city and designate them as THE AREA where certain activities were going to take place. There was the shopping district where people would go to buy things. The business district where people would go during the work day. The living district where they\u2019d make new, efficient high rise apartment buildings that would be more affordable for lower incomes than when living situations are more spread out.\n\nWe identified all of the different elements of city life, cordoned them off into their own little sections and expected everything to run a lot more smoothly. What really happened was the opposite. Things fell apart. What happened was that now nobody could get anywhere because the flow of traffic was always to one section of town at one particular time\u2026the whole city is trying to going to work in one district\u2026they\u2019re all going to the entertainment district at the same time after work. The high rise, low income apartment buildings just corralled lower income people into one small area even more, which had the opposite of the intended effect: it concentrated and worsened the ghetto. More than that\u2026when it came to the reduction of crime that was expected\u2026it turned out by funneling the vast majority of people into different sections of town at specific times of the day\u2026this just created a HOTBED for crime. For example, when the entire section of town that people LIVE in is empty because everyone\u2019s in the work section of town\u2026how much easier is it to break into a home with confidence? This dividing of the town had the same worsening effect on relations between people of different walks of life. People felt MORE isolated and separated, and it would be far less likely for someone from two different walks of life to run into each other and have a conversation.\n\nProfessor Todd May cites the work of Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities. The problem with city planning of the type that went on in the urban renewal of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s is that cities just don\u2019t work in the same way that suburbs work. Put more in the language of Deleuze and Guattari\u2026city life, is a rhizome, cities themselves, are machines\u2026and when you try to impose rigid identities and static rooted structure onto them you\u2019re left with a lot of unintended consequences like they were in the 60\u2019s. Remember machines don\u2019t HAVE a rigid identity that they\u2019re beholden to\u2026their identity within a given moment is defined by the connections and relationships to difference around them WITHIN that moment. Well isn\u2019t this a much more accurate description of how a city works? See, from the outside looking in\u2026if you were to analyze a city and try to identify all the different parts that make it up\u2026a city might seem to be pretty chaotic\u2026city planners may come along and think they know how a city works and try to impose order onto what seems to be chaos\u2026but the reality, to Deleuze, is that it is NOT chaos. The city is a machine seeking connections\u2026the connections that it makes: a rhizome. The fact is there IS an order to cities and city life that unfolds. The problem for city planners or anyone trying to assign rigid identities to the way the city functions is that there is no template for a city. There is no cookie cutter way that order emerges. The order doesn\u2019t come from the outside\u2026the order emerges or unfolds from the diverse connections made within the city. Think of the similarities to ontology here: substance doesn\u2019t come from something transcendent from the outside, substance is immanently unfolding from within. Think of the similarities to identity vs difference or being vs becoming\u2026notions of identity or order unfold out of difference or the world in motion. When things within a city are not cordoned off from each other, unable to make new connections\u2026when workplaces and residential areas and restaurants and theatres and low income and high income when everything is all mixed together\u2026it turns out cities just function way better that way. There\u2019s less isolation. Machines make connections that are more diverse and thus have a less compartmentalized view of the world. There\u2019s never areas of town that are completely empty where crime can flourish, there\u2019s always eyes on the street, people feel more safe, people feel a sense of community as a member of the city as opposed to just a member of their neighborhood.\n\nTo Deleuze and Guattari: the mistake we\u2019re making is we cannot think of the needs or identity of a city as something that can be pre-planned and executed\u2026the reality is there is NO SUCH THING as \u201cthe identity of a city\u201d because its identity is not static\u2026its identity will always be determined by the connections that make it up in a given moment which no city planner could ever possibly plan for without the help of miss cleo. When you try to impose rigid identities onto a rhizome, you will ALWAYS run into problems.\n\nAnother example Todd May gives when talking about this clear departure from traditional ways of thinking about identity. Picture a guy\u2026that several times a week goes into a music store\u2026and in between looking for whatever it is he wants to buy, being a single man, he comes to realize that he is extremely attracted to the woman working behind the counter. Now, he ALSO notices\u2026that every time he\u2019s IN the music shop when she\u2019s working she\u2019s always playing jazz music that features the trumpet. So this guy decides that what he\u2019s going to do is start playing the trumpet so that she might like him more, he might have something to talk to her about that isn\u2019t painfully forced and awkward, regardless of the reason: he picks up the trumpet.\n\nNow technically\u2026if we wanted to assign an identity to this man after this moment, as he\u2019s practicing the trumpet\u2026he would be a trumpet player. But where exactly did that piece of his identity come from? Was there some sort of latent trumpet player identity hidden inside of him since birth? If two weeks from now both his arms get ripped off by a passing trolley and he quits the trumpet\u2026is there a trumpet player identity lying dormant inside of him that can just never be expressed? Deleuze would say no. The fact that man decided to be a trumpet player in a given succession of moments was entirely contingent on his open-ended identity as a machine seeking connections, and then the connections that he sought to make as that machine. Also, consider the fact that the only thing that\u2019s going to determine whether in five years this guy is still a trumpet player or not is ALSO entirely contingent on the connections he makes. Will he watch a documentary on Winton Marsalis that inspires him to be the greatest trumpet player ever? Will there be a welcoming jazz community in his neighborhood that invites him to come play with them every week. When he goes into the music store and casually brings up how he was playing his trumpet the other day\u2026does the woman behind the counter seem to be more interested in him. The point is: there wasn\u2019t some static pre-planned identity that determined that this guy was a trumpet player, only the connections made when interacting with a world that is constantly becoming, unfolding and in motion\u2026and this SAME dynamic applies when it comes to all other aspects of the identity of a machine\u2026whether that\u2019s a person in a music store, a city being organized and planned out or a movement of thought that becomes the voice of a generation.\n\nSee this is the mistake that so many people make when it comes to trying to understand their own personal identity. So often people run into the trap of just conforming to the identities handed down to them by their parents. Or doing their best impression of some character they like on a TV show. Or if they WERE to do something like pick up the trumpet\u2026 to just completely copy the way trumpet players have always played the trumpet that came before them\u2026just parroting the people that came before you the same notes, the same scales, the same riffs and transitions\u2026what happens when you live your life in the same safe, pre-planned way so many people play music when they pick up an instrument? What happens is: your life becomes a blocked rhizome. The possibility of a random root shooting off and making a new, exciting connection with another network becomes impossible. The possibility of playing new music with your life becomes impossible. You turn yourself into a tree, rooted in one place, restricted to the same riffs and transitions for the rest of your life unable to see new possibilities.\n\nBut this is what so many people do, to Deleuze. They want an identity given to them by some third party, outside of them that tells them how to live\u2026a city planner for their own identity, someone to answer the question for them: what does it mean to be me? This is why it\u2019s so common for people to want answers to these old questions from philosophy that we began this series with. People desperately want an answer to the question: how should one live? How should one act? As though being a human being could ever be marginalized to questions that simple. As though there IS some sort of human nature, some constant of the universe\u2026some essence where if only the right philosopher comes along and identifies it for us\u2026THEN I\u2019ll have the answers. Then we can rest easy knowing that some transcendent body prescribed a way that I \u201cshould\u201d be. The same way the entire history of philosophy has tried to explain ontology in relation to transcendence. The same way psychoanalysis has tried to explain away desire by relating it to something transcendent. The same way people watch the news, read a few books, hyper focus on one little tree sized section of the rhizome and then spend the rest of their life looking at things from their narrow, one dimensional, hierarchical world view making declarations about the way that things are.\n\nSo what should be completely obvious by this point is that when it comes to the question of \u201chow should a person live?\u201d, the kind of question that dominated the ethics of people like Plato and Aristotle\u2026Deleuze, would never even THINK to try to answer a question like that. This is why, knowing what we know now, the question that\u2019s far more relevant to Deleuze is the question \u201cHow MIGHT a person live?\u201d What possibilities exist, what connections can potentially be made?\n\nRemember in the first episode of the series we talked about his answer to the question What is Philosophy? The conclusion being that when you\u2019re engaging in philosophy you\u2019re not looking for the \u201ctruth\u201d or some set of objectives or identities about \u201cthe way that things are\u201d\u2026but instead, you engage in philosophy to hopefully arrive at the interesting, the remarkable, the useful. There are parallels when it comes to approaching life: we shouldn\u2019t engage in living with the expectation that there is some way that we \u201cshould\u201d be living that we\u2019re going to arrive at.\n\nSee because again the world is fundamentally a world in motion. Constantly emerging, or becoming or in flux. But this picture of the world that Deleuze is painting goes far beyond just metaphysics\u2026this entire worldview is in many ways a call to action\u2026a gauntlet being thrown down, challenging anyone who hears it to rip off the shackles of a rigid identity that\u2019s been given to you and to engage in a process of becoming. To allow your identity to emerge immanently, from inside of you rather than accepting it as a gift from someone else. But it goes beyond just you\u2026his work is a call to embrace seeing the entire world in terms of difference rather than identity. Because if the world is fundamentally immanent and in motion and rhizomatic\u2026then to embrace that immanence and motion and the enormous, fractal complexity and interconnectedness of the rhizome is to affirm existence\u2026rather than negate existence and hide behind identities and hierarchical systems of thought.\n\nTo affirm existence is to embrace difference. To seek out different people, different cultures, different ideas, different answers to the question \u201chow might a person live?\u201d\u2026which could include different jobs, different relationships, different lifestyles\u2026to spend your time engaging in different activities, maybe this year it\u2019s the trumpet, maybe next year it\u2019s archery\u2026the point is with ALL of these that you are a single perspective when it comes to making sense of all this. When I say all this I mean the universe\u2026you are one perspective. Nothing more, nothing less. And as tempting as it is to cling to one of those hierarchical tree-like systems of ideas like you\u2019re a koala baby\u2026to Deleuze, the ONLY way to take a step back and see the interconnectedness and complexity of the world around you is to embrace difference and like the world, stay constantly in motion yourself, having new experiences. Doing things. There is always more to be done. You\u2019ve never seen it all, and Deleuze thinks if you\u2019re telling yourself that you have you should examine what it is you\u2019re REALLY saying about yourself.\n\nThat is the call to action. Let\u2019s embrace the world that\u2019s spontaneously unfolding and in motion by ourselves remaining in motion, and part of living our lives that way is going to include being okay with not knowing how things are going to play out. See if you had some transcendent answer to how you SHOULD be living your life\u2026you\u2019d basically know exactly how your life was going to play out. If you had some static identity of exactly who you are, some dormant trumpet player that lives inside of you then it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise at all when you decide to start playing the trumpet one day. But this isn\u2019t reality to Deleuze\u2026when you\u2019re affirming existence you can\u2019t know how your life is going to play out until you\u2019re actually doing it\u2026and you can\u2019t know exactly what kind of person you\u2019re going to be until you\u2019re actually living as a machine and see the connections around you. To truly affirm existence is to seek difference while also understanding that there IS no cookie cutter template of identity to follow and to accept the fact that when it comes down to it: the universe doesn\u2019t owe you anything. There are no guarantees. To affirm life and to truly embrace immanence and a world in motion is to accept that the universe is going to play out the way it\u2019s going to play out and to get attached to any single outcome, good or bad, is to deny the way that reality is unfolding.\n\nNow, Deleuze is not saying that you shouldn\u2019t try\u2026or that you should resign yourself to total acceptance of whatever comes your way\u2026try your hardest, have a plan, stay in motion, but understand and find peace with the fact that you can\u2019t ever really know ahead of time where that motion is going to take you. For this reason Deleuze is a really big fan of looking at life almost as a series of experiments. Because an experiment is always in some way seeking something new, but you can\u2019t ever know the outcome of the experiment until you actually run the experiment. This is a worldview that can start to sound a lot like Nietzsche, and it\u2019s no coincidence that both Nietzsche AND Deleuze talk a lot about this process of living by affirming life, rather than negating life. But maybe if there\u2019s one thing that both of them have in common is that they both despise conformity\u2026and the idea that the person that stays in motion, embraces difference, creates their own values and identity, makes connections, experiments\u2026the idea that THIS is the person that owes the world an explanation rather than the person conforming to the safety of the systems of thought around them\u2026they\u2019ll often spend their entire lives never seeing enough of the rhizome to even ` know how small of a vine they\u2019re conforming to. But regardless\u2026in closing\u2026when it comes to living life, maybe the best advice is from Deleuze and Guattari themselves,\n\n\u201cThis is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new land at all times.\u201d\n\nThank you for listening.

Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo just thinking ahead\u2026I think it\u2019s going to be extremely valuable for us to spend a little bit of time on 20th century political philosophy\u2026and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do right now. See, there\u2019s a lot of conversations in the REALM of 20th century political philosophy that\u2026NOT ONLY are going to be useful for us, and the future of this show\u2026but the 20th century is just FILLED\u2026 with famous political debates that end up being INCREDIBLY fruitful for the societies they were conducted in\u2026these debates in many cases, you could argue\u2026did more for their societies in the 20th century, than ANY OTHER century of political debates\u2026 did for theirs, ever\u2026even though\u2026to philosophers at the BEGINNING of the 20th century\u2026it really didn\u2019t seem like it was going to be that way at first.\n\nSee there\u2019s this conversation going on at the end of the 19th century heading IN to the 20th century\u2026. about whether it\u2019s a good idea to even be TALKING about political philosophy anymore. Where this is coming from\u2026 are the same conversations that eventually give rise to Structuralism. Remember, Structuralism\u2026one of its main tenants is to talk about how the ideas that we\u2019ve come up with over the years\u2026 haven\u2019t been some ongoing progression towards some ultimate Truth as we may have thought in the past\u2026when it comes to your subjectivity\u2026you are not some free acting agent just disinterestedly navigating the universe. That everything that you DO think and CAN POSSIBLY think is ultimately dictated by the narrow historical, cultural and biological parameters that you were born into, the ideas that you have EQUALLY narrow and subject to an arbitrary historical context.\n\nWell the problems people are having at the end of the 19th century with the idea of engaging in political philosophy stem from this\u2026 they were saying, you know, if the essence of political philosophy is to ask questions like what is it to be a citizen, what is the role of government, how should power be delegated and regulated, how do we best live TOGETHER in communities of different types of people\u2026if these are the questions we\u2019re trying to answer\u2026and the ideas you have about the ANSWERS to those questions ultimately are products of the time and culture you were born into\u2026then when it comes to the task of trying to find THE BEST political philosophy out there\u2026when we have these discussions, what are we even talking about? Because if this stuff is true, can\u2019t we never arrive at any sort of satisfying answers to these questions? Well then is political philosophy something we should even be DOING anymore?\n\nNonetheless\u2026even if there WERE these reservations at the time\u2026political philosophy still went on\u2026and if you were to dissect the conversation that was going on at the time, there were three major branches of the conversation going on, we\u2019re going to talk about all three of them\u2026but one of the branches would have been philosophers taking a much closer look at the subject of Democracy\u2026and one of the biggest, if not THE biggest, conversations ABOUT Democracy that\u2019s going on during this time\u2026is between the famous political commentator Walter Lippmann, and the American Pragmatist philosopher John Dewey.\n\nProbably the best place to insert ourselves into their debate, and start to uncover the position that Walter Lippmann held about Democracy\u2026is to talk about an old criticism of Democracy that probably initially stems from Plato\u2019s Republic\u2026the paraphrased version of this question would be something like: \u201cIs the average citizen of a society\u2026the right person to be making the decisions about who should be making the decisions for a society?\u201d Now, the implication there is that they clearly are not, and just to move us along so that we can save some time another way of PUTTING that would be to say\u2026that we all need to be willing to consider\u2026that a fundamental flaw\u2026in the way a Democracy functions\u2026is that any political action carried OUT by that democracy\u2026is ultimately going to heavily rely on public opinion. Which is the name of Walter Lippmann\u2019s famous 1922 critique of Democracy. This critique of Democracy\u2026John Dewey would later say is the GREATEST critique of Democracy that was around at the time\u2026and John Dewey, if you don\u2019t already know, is the POSTER BOY for a person in support of Democracy.\n\nBut more on him later\u2026let\u2019s talk about Walter Lippmann. Lippmann\u2019s main point, when it comes to the first half of his book Public Opinion, is that there are several, fundamental problems with the structure of Democracies that have existed in the past\u2026 that are going to lead to a LOT of serious problems for societies of the future if we don\u2019t all get serious and DO something about them. The place a lot of these problems stem from: Democracy\u2019s reliance on Public Opinion. Lippmann would say that public opinion being the driving force behind political action in a society SOUNDS great in theory, but in practice\u2026things just didn\u2019t work out the way the founders of our modern democracies had in mind. He references the founders of the United States: he talks about how back then, things were different. Back then\u2026not everybody could vote\u2026the people that COULD vote were relatively wealthy landowners that had a vested interest in understanding their local communities because it directly affected their land. The expectations of the founders were that yes, things would change. The country may grow exponentially. The lives of people may change dramatically, but no matter what happened with the country the PRIMARY focus for a citizen politically\u2026would BE these immediate subcommunities that they were the closest to.\n\nThe reason this was a check mark in favor of democracy was that if the scope of the world you\u2019re thinking about politically is limited just to your local community, and likely the place you\u2019ve spent you\u2019re entire life, it\u2019s going to be a lot easier for you to be qualified to make intelligent decisions about the FUTURE of that community.\n\nBut as we know and Walter Lippmann knew in 1922\u2026this just isn\u2019t the way the world has shaken out. The scope of the world we\u2019re expected to have thoughts on politically is global. When you really take a step back\u2026and LOOK, at all of the enormously complex systems you are expected to have intelligent thoughts about as a modern member of a democracy\u2026fields with THOUSANDS of years of work done, fields people dedicate their ENTIRE LIVES to and don\u2019t even come CLOSE to understanding fully\u2026the world is NOT like the subcommunities that the founders thought were going to keep going\u2026the world is as Lippmann says, \u201ctoo big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety, so much variety, so many permutations and combinations. And although we have to act in that environment, we have to reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage it.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s talking about is that as people when we\u2019re face to face with the unbridled complexity and nuance of the political world, that almost as a DEFENSE mechanism we construct a simpler, alternative model of the world that is more managable\u2026he calls these models of the world that we construct of the ACTUAL environment\u2026pseudo-environments.\n\nTo construct one of these pseudo-environments, what we do is we take a look around us\u2026and create a collection\u2026of stereotypes. Not just stereotypes about people or cultures, he\u2019s speaking more broadly than that. Stereotypes about the environment. Stereotypes about medicine. Stereotypes about the government. Whenever we\u2019re prompted to give our intelligent thoughts about a particular subject as a member of a democracy, we look to our pseudo-environment, go into our grab bag of stereotypes and pull one out to do battle with the stereotypes of everyone else. When you combine the pseudo-environments and stereotypes of each and every member of a particular democracy, the sum total of them to Lippmann \u201ccrystallize into what we call public opinion\u201d. To Lippmann in other words, what WE refer to as public opinion and the resource we use to drive our democracies forward, is nothing more than the crystallized version of everyone\u2019s collective pseudo takes on the world based on stereotypes.\n\nBut if that fact wasn\u2019t bad enough\u2026Lippmann would want us to consider where we even GET these narrow pseudo-collections of stereotypes.\n\nSee to Lippman if you\u2019re somebody trying to create one of these pseudo-environments\u2026in other words: if you\u2019re someone interested in having an opinion on the world, or forming a political stance all\u2026what you NECESSARILY HAVE to do in order to do that is hear about events that you don\u2019t experience, have never seen, yesterday you had no idea this thing even EXISTED, this thing is usually happening so far away from you that you couldn\u2019t POSSIBLY understand its proper context, and YOUR JOB\u2026is to form emotional responses to these events.\n\nNot just that\u2026these emotional responses are ALWAYS based on the moral intuitions of the pseudo-environment the person has already created in their head\u2026in other words\u2026the events of the world are ALWAYS filtered through this preset collection of stereotypes the person had that helped them create a vision of the world up until that point!\n\nNow if THAT weren\u2019t bad enough\u2026Lippmann would want to ask where we even GET these events of the world that it\u2019s our job to form emotional responses to? The media!\n\nWe are living in a world where media products are the best tools the average citizen has to create one of these pseudo-environments. Media products created by people with their OWN set of stereotypes they use to chop up the world. Media products delivered through extremely narrow mediums\u2026through the moving images on a TV screen\u2026through the limitations of an existing format of a podcast\u2026through the extremely narrow metric of what it is to \u201creport\u201d on something. Not to mention the profit motive of media outlets which is driven by consumer decisions, not by how accurate the media is\u2026Lippmann has a quote:\n\n\u201cFor a dollar, you may not even get an armful of candy, but for a dollar or less people expect reality/representations of truth to fall into their laps.\u201d\n\nBut if even THIS weren\u2019t bad enough, consider all of the OTHER obstacles in the way of getting to even these MEDIA sources. Consider that the media itself is ALWAYS delivered by the vehicle of language, which is itself an extremely crude and narrow thing. Consider the socio-economic limitations that face the average citizen when constructing this pseudo-environment. For example, most people work 40 hours a week, they have families and lives to maintain, they have recreation time to tend to so they don\u2019t burn out of the whole process\u2026how much time is there really at the end of it all to educate yourself on all of these extremely complex systems so you can be some sort of weekend warrior road scholar?\n\nYou know, the prominent idea for a long time was that access to information was going to be an extremely good thing for political discourse. The more information people had the smarter they were going to be, the smarter they were the more complex their ideas and discussions would become\u2026the one dimensional political fanaticism of the past was a result of the ignorance of the populations. This is why a lot of people were extremely optimistic when the internet first came along\u2026you want to talk access to information\u2026the internet is like throwing gunpowder on that fire. So why does it seem like it has simultaneously thrown gunpowder on one-dimensional political fanaticism?\n\nWalter Lippmann saw this coming. Because he knew that when people seek information they are not seeking truth. They\u2019re seeking to reinforce a pseudo-environment of stereotypes they already believe in, and even if they\u2019re not\u2026the whole process of seeking information is filtered through their EXISTING set of stereotypes\u2026and it sabotages the whole process. Lippmann says so often what we think of as developing our understanding of politics and the world\u2026is really just us choosing between which of the handful of existing authorities and thought leaders we\u2019re going to entrust our worldview to. There\u2019s no question as to why Lippmann would have had a problem with using Public Opinion as a means of directing society.\n\nNow, let\u2019s switch sides of the argument here and talk about the position of the philosopher John Dewey. You know\u2026.there\u2019s that classic way of breaking down the two different ways people see themselves as citizens within a society. They either see themselves as in competition with the other people around them\u2026or they see themselves in cooperation with the other people around them. The idea is\u2026you know\u2026when you go down to the Farmer\u2019s Market and you see the dude getting the avocados\u2026when you look at that guy do you see it like I am an individual\u2026he is an individual\u2026and we are two individuals embarking on two separate journeys within the same society. Or\u2026do you look at the guy and see him as a team member, and the two of you are part of a team in cooperation towards a common goal? One certainly isn\u2019t inherently better than the other\u2026the philosophical question that\u2019s being asked here is do you look at your place in society through the lens of the classical liberal tradition of individualism or the progressive liberal tradition ala John Dewey?\n\nNow this contrast between competition and cooperation is going to be important when it comes to explaining Dewey\u2019s positions on Democracy. See, because John Dewey\u2026would no doubt give credit where credit\u2019s due. He would say Walter Lippmann makes some very strong points about Democracy in Public Opinion\u2026that is IF you are looking at Democracy as a system of government. Looking at Democracy as MERELY\u2026a system of government as Plato did in the Republic.\n\nJohn Dewey tears into Plato. See, it was the ancient greeks\u2026in their pursuit to try to uncover the \u201cbest form of government\u201d in their form of political philosophy\u2026that initially included democracy in their discussion. We had the monarchy government by the one. The aristocracy government by the few. Democracy government by the many. But here\u2019s where the shift happens. John Dewey is going to ask: what if Democracy\u2026is not JUST a form of government? What if what we think of as society is an organism\u2026and government is merely something produced by that organism, like a bird produces a nest?\n\nFirst question first: what if democracy is not just a form of government. John Dewey thinks this shouldn\u2019t really be THAT HARD of an idea to wrap our heads around. I mean, Democracy is something you see across almost ALL LEVELS of society, not JUST in Washington DC he says. Democracy is present in corporations, families, churches, groups of friends tons of other examples\u2026you even see democracy present in the behavior of groups of animals in the animal kingdom. Democracy is CLEARLY not JUST a form of government, so what would be a more accurate way to classify it?\n\nJohn Dewey calls Democracy a lot of different things\u2026he calls it a way of life. He sees it as tantamount to freedom, but probably the most important way that he classifies it if you want to understand his arguments against Walter Lippman is that he says Democracy is an ethical ideal, not just a form of governement. This takes democracy as not just the result of some political discussion about forms of government and reframes it as an ethical imperative.\n\nDemocracy is a tool for social unification that we all have an ethical obligation to maintain, and there\u2019s a lot of reasons why. First, John Dewey sees a fundamental problem when it comes to looking at society through the lens of individualism. Very short excerpt from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that uses multiple John Dewey quotes just to illustrate what he means here:\n\n\u201cmen are not isolated non-social atoms, but are men only when in intrinsic relations\u201d to one another, and the state in turn only represents them \u201cso far as they have become organically related to one another, or are possessed of unity of purpose and interest\u201d\n\nThis is why democracy is such an effective and STABLE form of social unification for Dewey. Society is an organism, and the individual and society are what he refers to as \u201corganically\u201d connected to each other. So in this sense: within a TRUE democracy\u2026 the individuals are always able to CONTRIBUTE to and own part of the society, because they\u2019re participating in it\u2026 and the society is always able to CONTRIBUTE to and own part of the individuals because they are always a person ENGAGED in the issues OF that society.\n\nThis is a major shift of perspective: instead of looking at this as a society with a government keeping it in order\u2026Dewey is seeing this more as an \u201cethical community\u201d of citizens, society\u2026an organism comprised of them\u2026that none of us would ever have been able to survive or flourish except through our participation within this organism\u2026this is part of the reason why, to Dewey, it is much more accurate to view others around you as team members in cooperation than to view yourself as an individual doing their own thing. In other words: yes, democracy is a form of government, but the only reason its a form of government is because it is also a deeper form of social unification. And not only is Democracy the most stable form of government because of this symbiotic relationship between the two organisms of the individual and society, but it\u2019s also the most stable because its the best at safeguarding against potential authoritarian systems taking control of the organism. He says in a famous passage:\n\n\u201c\u2026every authoritarian scheme, \u2026 assumes that its value may be assessed by some prior principle, if not of family and birth or race and color or possession of material wealth, then by the position and rank the person occupies in the existing social scheme. The democratic faith in equality is the faith that each individual shall have the chance and opportunity to contribute whatever he is capable of contributing, and that the value of his contribution be decided by its place and function in the organized total of similar contributions: \u2013 not on the basis of prior status of any kind whatever.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is that if you look at every brand of authoritarianism that ever rears its head\u2026one similarity you will always find is that it tries to use some birthright, some aspect of \u201cnature\u201d, to justify it\u2019s power. Remember that these authoritarian regimes try to use \u201cthe natural order of things\u201d because it\u2019s going to come up later, but think about it: the divine right of kings, being a ruler because you\u2019re part of the right bloodline, ruling over others because they\u2019re the wrong race, even down to ruling over others simply because people that came before you were high ranking in the social structure of THEIR time\u2026Dewey is saying that authoritarian regimes all use this same trick. They justify their ability to rule based on some prior principle as he says. But Dewey is going to say this is yet another strength of democracy as a method of social unification, because it\u2019s the ONLY system where prior status doesn\u2019t really matter. Every person has the ability to contribute something to society if they have something valuable to say. To John Dewey, each and every person is unique and thus brings a unique perspective to the problems society is facing. Don\u2019t we want as many good ideas as we can possibly get as a society? Then why would we EVER limit ourselves to a panel of oligarchs or a single dictator? This is part of the reason why John Dewey is such a huge advocate of education and its reform. When you consider that our society hinges on the ideas of the citizens that make it up\u2026why WOULDN\u2019T we do as much as we can to ensure that people are not only as educated as possible, but also are taught HOW to think and adapt with changing environments. True democracy SHOULDN\u2019T just be a form of government\u2026it shouldn\u2019t be DEFINED by just a bunch of people voting for what they want\u2026Democracy is MORE than that to John Dewey\u2026see a TRUE democracy should allow every citizen within it to realize their full potential, the good news being that allowing people to realize their potential helps society immensely as well.\n\nYes, certain people are going to go down rabbit holes of information and become enraged political zealots, but that shouldn\u2019t discourage us when it comes to democracy, to John Dewey, it should cause us to re-up on our commitment to education and teaching the citizens the skills to be able to not fall into those traps of simplified thinking. Remember, society is an organism and government is part of what that organism produces, like bees produce a hive. THIS is the much more accurate way of looking at society\u2026which is why he takes extreme issue with many earlier political philosophers that approach questions of government from the perspective of a \u201csocial contract\u201d that is automatically signed at birth somehow. First of all, the idea that you\u2019re just born into a society and you are automatically enrolled in some subscription TO that society is just wrong to John Dewey. This is nothing more than yet another example of philosophers trying to use \u201cthe natural order of things\u201d or \u201chuman nature\u201d as a means of pretending they know a lot more about the way societies work than they actually do. The world is no where near that simple, in his view. And as we continue on talking about 20th century political philosophy this dichotomy between nature and culture is going to become more and more relevant. Whether you attribute to the behavior of human beings some aspect of their \u201cnature\u201d or whether you think cultural influence has much more of an effect on political matters will ultimately dictate a lot of things about which side of the political spectrum you fall on. For example, do you think that climate change is a byproduct of NATURAL processes that we have very little control over, or do you think it is highly influenced by humans and that we should do something about it. Do you think that gun violence is the byproduct of a certain NATURAL percentage of people that are mentally ill, or do you think something about the way we structure our societies is causing gun violence. There are TONS of examples of this that you could point to and in many ways these disagreements come down to this distinction between nature and culture that flourished during the 20th century. Look forward to exploring it further with you\u2026thank you for listening\u2026i\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_98": {"date": "2019-5-23", "text": "Posted on May 23, 2019\nEpisode 131 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #131 on Antonio Gramsci.

Nice enough person comes up to you\u2026starts talking to you\u2026let\u2019s say the conversation starts to go in the direction of politics\u2026you talk for a while\u2026some point in the conversation you decide to ask this person, so\u2026 what are YOUR particular feelings about politics\u2026where do you land on the whole political spectrum\u2026magine the person replies with\u2026well, I\u2019m a Communist! Communism is the solution\u2026to all of our political problems. Now, to us, being people living in the 21st century that have seen history play out the way that it has, no matter WHAT you think about Communism, we would INSTANTLY have a lot of thoughts about this person and probably a few questions that we wanted to ask them. See because the word Communism carries with it an enormous amount of baggage to us in the 21st century\u2026baggage, it\u2019s important to note, that just didn\u2019t exist when people were having political discussions at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThat\u2019s what I want us to consider here at the beginning of this episode. Just how much has changed, just how much has transpired since philosophers were having political discussions at the beginning of the 20th century. What I want to do is try to take a step outside of our 21st century biases and try to do our best to put ourselves in the shoes of someone viewing the political landscape back when Communism was first being proposed as a potential solution. See because when you do that you can start to see the political philosophy of the time within its proper context\u2026you can start to see\u2026how in many ways the goals of the reformed democracy that we talked about last time and the goals of the Communism that was being proposed back then were actually incredibly similar. Remember at this point in the timeline of discussion about political philosophy, there were three major conversations that were going on that were all trying to solve the same general problems that existed in the political philosophy of the time. One was democracy, one was Communism and the general problem they were both trying to solve was: how do we ensure that in the future society doesn\u2019t devolve into a situation where a relative handful of people have an inordinate amount of control over the lives of the majority of the population. This had been a serious problem in the past. Democracies of the past had produced this situation time and time again, which was why there was a discussion about a reformation of democracy that would preserve the true essence of a democracy which was a government by the many, not a handful of people. Well Communism was very similar in terms of what it was aiming to do.\n\nLike we talked about when we did the series on the Frankfurt School, for neo-Marxist thinkers at the beginning of the 20th century there was a short period of confusion when it came to what exactly was going on. See, Marx prophesized that very soon the proletariat would realize that all they had to lose were their chains and that inevitably, they would rise up, they would overthrow the bougousie and implement a new system of economic order, let anyone who agrees with Marx cross their fingers and hope that it ends up being Communism. But this Communist revolution just wasn\u2019t happening in almost every case. So what was going on? Neo-Marxist thinkers went back to the drawing board: why does it make ANY sense that people living in these abject conditions, working jobs that were in many cases COMPLETELY brutal\u2026why would those people stand for it? Why didn\u2019t Marx\u2019s prophesy come true?\n\nWell, very quickly the trend that emerged in neo-Marxist thought of the time was that control over a population of people extends far beyond the halls of congress or the ballot box. Political control is almost always dictated by cultural control. This is why the italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci spends a considerable amount of his work exploring the concept of political control and more specifically the very important question of: when there is a dominant social group or a dominant class within a society\u2026how exactly does that group ascend to power and then beyond that\u2026how do they MAINTAIN that power once they\u2019ve gotten it\u2026especially when the social order that they promote WITH that position of power often times is at odds with the wellbeing of the average person? The fact is that sometimes when a leader is elected\u2026they don\u2019t try to pass policy that\u2019s necessarily good for the majority of the population\u2026sometimes they support policy that really only benefits them or friends of theirs that are members of a dominant social class. Gramsci wants to find out: why is it that these leaders are sometimes capable of getting massive support from the people for policies that are actually hurting the average citizen more than helping them. How is it possible that the proletariat can feel so comfortable participating in a system that keeps them in chains, in the eyes of a neo-Marxist thinker.\n\nGramsci begins his explanation by evoking and repurposing a word that had been thrown around all throughout human history but it was a word that he thought in recent years was starting to take on an entirely new meaning. The thing that was responsible for allowing a particular social class to ascend to power and then maintain a privileged status\u2026was what he called Cultural Hegemony. This concept of hegemony is going to become massively important to the political conversation of the 20th and 21st centuries and by the end of this arc of the show we\u2019re going to have looked at it from a lot of different perspectives. Maybe we should start from the origins of the word\u2026the word hegemony originates in ancient Greece\u2026the root of the word comes from the greek word meaning \u201cto lead\u201d, some translators say it\u2019s closer to \u201cto rule over\u201d\u2026but either way during antiquity there were things called hegemons\u2026now in the context of ancient Greece a hegemon was typically a state that had a significant military advantage over another state\u2026the arrangement being that if the weaker state didn\u2019t comply with certain demands from the hegemon they would be annexed or dominated militarily or burned to the ground, take your pick. The term hegemony implied the threat of physical dominance over a population of people\u2026this was the case all throughout human history.\n\nBut Gramsci is going to say that in our modern world the definition of the word hegemony needs to evolve with the political reality we are living in. We are no longer living in a world where most political control is exercised by military dominance over a population of people. Since the advent of mass media people in positions of power have realized that a much more effective way of controlling populations is by manipulating the cultural parameters that citizens have to navigate. The general idea is this: to be a human being living a life in our modern world\u2026you always HAVE to be living that life immersed within a particular culture. But what IS a culture other than an elaborate collection of norms, rules, structures, mores, taboos, rituals, values, symbolic gestures\u2026these things are not exactly abstract concepts\u2026they are acute. They are visible. This is the cultural custom of a handshake to pay deference to someone else. This is not talking with your mouth full. This is the sum total of every ritual we engage in on a daily basis that all come together to create a cohesive society. But what Gramsci is going to ask is: who exactly created all of these norms and taboos that we abide by?\n\nWe can easily look at different cultures around the world and all throughout history and see that a culture can function and flourish when doing things completely differently. The norms and taboos of a culture can be completely alien from the modern world that we\u2019re living in, and yet things still somehow managed to stay held together\u2026so it makes Gramsci wonder: to what extent is the current set of norms and taboos serving to reinforce itself? To what extent are the citizens seeing the current set of norms and taboos not as an instantiation of culture, but as\u2026just the way the world is?\n\nOnce again this is another example of this classic debate that is going to become increasingly relevant: how much of the reality of the world can be explained by nature, how much of the world can be explained by culture?\n\nThis is extremely important because to Gramsci if you can control the narrative and you can convince the average citizen that the current set of cultural norms is just the way the world is then there\u2019s not going to be much complaining, there\u2019s not going to be much in the way of seeking justice and trying to change things\u2026this is similar to a point we discussed from Simone De Beauvoir and The Ethics of Ambiguity\u2026we don\u2019t get mad at hurricanes. When a hurricane comes along and devastates multiple cities\u2026people die, homes are destroyed, billions of dollars in damages\u2026thousands of families displaced every one of those cases a tragedy in its own right\u2026but as human beings what do we do? We accept it. Why? Because there\u2019s no sense in getting mad at a hurricane. There\u2019s no human intent or will behind a giant storm, nobody can be held morally culpable, so we chalk it up as an unfortunate series of events. Hurricanes are part of nature. There was nothing we could really do to stop it. Sometimes the world\u2019s at large and I just have to deal with that the best way I can and accept it.\n\nTo Gramsci, this is the old switcheroo that\u2019s going on with cultural hegemony. Dominant social classes have the ability to dictate cultural norms, these cultural norms often times serve to reinforce themselves and people born into these cultures often times view the normalized state of the world around them as nature rather than culture\u2026Gramsci thinks this is a cultural story that is being told\u2026so often citizens see it as just the way the world is and something they need to just accept.\n\nTo Gramsci, this is why Marx\u2019s prophesy hasn\u2019t come true. This is why the proletariat continues to live in chains\u2026because they\u2019ve come to accept those chains as the natural state of the world that they need to come to terms with. Cultural norms become to the average person what Gramsci calls the \u201ccommon sense\u201d that they use to make sense of their place in the world. When the common sense of your world serves to legitimize the dominance of a particular class of people and tells you that anything you don\u2019t like about your socio-economic situation is just the natural order of things\u2026then your very existence becomes reinforcing of cultural hegemony\u2026you are reinforcing the political status quo simply by participating in the culture that you were born into. This is why people that would otherwise never stand for getting pushed around can find themselves getting worked into the ground in a factory during the time of Gramsci only to accept their place in the world as a necessary part of how the world works. Parts of my life may be hard\u2026but you know what\u2026that\u2019s life.\n\nBut look it\u2019s not like Gramsci\u2019s saying that life should never be hard. The more accurate question is probably: how hard does life NEED to be and how many hard aspects of life have been made into a normalized part of our modern world that we just accept that disproportionately serve to benefit a dominant group within society?\n\nBeing a neo-Marxist you can no doubt guess what his first and most commonly used target is throughout his work: Capitalism. So to Gramsci even people that are struggling within a Capitalist system have often times lived their entire lives immersed in a culture that promotes the merits of Capitalism\u2026this, in turn, creates a sort of economic Stockholm Syndrome, where despite the fact they are struggling, the citizens identify themselves and their place in the world in relation to Capitalist ideology. When the entire way that you view the world has been given to you by a culture that benefits from maintaining capitalism, Gramsci would say don\u2019t be surprised if that education produces a few blind spots.\n\nThese blind spots are the point. Cultural Hegemony in many ways is accomplished by getting consent from the population to keep things the way that they are by making sure people are blind to other options at their disposal. Keep in mind as we continue talking about cultural hegemony that this isn\u2019t always accomplished by an organized group of people that are actively trying to control things. Cultural Hegemony can exist and people can be a part of perpetuating the status quo just simply by acting out of their own self interest, see because their self interest is always considered in relation to how the CURRENT system can help them\u2026they unintentionally support things staying the same.\n\nWhat Gramsci is getting at is that for any single person or any social institution\u2026 to appeal to groups in positions of power for the sake of your own self interest you must\u2026in some capacity\u2026go along with the way things are currently structured. So for example if you\u2019re an aspiring politician or social commentator that wants to make the world a better place\u2026the only way you are EVER going to be able to get your message across is by participating in the existing culture and using the tools at your disposal. This is an ideal situation for cultural hegemony and one of the goals of its final stages: to make the values of a particular culture seem so a part of nature and so in line with \u201ccommon sense\u201d\u2026that the members of that culture don\u2019t even question them. To get people completely entrenched in this world where they mistake the reality of their culture for the reality of the universe. To think the reason things are staying the way that they are is because people are weighing all the options at their disposal and making the best choice, not complying with the demands of a cultural hegemon.\n\nJust like the militaristic hegemon of ancient Greece\u2026the goal of cultural hegemoney is to stay in power. Now over time dominant groups realized that the most efficient way of doing this is by controlling people\u2019s systems of values. Gramsci thinks by and large people acquire their systems of values by listening to and studying voices within a culture that to him are massively important: public intellectuals. Gramsci makes an important distinction here between two very different types of public intellectuals. There are ruling intellectuals and organic intellectuals. Now, the ruling intellectuals are going to be the sort of foot soldiers for the dominant set of cultural norms that are currently in place\u2026these are the people whose commentary on the world is going to reinforce the status quo. Keep in mind that this in no way is saying that these are BAD people necessarily\u2026most of them may not even realize that they\u2019re doing it. But Gramsci wants to shine a light on the insular, often times self-reinforcing world that many of these intellectuals come from. So often it\u2019s from academia. So often these people are completely out of touch when it comes to what life is even like for most people in a culture.\n\nThink about the common archetype of a philosopher throughout history. Philosopher decides they\u2019re going to resign themselves from public life, lock themselves away in a tower and think about stuff really, really hard\u2026THAT\u2019S the path to creating better philosophy\u2026the last thing you\u2019d EVER want to do is have the basic thoughts of a normal everyday person corrupting your genius. Gramsci thinks this is completely ridiculous. Not only is this elitist\u2026and making tons of value judgments about how certain human experiences of the world are inherently better and can even be corrupted by other people\u2019s experiences of the world\u2026but aside from all of that\u2026Gramsci thinks this approach actually prevents you from ever being able to participate in discussions about politics at all\u2026because political discussions BEGIN from the starting point of self-awareness and self-reflection while considering how that self relates to all the other people around you\u2026and how could anybody locking themselves away in a closet thinking about stuff ever hope to contribute to that conversation?\n\nBut nonetheless these ruling intellectuals often times dominate the ideas that are available to citizens of a society. So often these intellectuals are the ones that write the articles, they\u2019re the ones published in journals, they conduct the studies, they write the textbooks\u2026so often these intellectuals control the education of the next generation of citizens when so much of their prominence as an intellectual was only given to them simply because their ideas corresponded with the existing social order.\n\nHere\u2019s what Gramsci is saying: cultural hegemony is established by taking control of three things. The intellectuals of a society, the education within a society and the philosophy that drives people to political action. So in other words if you\u2019re someone that came up through the education system of an advanced capitalist society\u2026Gramsci would say don\u2019t be surprised if there are some pretty glaring holes in your understanding of Capitalism\u2026because just statistically\u2026most pieces of information you\u2019ve ever had access to have been written by people that reached that level of social influence by participating in a Capitalist system that benefits them. Your high school or university wasn\u2019t taught by unbiased monks.\n\nThat most likely, once again just statistically, you have come up in a world where you are far more likely to hear about the merits of Capitalism and all the good that it is doing for people in the world. When conversations about the downsides of Capitalism come up you are far more likely to hear them glossed over by other people\u2026you\u2019re less likely to have someone call you out for glossing over them, and the conversation is likely to go in the direction of how the good of Capitalism drastically outweighs the bad. When you hear people talking about Socialism\u2026when coming up in an advanced Capitalist culture you\u2019re far more likely to have run into conversations about the horrors of Socialism, how it\u2019s failed everywhere it\u2019s been tried and if anyone brings up something good that Socialism has done it\u2019s written off as a broken clock is right twice a day sort of thing.\n\nNow here\u2019s the really interesting part: this view of economics and how it plays out in the world may be absolutely true. Capitalism could just be BETTER than Socialism. But how would you ever know for sure? Because if you\u2019re an intellectually honest person you\u2019d at least for a second have to consider that maybe your entire understanding of Capitalism and Socialism has been given to you by a handful of intellectuals you\u2019ve entrusted your worldview to\u2026that are intellectuals and gained their credibility simply because their view of the way the world is corresponds with a dominant cultural narrative that keeps the status quo going\u2026whether maintaining the status quo is good for a particular social group that\u2019s pulling the puppet strings or whether it\u2019s good for just keeping society stable\u2026what if you\u2019ve lived your life learning from a lot of really smart people that are all just telling the same side of the story?\n\nNow Gramsci would say this is not just limited to Capitalist societies\u2026that it\u2019s entirely possible to come up in a society that unfairly promotes the merits of socialism and creates the same sort of echochamber of ideas. Gramsci\u2019s goal was not to replace a western world dominated by Capitalist ideology with one dominated by Marxist ideology. His goal was to replace both of these narrow approaches with an ideology where the public has a general and intense level of skepticism about the status quo, no matter WHAT the status quo looks like. The biggest mistake we can make is to see these ideologies as nature or the way that things are. We should ALWAYS be critical of the status quo\u2026the fact he\u2019s so critical of Capitalism is just him following his own advice about the status quo of the world he happened to live in.\n\nTo make a long story short: Gramsci thought that Marx and so many other Marxist thinkers that came after were putting the cart before the horse. They were all so wrapped up in the possibility\u2026the inevitability of a Communist revolution in the west. They were so wrapped up in waiting to see Capitalism destroy itself that they completely missed the fact that different methods of cultural control could fragment a population to the point that a revolution could never take place. Gramsci makes another important distinction in his work to these people that were calling for revolution\u2026that for any meaningful social change to take place, regardless of what it is, there needs to be two wars that are fought and won: first a war of position\u2026then a war of manuevre. These orthodox Marxists of his time were far too focused on the war of maneuvre\u2026which was the actual Communist revolution that they wanted to bring about. But Gramsci says before that can ever happen you need to defeat the cultural hegemon in a war of position. Remember a cultural hegemon will have control over the intellectuals, the education and the philosophy of a society. The goal of anyone trying to bring about any kind of social change should be to provide alternatives in all three of these areas\u2026they should create a counterculture\u2026an alternative set of cultural norms and taboos reinforced by intellectuals whose job it is to actively CHALLENGE the status quo. He called this other type of intellectuals \u201corganic\u201d intellectuals and it was their job to be skeptical of the existing order of things\u2026provide an alternative means of education that took cues from the counterculture that was created and to embolden the average citizen to take political action by giving them a philosophical outlook that changes the way they see themselves and how they fit into the world. This is why so many attempts at revolution have failed in the past to Gramsci\u2026the orthodox Marxists that tried to organize it didn\u2019t understand the \u201ccommon sense\u201d of the workers that needed to carry out the revolution. These workers saw themselves and their place in the world solely in terms of how they relate to Capitalist ideology\u2026the ONLY WAY to shift their perspective enough to see the other side would be to fundamentally change the way they look at the world philosophically.\n\nSee an extremely important term in the work of Karl Marx that was used to describe the way he saw things was \u201chistorical materialism\u201d. Gramsci was a neo-Marxist. When it came to these orthodox Marxists we\u2019re talking about\u2026he distanced himself considerably from them and a big reason why was because he thought they were paying way too much attention to the \u201cmaterialism\u201d part of \u201chistorical materialism\u201d and not enough attention to the historical part of it. Gramsci may have supported Communism and Communism may have played out in a particular way throughout the 20th century\u2026but Gramsci hated Stalin. He would have hated Mao. He would\u2019ve hated Pol Pot\u2026he saw people like these as opportunistic dictators that took what would otherwise have been a revolutionary political philosophy and they used it to create dictatorships where the population was forced to deify and worship the state\u2026when to Gramsci a much more accurate reading of the work of Marx would produce the true essence of his work: the spirit of revolution among common people united under the desire to never again allow a handful of people to dominate and control the population. To those living at the time of Gramsci\u2026Communism and Democracy seemed to be two extremely different approaches to trying to solve the same general problem.\n\nSee as we already know from earlier episodes the feeling around this time in the world of philosophy is an intense skepticism towards reason. The Enlightenment gave us hope that science was the answer. Science when given enough time to develop was capable of giving us answers to problems that throughout history have seemed completely unsolvable. When applied to the realm of political philosophy for over a hundred years it seemed totally plausible that something like science\u2026something as unbiased and without an agenda as science could eventually study the way that people are and the way that people work together in a society and it didn\u2019t seem crazy to think that science could eventually give us answers to some of these questions in political philosophy that seemed so difficult to answer.\n\nBut along came Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosophizing with a hammer. Because at the end of the 19th century he asks the question: what if the very act of conducting science at all carries with it cultural values that narrow and distort its findings? We know there are many different ways of conducting science depending on the specific field you are in\u2026we know that scientific revolutions have occurred where there have been wholesale transformations of the methods and assumptions that science is conducted through. What if these limitations and the unavoidable narrow scope that categorizing the universe must be viewed through is missing out on something crucial about what it is to be a human being? What if science, useful as it is, was never the savior that everyone thought it was?\n\nMore on next episode. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_99": {"date": "2019-7-1", "text": "Posted on July 1, 2019\nEpisode 132 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #132 on Carl Schmitt. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo we\u2019re three episodes into this new arc of the show and as you know we\u2019re talking about the early 20th century here. Once again it\u2019s important to keep in mind what is going on during this time. Political philosophy is going through a serious transition phase\u2026the WORLD is going through a serious transition phase\u2026revolutions are taking place, world wars are on the horizon, the rise of fascism, authoritarianism, the entire legacy of the Enlightenment is being called into question\u2026and what this means for the world of philosophy is that the thinkers doing their work during this time are very quickly coming face to face with the realization\u2026 that in this post-nuclear world\u2026 where for the first time the consequences of war could threaten the entire existence of the human race\u2026THEY are the people\u2026 that are going to have to figure this all out. Think of the pressure these thinkers were faced with at the time\u2026To be a thinker born in the early 20th century is to be born into a world\u2026where the strength of your ideas is going to be tested in real time while the fate of the world hangs in the balance\u2026being born into this time period is like the forces of history commandeering you for one of the most stressful jobs in the history of the world. Imagine your first day at a new job and the orientation is: here\u2019s the entire history of western civilization\u2026and day one at the new job is: time for you to fix it all\u2026get to work.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow this job would be difficult enough if we were looking back at a history of total chaos in the west\u2026but keep in mind the western world at this time is the self-proclaimed center of political thought\u2026the self-proclaimed most advanced collection of societies that have ever existed in history. So if this really is such an advanced, developed environment that the rest of the world should draw inspiration from\u2026why do we have such a rich history of things failing miserably? Think of the history this world is emerging out of:\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe age of reason and the political thought of the enlightenment produced for us what we\u2019ve long considered to be the greatest political strategy in existence: Liberal Capitalist Democracy. By this time for over a hundred years Liberal Capitalist Democracy has been the gold standard in the west when it comes to how we should be structuring our societies. The problem facing political philosophers at the beginning of the twentieth century is this: what exactly is it about our long-standing strategy of Liberal Capitalist Democracy that seems to invariably lead society into an endgame of dictatorship, bloodshed and political instability.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen John Dewey and Antonio Gramsci show up with their lunchbox the first day at the new job\u2026this is the first order of business that people like them are going to have to deal with. Now, it\u2019s right here that we can understand why the two of them went in the respective directions they did\u2026because like we talked about the beginning of the 20th century can be broadly understood in terms of three major branches of political discussion,\u00a0three primary conversations\u2026that are going on\u2026we\u2019ve already talked about two of them and understanding all three of them is absolutely crucial because the contents OF these conversations is going to go on to dictate the direction of almost all subsequent political philosophy all the way up to the present day\u2026when a philosopher sets out to contribute something to the political discussion of the 20th century they are almost without exception doing so in consideration to one of these three major critiques of the way we\u2019ve done things in the past. Once again, what we\u2019ve done in the past is Liberal Capitalist Democracy\u2026the three major critiques are going to be John Dewey and his critique of traditional Democracy\u2026Antonio Gramsci and his critique of Capitalism\u2026and the guy we\u2019re going to be talking about today\u2026the philosopher Carl Schmitt and his critique of Liberalism.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut where\u2019s the best place to begin explaining one of the most scathing critiques of Liberalism in existence\u2026maybe the best thing to preface this with just given the demographics of this show is that when Carl Schmitt sets out to critique the doctrine of Liberalism\u2026he is not setting out to critique Liberalism in the context that some living in the modern United States may think of Liberalism\u2026that it is one end of a political spectrum diametrically opposed to conservatism with these two poles being defined by the current state of the US political landscape. That\u2019s not the Liberalism he\u2019s talking about here\u2026Carl Schmitt is not setting out in his work to critique some modern political cliche\u2026some pro-choice Greenpeace platinum member who rollerblades to work and thinks healthcare should be a human right.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what the word Liberalism is actually referring to in the context of this broader philosophical discussion. The term Liberalism is referring to a political philosophy and method of determining political legitimacy that emerged out of the beginning of the Enlightenment. Modern historians when looking back at history often describe Liberalism as the dominant political strategy of the Enlightenment era that should be contrasted with the methods of determining political legitimacy before the Enlightenment\u2013 which historians sometimes just group altogether and refer to as \u201cpre-Liberal thought\u201d. So we have the Liberalism of the Enlightenment\u2026that is to be contrasted with the pre-liberal thought which is the way we did things before the Enlightenment. To put all this in a very Philosophize This way\u2026look, people form into societies\u2026those societies have problems that need to get solved\u2026the people that make up those societies have to figure out the answer to several basic but very important questions: what kind of society do we want to produce? what sort values do we want to uphold when engaging in our political process? what makes something a legitimate political problem at all? how do we solve these problems? specifically what is having a political disagreement even going to look like in our society\u2026because that\u2019s a very important distinction that might not immediately seem like something our political process defines the parameters of\u2026but keep in mind political disagreements of today look nothing like the political disagreements of a thousand years ago\u2026and this is a big reason why Liberalism is often contrasted with pre-Liberalism. Before Liberalism burst onto the scene societies determined levels of political legitimacy with very different methods than we do today. Pre-liberal societies often informed their political process through things like divine revelation, tradition, ritual, pure authoritarianism, theological scholarship, the interpretation of scripture was an important part of the process\u2026pre-liberal societies relied on these methods and these methods reliably produced a certain type of society\u2026people got fed up with this type of society and put their heads together in the Enlightenment to try to come up with better criteria to base our political decisions on. These criteria and the positions they naturally arrive at have come to be known as Liberalism.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow what this transition LOOKS LIKE\u2026in keeping with the theme of the Enlightenment overall\u2026political strategy starts to move away from revelation and instead is beginning to rely a lot more on reason. From pre-liberal to Liberal. When making political decisions\u2026there\u2019s a turn away from pre-liberal methods of theological scholarship and a turn towards a new Liberal focus on secular scholarship. There is a turn away from political decisions based on divine intervention towards a new confidence in decisions that are hashed out through rational debate. The pre-liberal standard of there being some single, anointed authoritarian leader that has ultimate say over the political process is quickly being replaced by parliamentary politics, separation of powers, democracy, civil and human rights, there\u2019s a new focus on issues regarding equality\u2026Capitalism starts to become the dominant economic approach\u2026Liberal Capitalist Democracies as opposed to Feudal Aristocracies. Liberalism primarily aims to do away with the authoritarianism and divine revelation of the past and replace it instead with things like limited government, equality, freedom of expression, secular science and rational debate. Now\u2026somebody born into our modern world that\u2019s largely grounded in Liberal principles might be confused as to how anybody in their right mind could ever possibly disagree with this method of doing things politically. This episode is not talking about the merits of Liberalism but Carl Schmitt\u2019s critique of Liberalism. Might think\u2026look I know we\u2019ve had our problems in the west, but this stuff all just seems like common sense\u2026I mean back to the modern United States\u2026Liberalism seems to be the foundation of BOTH political parties\u2026 how could anybody possibly think that Liberalism is the problem with our long time strategy of Liberal Capitalist Democracy? Carl Schmitt would probably say to this person that the most dangerous political ideology is the ideology that\u2019s currently popular. The kind of ideological assumptions you make about the political process that are so engrained, so steeped in tradition that you don\u2019t even think twice about them. Because if we should regard the thinking before the Enlightenment as pre-liberal and the thinking during the Enlightenment as Liberal\u2026then Carl Schmitt can be regarded as someone trying to bring about a NEW post-Liberal way of thinking politically\u2013 modern anti-liberal is how he\u2019s often described.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo for the sake of understanding where Carl Schmitt is coming from\u2026the important thing to keep in mind here right at the beginning is that when there is this shift towards Liberal principles during the Enlightenment\u2026 what comes along with that is a promise from the thinkers of the time that this new strategy is going to bring about a better world for us. One of the dominant theories among the thinkers of the Enlightenment was that if we let these Liberal values play out and allow them to reach their natural conclusions\u2026we will be the architects of a brand new, cosmopolitan, peaceful world the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo understand Carl Schmitt this is the perspective from which we need to VIEW liberalism. Liberalism was CREATED as an alternative political philosophy that was supposed to be a solution to many of the political problems of the past. These thinkers are looking back at history, seeing the pattern of dictators, bloodshed and political instability\u2026 and they\u2019re trying to come up with a NEW way of conducting politics where these things aren\u2019t going to happen anymore. This is actually a really good way to understand it: You can see why many of the hallmarks of Liberalism are what they are when you think about them in relation to some historical problem they were trying to solve. History of dictatorships and authoritarianism? Let\u2019s introduce separation of powers, checks and balances on the executive branch. History of sprawling empires and rigid national and religious identities? Well, we\u2019re ALL members of a global economy\u2026let\u2019s have political and religious identities take a back seat for now and instead unite the world under the flag of mutually beneficial consumerism.\u00a0History of political and religious wars? Well, let\u2019s not fight on the actual battlefield\u2026let\u2019s instead hash out our political differences in the battlefield of rational debate\u2026where people can still be at odds with each other and go to war\u2026but this way nobody has to die.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis was the hope and ambition of Liberalism as a political philosophy. Liberalism was supposed to be an alternative way of doing stuff that solved these problems of the past but Carl Schmitt is going to say this is no where near what actually happened\u2026try to put yourself in the shoes of Carl Schmitt\u2026try to see Liberalism through the eyes of a philosopher in the early 20th century\u2026similar to the early Liberal thinkers\u2026Carl Schmitt is looking back at history\u2026he too sees the pre-liberal world of dictatorships, bloodshed and political instability\u2026then along comes Liberalism to save the day\u2026and what he sees is really not much changing at all\u2026what he sees is that throughout the entire tenure of Liberalism things continue to descend into dictatorships, bloodshed and political instability all the way up to the present day and he thinks the only reasonable thing to conclude from this state of affairs is that there is a big difference\u2026 between the hopes and ambitions of Liberalism\u2026and how things actually play out in the world. Liberalism, to Carl Schmitt, doesn\u2019t produce the world that it claims to produce.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThroughout several years of his career Carl Schmitt attacked Liberalism from so many different angles that there really isn\u2019t a clear starting point here\u2026so I want to just jump right in to some different examples of hallmarks of Liberal thinking that Carl Schmitt takes issue with, use that as a skeleton and then try to flesh out the rest of his position from there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo just to get us started\u2026one of the biggest delusions of Liberal thought in the eyes of Carl Schmitt is the expectation\u2026 that it is possible for us to produce a society where people can have extreme political differences\u2026and by adhering to the tenants of Liberalism they can co-exist, live peacefully amongst each other and just agree to disagree\u2026put in the words of political philosophy this is the toleration of difference. We see this kind of thinking in western Liberal democracies every second of every day\u2026 You\u2019ll often hear people talk about political discussion with the expectation that this sort of thing is possible\u2026you know we may be totally different people\u2026we may disagree on every element of how a society should be structured\u2026but at the end of the day we can shake hands, live and let live and go on about our lives\u2026Carl Schmitt would say that this is a Liberal fantasy world. That if you pay attention to what is actually going on in the real world of the political\u2026this is not the way extreme political differences interact with each other in our societies. Liberalism just creates the illusion that they do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Carl Schmitt\u2026this expectation\u2026 that we\u2019re going to be able to co-exist tolerant of extreme political differences comes from the more fundamental Liberal belief that there is no political difference so extreme that there can\u2019t be some sort of solution eventually arrived at in an open forum of rational debate\u2026that there is no chasm between worldviews that is so un-bridgable that there can\u2019t be some sort of reasonable compromise that is arrived at by both parties. This is a hallmark of Liberal thought and a cornerstone of the Liberal political process. Now, Carl Schmitt would say\u2026this idea\u2026just in theory\u2026no doubt SOUNDS really great. Who doesn\u2019t want a world where we can always just talk things through politically\u2026who wouldn\u2019t want a world where we never have to implement political policy by force? The problem for Carl Schmitt is that this isn\u2019t how the world works.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLiberalism is marketed to people as an alternative, more peaceful way of engaging in the political\u2026but Carl Schmitt believes all that Liberalism REALLY does is allow people to AVOID engaging in the political. Rational debate puts on a good show\u2026but it\u2019s mostly political theater. There are long periods of normalcy where a bunch of people get dressed up in suits and go to a building downtown and scream at each other about issues that are almost entirely inconsequential\u2026this all provides a nice soap opera to watch that is supposed to be evidence of the Liberal political process in action. Look at how peaceful we\u2019ve all learned to be! Hooray for Liberalism.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Carl Schmitt would say look at history\u2026what happens every single time there is a truly serious political issue where the differences between parties are irreconcilable? What happens when you try to have a rational debate with someone who\u2019s political beliefs are that I should be king of the world and you should all be my slaves? Well, there\u2019s no REASONING with that person\u2026you wouldn\u2019t try to SOLVE that difference of opinion with rational debate. You\u2019d tell that person to sit down and be quiet or else they\u2019ll be thrown in jail. So it\u2019s at least POSSIBLE to have a political situation that all the debating in the world isn\u2019t going to solve\u2026okay, now think of all the political differences that can possibly present themselves that are less of a cartoon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCarl Schmitt would start by saying look, there are going to be groups that emerge in the political landscape whose entire existence is predicated on the destruction of another group.\u00a0The reality of the world is that there ARE political differences that are irreconcilable\u2026and these differences are not all that uncommon\u2026to Carl Schmitt this is one of the failures of Liberal political philosophy\u2026no matter how good it feels to tell ourselves we\u2019re going to be open to outsiders and just talk things out when we disagree\u2026rational debate CAN NOT SOLVE political problems of this magnitude. No matter how much of a poster child you are for Liberalism\u2026faced with political beliefs sufficiently hostile to Liberalism, faced with, for example, an authoritarian regime that wants to ascend to power\u2026you are eventually going to have to do one of two things: choice number one\u2026be willing to accept the destruction of Liberalism simply because something else was popular\u2026choice number two\u2026use the power of the state to silence opposition\u2026or in other words temporarily behave like what we would otherwise call a dictator by using the sovereign authority that to Schmitt is intrinsically embedded into the political process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChoice number two is something Liberals are absolutely terrified of\u2026and for good reason. Remember they\u2019re looking to societies of the past structured around social contract theory. Society is an agreement between the citizenry and the sovereign. The citizen\u2019s job is to serve the sovereign, the sovereign\u2019s job is to ensure the security of the citizen\u2026sometimes in order to do this effectively the sovereign needs to wield an authoritarian level of power. To political philosophers in the days of pre-liberalism\u2026having a designated sovereign body (like a king) that has the ability to maintain certain elements of society unincumbered by the political process was absolutely crucial. During the formation of liberalism people looked back at our history of doing things this way and realized many of the downfalls of great societies occurred when in this volatile place of a sovereign body seizing control. Liberal philosophers tried to do away with the concept of a sovereign\u2026they saw it an outdated and dangerous idea. Carl Schmitt makes the case that this is why once Liberalism comes onto the scene\u2026the thinkers at the time become absolutely obsessed with finding any possible way they can to make it so that we don\u2019t have to have a \u201csovereign\u201d anymore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe idea of a dictatorship, which at the time was historically the most common structure of a successful society, dictatorships become unthinkable. Carl Schmitt wants to mark another distinction between Liberal theory and the reality of the world here. The reality of the world is that societies sometimes need the ability to make swift and decisive decisions and in the post-Enlightenment world this reality gets swept under the rug for the sake of pandering to the Liberal fear of authoritarianism. He thinks this taboo towards dictatorships certainly makes us FEEL good\u2026but it simultaneously ignores capabilities that healthy societies require. To Carl Schmitt this is yet another failure of the Liberal political process\u2026not ONLY does it ignore society\u2019s ocassional need for a sovereign but even if it WANTED to get rid of it altogether\u2026Liberalism doesn\u2019t actually REMOVE the sovereign from the political process\u2026once again it just creates the illusion that there isn\u2019t a sovereign until we actually NEED one. Liberalism performs this illusion by engaging in various different types of what Carl Schmitt refers to as: normativism.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo put it bluntly: Carl Schmitt is saying that Liberalism is terrified of the idea of a sovereign dictator holding power, so to safeguard against that possibility they\u2019ve come up with all these different attempts to hold political power to a set of predefined norms and rules. Liberals are obsessed with this process of normativism\u2026this is the rise of constitutional democracies in the west. Consitutions are designed to be safeguards against the swift and decisive action of authoritarianism. Normativism is sold as an incredible feature of Liberalism that protects the will of the people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, Carl Schmitt uses this term of normativism in a way that is mostly intended to poke fun at the hopes of Liberalism\u2026because like I just alluded to, normitivism is an illusion to Carl Schmitt. The hope and ambition of Liberalism is that by coming up with these norms that political leaders have to follow\u2026whenever somebody comes along that starts to look like one of these sovereign dictators we\u2019ve seen throughout history\u2026we\u2019ll just wave the constitution in their face and they\u2019ll just burst into flames and we\u2019ll never have to hear from them again. But Carl Schmitt is going to say this is yet another delusion of Liberalism that doesn\u2019t shore up with the reality of the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst of all\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter how long you sit down and talk about what the parameters should be for someone holding a position of power\u2026you are NEVER going to be able to come up with a set of rules that accounts for every contingency given how many moving parts are involved when making decisions that affect this many people. To Carl Schmitt trying to normitivize these highly volatile moments is at best drastically oversimplifying how complex the world can be and at worst severely weakening your society and its ability to adapt and defend itself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the good news though: to Carl Schmitt\u2026this isn\u2019t ACTUALLY how things ever play out in Liberal societies anyway\u2026because even the most Liberal society in existence eventually recognizes how necessary temporary extra-constitutional power is given the right circumstances. Carl Schmitt is saying that even in Liberal societies whenever it really comes down to it and they\u2019re faced with some sort of existential crisis the constitution goes out the window anyway. You know, citizens of Liberal Constitutional Democracies often have this expectation of\u2026well the government can\u2019t just go rogue and do whatever they want\u2026they\u2019re held to the constitution, there are checks and balances they gotta to get permission to do something, right?\u2026but what happens whenever there\u2019s an emergency and something needs to get done? Oh, well they just take action. In other words, to Carl Schmitt\u2026Liberalism claims to have gotten rid of the sovereign from the political process\u2026but what happens in these societies whenever something ACTUALLY has to get done and we need a sovereign\u2026abracadabra! Poof! The Sovereign was there the whole time. This is a great magic trick\u2026and to Carl Schmitt the misdirection was performed by the Liberal political process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is another liberal theory vs reality thing to him: the hope of Liberalism was to get rid of the sovereign\u2026the reality of the world is that we have long periods of normalcy where the government does almost nothing\u2026punctuated by rare moments of extreme action whenever things ACTUALLY need to get done. Liberalism hasn\u2019t REMOVED the sovereign and the only time pieces of paper like the constitution prevent the sovereign from acting are during periods of normalcy when the sovereign wouldn\u2019t be exercising authoritarian power anyway\u2026to Carl Schmitt the biggest difference between our modern societies and the ones that existed in the pre-liberal world is that the pre-liberal societies were just a lot more honest about the authoritarianism that was going on. Nowadays we have this grand illusion of Liberalism that puts a bunch of window dressing on it and pretends the world is something that it\u2019s not. Liberalism is in many ways a utopian fantasy in the eyes of Carl Schmitt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is a lot more to talk about and in many ways we\u2019ve just started getting into the main section of the ideas\u2026please if you have the time listen to the next episode while this stuff is still fresh in your brain\u2026it\u2019s released for your listening enjoyment right now. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_100": {"date": "2019-7-1", "text": "Posted on July 1, 2019\nEpisode 133 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #133 on Carl Schmitt. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo for anybody not listening to these two episodes back to back I want to briefly remind everyone of the end of last episode because the discussion on this episode jumps right in immediately where the last episode ended. Real quick, the last episode ended talking about the ambitions of normativism:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cthe hope of Liberalism was to get rid of the sovereign\u2026the reality of the world is that we have long periods of normalcy where the government does almost nothing\u2026punctuated by rare moments of extreme action whenever things ACTUALLY need to get done. Liberalism hasn\u2019t REMOVED the sovereign and the only time pieces of paper like the constitution prevent the sovereign from acting are during periods of normalcy when the sovereign wouldn\u2019t be exercising authoritarian power anyway\u2026to Carl Schmitt the biggest difference between our modern societies and the ones that existed in the pre-liberal world is that the pre-liberal societies were just a lot more honest about the authoritarianism that was going on. Nowadays we have this grand illusion of Liberalism that puts a bunch of window dressing on it and pretends the world is something that it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo maybe the best place to begin our discussion today is just to say that the fact that the sovereign still exists at some level in our Liberal societies shouldn\u2019t come as an enormous surprise to people. I mean, after all what exactly are systems of norms like the constitution trying to normalize? Carl Schmitt would ask if the constitution is a regulatory document\u2026what exactly is it regulating? He would say that what it is regulating is the more fundamental, underlying political process that has been going on since the dawn of civilization. Liberalism\u2019s been tacked on after the fact\u2026makes us feel good\u2026helps us FEEL like the world is a lot more peaceful and tolerant than its ever been\u2026but once again, the reality of the world to Carl Schmitt, the reason we haven\u2019t seen a respite from dictatorships, bloodshed and political instability is because we are still engaged in the exact same political process we\u2019ve always been engaged in\u2026one ROOTED in intolerance\u2026to Carl Schmitt the foundation of the political lies in a distinction between friend and enemy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe friend enemy, self/other, us vs them distinction is probably nothing new to anybody listening to this\u2026and to be fair it wasn\u2019t new during the time of Carl Schmitt\u2026but the level to which Carl Schmitt defends this as the forge in which political identities are cast in makes for an extremely interesting take on what exactly is going on whenever we engage in politics. To Carl Schmitt whenever you are engaging in politics\u2026whether you realize it or not you are necessarily positioning yourself on one side of a duality which from your perspective will always look like your friends vs your enemies. Carl Schmitt famously said show me who your enemies are and I\u2019ll show you who you are.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is actually a reference to Hegel\u2019s views on identity. The idea is that categories of identity can\u2019t exist unless if they have an opposite that they can be contrasted with. So the way this manifests in the political realm is that you only think of your political views and your political identity in terms of how it relates to political views that are the opposite of yours. Your enemies in the friend/enemy distinction. So an example just to illustrate this concept is\u2026you know\u2026nobody listening to this thinks of themselves as a person that is pro-oxygen. I mean why would you. You\u2019d be an absolute weirdo to cordon off your political identity there\u2026I mean who thinks of themselves as a person in favor of people being able to breathe? THAT IS until a group emerges in the political landscape that holds positions that make them ANTI-oxygen. Then and only then does it become a relevant piece of your political identity to think of yourself as a pro-oxygen kind of person. To hold a political position of any type IMPLIES the existence of a group that disagrees with you. To Carl Schmitt to engage in the political at all implies this friend/enemy distinction. The philosopher Leo Strauss summarized his views in a way that Schmitt approved of\u2026he said:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause man is by nature evil, he therefore needs dominion. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against\u2014against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men \u2026 the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you look at politics in this way it makes the Liberal political process start to seem kind of silly\u2026and this is another hallmark of Liberal thinking that Carl Schmitt thinks is a utopian fantasy world. The hope of Liberalism is a world of internationalism, acceptance of the other, toleration of different cultures, shaking hands and agreeing to disagree. Schmitt says no\u2026Liberalism and democracy directly contradict each other\u2026because unless if you are actually somebody that\u2019s calling for the formation of a one world government\u2026you are at some level making a distinction between friend and enemy. Look at your views closely enough\u2026there is some group of people who\u2019s interests, if it came down to it, matter more to you than some other group\u2019s interests. You can\u2019t have a democracy grounded in the idea that the citizens are going to vote along the lines that are best for their society without at some level making a friend/enemy distinction. To Carl Schmitt this is the essence of the political. The political realm is a violent ongoing process of friends banding together and going to war with their enemies capturing territory\u2026whether that war is on a physical battlefield or in the halls of parliament\u2026whether that territory that\u2019s captured is earth and water or control over the state\u2026Liberalism allows for the illusion of multiculturalism and tolerance\u2026when the reality of the world is that we\u2019re only going to be multicultural and tolerant as long as you mostly agree with us. Because when faced with enough difference from Liberal ideas\u2026when faced with the TRUE essence of the political\u2026when it REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT\u2026Liberalism gets thrown out the window as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is why Carl Schmitt thinks Liberalism doesn\u2019t do what it claims to do. Liberalism doesn\u2019t provide an alternative, more peaceful way of engaging in the political process\u2026Liberalism allows people to AVOID the political process altogether and further allows the political to operate covertly behind the scenes while politicians galavant around in the political theater of rational debate without really ever solving anything.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee this is the other side of this that we still need to talk about\u2026because for all the analysis of Liberalism that Carl Schmitt has offered so far\u2026what we really haven\u2019t talked about yet is: why is any of this stuff a bad thing?\u00a0The political process is still going on in spite of Liberalism. I mean, let\u2019s say Liberalism failed at what it set out to do\u2026let\u2019s say it is not an alternative political process but just a bunch of window dressing that makes us feel good\u2026well, it still makes us feel good right? What\u2019s so wrong about that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Carl Schmitt if you were making a list of all the failures of Liberalism\u2026this may be the biggest one of all. Liberalism allows people to feel good about the political process when the world around them may actually be burning to the ground. Liberalism has created a world where more so than at any other point in history people can be completely apathetic about the political reality that they live in. See at many other points in history if there was a political situation going on in the world that was unfavorable for you\u2026 there was at LEAST a sense of obligation you were going to feel for finding some manner of recourse. For Carl Schmitt what Liberalism DOES is give people the ability to disconnect themselves from the political, oh politics? Well that\u2019s something that goes on in that creepy building way on the other side of town\u2026I don\u2019t really get involved in all that. What I\u2019m going to do is just live my life and leave all the debating about politics to the politicians\u2026to Carl Schmitt the grand illusion of Liberalism, that politics is a normitivized, peaceful process of finding ways to compromise with each other\u2026that illusion\u00a0gives people the luxury of being able to not pay attention to or care about politics at all\u2026when in reality this isn\u2019t a luxury at all\u2026and they are just as much at the mercy of the political as they ever have been.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCarl Schmitt would want us to consider just what type of person this level of political apathy creates. He says that for someone that has voluntarily removed themselves from the political process\u2026life in one of our modern societies sort of defaults to a life of being a passive spectator that just consumes stuff. With no political cause to feel a part of\u2026when you\u2019re not part of the process of CREATING the political reality you\u2019re living in your life becomes that of a spectator\u2026watching the world pass you by on TV screens\u2026spending all day watching TV shows, movies and video games of fantasy worlds while you live in a fantasy world of your own\u2026watching the Liberal soap opera of people in suits arguing about mostly insignificant issues buying IN to the story that you\u2019re told that this is all working really well\u2026that you should feel GRATEFUL for your life as a passive spectator\u2026that in the name of Liberal multiculturalism and tolerance you should not feel so connected to a strong political identity, religious identity or national identity\u2026you should think of yourself MORE in terms of\u00a0your identity as a global consumer\u2026the reality of who you are in modern Liberal societies is actually more connected to BUYING stuff than DOING stuff.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Carl Schmitt the promises of Liberalism often ROB people of their political identity. This crisis of identity is in many ways the political equivalent of Nietzsche\u2019s famous claim God is Dead. So as most people listening to this already know when Nietzsche writes those words God is Dead he is referring to an emerging world\u2026 where there is going to be a crisis of identity because people are no longer going to have automatic access to a strong religious identity that they can feel connected to. Now when Nietzsche writes this he is saying it with a bit of an ominous tone\u2026because he realized that when this extremely important piece of people\u2019s identity was no longer going to be in the picture\u2026that void within people that religious identity used to occupy was not just going to disappear. How were people going to respond? Carl Schmitt would want us to consider what it was like to be a citizen of one of these modern Liberal societies in the early 20th century\u2026Liberalism in his view has asked people to give up their political, religious and national identities and replace them instead with the Liberal identity of multicultural globalism. Much like Nietzche, Carl Schmitt would talk about this phenomena with an ominous tone\u2026because he understood how important these types of identity can be to people. Part of living a fulfilling life as a human being is feeling like you\u2019re a part of something\u2026feeling like you have some say in the way the world is unfolding around you. The founders of Liberalism saw that it was often THESE points of identity that led to wars and instability, so in the interest of making a better world they set up a blockade to make it more difficult for people to take these traditional paths to feeling part of something greater than themselves. But Carl Schmitt would say this is a tragic mistake by Liberalism\u2026to deny these aspects of existence is to deny something extremely important about what it even is to be human. Just like in the time of Nietzsche\u2026this crisis of identity is not just going to disappear\u2026people are going to fill it in with something. The question becomes: what will that something be that people can feel like they\u2019re a part of?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNietzsche actually explicitly predicts a massive increase in political and nationalist fanaticism to come onto the scene at the beginning of the 20th century\u2026which was precisely the story that unfolded during the early 20th century. This is in many ways the story of Carl Schmitt. Carl Schmitt was an unapologetic, anti-semitic Nazi who supported fascism. Carl Schmitt believed Fascism could be a prudent and intelligent political strategy given the right circumstances\u2026he felt this way for many different reasons and understanding his rationale for supporting Fascism will be necessary knowledge to have if we want to understand the philosophical underpinnings of people\u2019s political moves all the way up to the present day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee it\u2019s easy to assume that anyone and everyone who could possibly support a fascist approach to political strategy must have been evil beyond all comprehension. But the more inconvenient and unnerving reality is that there are actually reasons Fascism emerged at the time that it did in the western world\u2026there\u2019s a reason why early 20th century political discussions are centered around three primary approaches: democracy, Marxism and Fascism. Why did people living during this time think that Fascism was not only a viable political strategy, but the future of political philosophy?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe answer to this question comes only after understanding Carl Schmitt\u2019s critiques of Liberalism that have been laid out so far. For all of the reasons already expressed and more\u2026the bottom line is Carl Schmitt believes that Liberalism just produces weak societies. Liberal societies lack identity and thus are far weaker than societies that HAVE a strong sense of identity. We can at least understand how Carl Schmitt sees this happening\u2026remember in his view Liberalism incentivizes inaction and complacency\u2026Liberalism produces weak people that generally tend to be more politically uninformed or apathetic simply because they CAN be\u2026Liberalism produces a world where even for the people that WANT to be involved in politics\u2026there cannot be legitimate markers of political communities because within Liberal societies everybody is supposed to be holding hands in a circle singing songs of acceptance with their political opposition.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemember to be engaged in the political for Schmitt is to stand on one side of a friend enemy distinction\u2026well if the whole goal of your society is\u00a0multiculturalism and tolerance\u2026that makes it EXTREMELY difficult if not impossible to really ever make a substantive friend/enemy distinction. Liberalism in this way undermines the formation of political communities and this dynamic when played out over the course of decades and centuries eventually produces societies that to Carl Schmitt\u2026really don\u2019t stand for anything. See historically countries would have something that they STOOD for\u2026the citizens of those countries when faced with something that threatened what they believed in they would defend themselves\u2026they\u2019d be willing to fight and die for the cause. The natural endgame for Liberal societies is a population of people that are faced with a political enemy and are like eh, I disagree\u2026but I\u2019m not ready to go and get on a boat and die for something like this\u2026Game of Thrones season 12 starts next week.\n\nThis is the archetype of what a human being looks like in a modern liberal society. Devoid of any strong religious, political or national identity surrounded by a society that is terrified of the reality of the political process and so as to avoid the political denies the existence of any political identity as it goes around shaking hands with all the other countries telling everyone how super duper tolerant they are hoping nobody sees through that thin veneer to the intolerance just under the surface. This is a weak society in the eyes of Carl Schmitt filled with citizens who cannot be effectively emboldened towards political action because they are so disconnected from what is going on in the world they don\u2019t know who THEY are\u2026they don\u2019t even know who their ENEMIES are.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a sentiment expressed in Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan. When carrying out their end of the bargain in a Social Contract part of the job of the sovereign, part of what makes a state legitimate at all is when the sovereign has the ability to protect the members of the state and their political identities. When a sovereign can no longer do that\u2026the social contract is void. But what if the members of a state don\u2019t HAVE a political identity to protect? What happens\u2026what does the sovereign protect? This is what Carl Schmitt is worried about\u2026Liberalism for its own reasons wants to do away with the sovereign and rob people of their political identity\u2026what does this mean for the future of our modern liberal societies?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell there\u2019s the old cliche\u2026if you don\u2019t stand for something you fall for anything. To Carl Schmitt\u2026these weak Liberal societies that lack a sovereign and lack an identity to protect are essentially just sitting on their hands waiting around for a group that HAS a strong sense of identity to come along and impose THEIR will and identity onto the people with their anemic sense of purpose. This group that HAS a strong sense of identity could accomplish this in a number of different ways\u2026they could insinuate themselves into the Liberal political process, get elected to office and slowly use the tools at their disposal to fundamentally change the country\u2026they could invade militarily\u2026though that\u2019s probably a little old fashioned\u2026think about it: if any group could manage to get elected to a high level of political office\u2026the only thing it would really take is a state of emergency for that group to be able to assume the role of the sovereign in the name of protecting the constitution. Well imagine you\u2019re one of these groups\u2026you want to go full authoritarian on everybody\u2026what if you could just CONVINCE the population that there was an emergency going on? There really doesn\u2019t even need to BE an emergency if you are persuasive enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCarl Schmitt thought that people living in liberal societies are sitting ducks just waiting around for things like this to occur. Carl Schmitt thought an extremely under-developed portion of political philosophy was who gets to decide one of these states of exception and why. Who gets to decide when a leader can make an exception when it comes to the rule of law and the constitution and on what grounds do they make that decision? This is a question that political philosophy has been oddly silent about since the formation of Liberalism\u2026probably because we didn\u2019t even want to entertain the possibility that a dictator would ever be able to transcend these norms and rules we were trying to hold them to\u2026but taboo towards the idea of a dictator or not, Carl Schmitt thinks they are all around us in hiding\u2026some in plain sight\u2026and we should be having a more serious conversation in our modern world about who or what gets to decide the exception.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut anyway the possibility of an authoritarian group co-opting a weakened Liberal society and imposing their will was practically an inevitability to Carl Schmitt. Societies that refuse to acknowledge the essence of the political as friend/enemy distinctions will never know who their friends or their enemies are and are destined to get taken over politically. This is the set of assumptions that serve as a foundation when political philosophers start making a case for Fascism. So if you\u2019re someone that doesn\u2019t care about Liberal values\u2026Fascism starts to seem like it\u2019s that far of a stretch. The idea is that societies ALWAYS have an authoritarian element to them or else they\u2019re too weak to handle real any problems\u2026societies NEED something that they stand for or else they\u2019ll fall for anything\u2026societies that don\u2019t avoid the political process and KNOW who their friends and enemies are don\u2019t waste a bunch of time in gridlock debating the issues. When you reject Liberal principles\u2026Fascism just becomes what a lot of different groups land on\u2026the strategy basically being that the best defense is a good offense. Because if you are the group that is imposing your will on the groups around you\u2026then at least you know you\u2019re not the group that\u2019s getting imposed upon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are a lot of different theories for why Fascism emerged during the time that it did in the early 20th century\u2026but at least when it comes to Carl Schmitt\u2019s brand of support many would say this level of skepticism towards the gospel of Liberalism comes as a reaction to the litany of promises that the enlightenment has failed to make into a reality. Liberalism becomes a mangled form of political theology. Their blind faith in normative parameters like the constitution when these parameters don\u2019t actually remove our need for a sovereign\u2026blind faith in an open forum of rational discussion when in practice major decisions are always made by a handful of people\u2026committees comprised of senior members of political parties\u2026Carl Schmitt would say that when you truly consider the level of variance between the promises of Liberalism and the reality of the political landscape\u2026how can anyone take it seriously when Liberalism promises to produce a more peaceful world for people? When it really comes down to it how is Liberalism any different than most other aggressive, alternative takes on how we should all be doing things?\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne really interesting thing that political philosophers have talked about over the years is the possibility that Liberalism if it were to achieve a level of total global cultural hegemony would eventually eliminate Fascism, remove the need for friend enemy distinctions altogether and make going to war for political or religious reasons an incredibly rare thing, almost non-existent. Then again how would it be different if we forcefully imposed ANY homogenous system of thought? Some would say that the world uniting under the flag of Liberalism, tolerance, multiculturalism\u2026this would usher in an unprecedented era of world peace and economic prosperity. Some would say that is the VERY DEFINITION of Fascism. To say that the path to world peace is we just gotta get everybody to just with me! Then we\u2019ll be fiine!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhether there\u2019s a right or wrong way of looking at a global hegemony of Liberalism, Carl Schmitt would say it really doesn\u2019t matter\u2026because you don\u2019t want to be living in that world anyway. Might seem like a luxury at first to never have to engage in politics\u2026but he would say really play your life out as one of those rootless, ever-consuming spectators\u2026really think about how it would feel to live every day of your life utterly disconnected from the creation of the world you live in and ask yourself if that is really the kind of world that you want to be living in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_101": {"date": "2019-8-7", "text": "Posted on August 7, 2019\nEpisode 134 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #134 on The Consequences of Reason. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo this disagreement that defines the state of the philosophical landscape in the early 20th century: we\u2019ve called it a lot of different things on this show. Nature vs Culture. Modernity vs Postmodernity. Objectivity vs inter-subjectivity\u2026.Well one thing about this debate if it\u2019s not entirely obvious by this point on this show is that understanding the perspectives that are positioned on either side of this debate is absolutely crucial not only for understanding 20th century political philosophy, but even for understanding the world you\u2019re living in today\u2026for understanding the smallest things\u2026the philosophical underpinnings for many of the arguments you might see when you turn on the news.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about bits and pieces of this debate for a long time on this show and it\u2019s high time there\u2019s an episode you can point people to that goes into a bit of detail about this aspect of modern discourse\u2026something that talks about WHY the climate of the early 20th century was filled with philosophers that had such a strong level of dissatisfaction with the legacy of the Enlightenment. That is: rationality, individualism and the scientific method as THE primary way of arriving at truth about things.\n\nBecause this whole state of affairs can start to seem pretty confusing to reasonable people\u2026I mean, how could any serious person ever be anti-science? Look at the understanding of the natural world science has produced. Look at how it\u2019s let us manipulate and wield the otherwise chaos of the natural world to the benefit of human beings. Look at all the different ways every day that you USE the great things science has produced\u2026and what you\u2019re just against that system\u2026you\u2019re dissatisfied with the thing that made those things possible?\n\nLook at all the things rationality has produced\u2026I mean open up a history book. Thousands of years of religious dogma gone\u2026to be anti science and rationality can seem to some like you\u2019re being anti human. Or just pro- some other dogma that you want to impose on people. But an interesting place to get started with this conversation is that the OTHER side of the debate, the ones skeptical of the tasks of the Enlightenment\u2026they would ALSO see themselves as pro-science and anti dogma.\n\nThere\u2019s of course an end to this story we\u2019re telling today about our history of using rationality as our guide, but this is the place I want to begin and the story starts in the late 19th century with the philosopher Nietzsche and some things he had to say about what the attitudes of philosophers were at the founding of the Enlightenment.\n\nSo\u2026some quick historical context: the beginning of the Enlightenment is often cited as the moment when Kant releases his famous essay titled What is Enlightenment? We have an episode on it\u2026Kan\u2019t famously describes Enlightenment as man\u2019s removal of his self incurred tutelage. What he\u2019s referring to is the tutelage of thousands of years of religious dogma. Later on in the essay he CHALLENGES the thinkers of his time to \u201cdare to know\u201d or \u201cdare to think for yourselves\u201d for once\u2026in other words, we need another way OTHER than religious faith to be able to arrive at the truth about things, because faith, from these thinker\u2019s perspectives has caused us a lot of problems historically . Well the thinkers of the time take a look around them, look at all the available options and collectively decide to double down on reason instead of faith. This is the age of reason. This is the use of rational categories to make sense of things, proportioning our belief to the evidence, the political systems of the time take a strong turn towards the individual subject and mutually beneficial social contracts as opposed to teleologies or strict \u201croles\u201d that people are supposed to play in a society.\n\nThis whole strategy seemed extremely reasonable at the time. Ironically later philosophers would lament that that was EXACTLY what was wrong with the strategy\u2026that it seemed reasonable at the time. But we\u2019ll get to that. Nietzsche looks back on this moment in history and sees what the philosophers of the time did as an absolutely giant missed opportunity. Because, he says, hypothetically this was a moment when philosophers could have realized that one of the biggest problems with those faith based views of the world centered around the idea of religious certainty\u2026was certainty.\n\nWhat these thinkers DID, Nietzsche says, is throw out the religious certainty that caused them so many problems in the past and just changed the criteria for what makes something certain. RATIONALITY is now our path to certainty. They replaced one dogma with another dogma. So what happened was with each progressive classical rationalist philosopher doing their work\u2026 we seemed to be coming to terms with how everything in the universe fit neatly into rational categories. We were FINALLY understanding the truth after all those years. With every progressive scientific experiment that was UNDENIABLY bringing us an understanding of the natural world that improved the lives of people\u2026how could any reasonable person say that the process of science wasn\u2019t accessing something of the TRUTH about reality.\nBut then hundreds of years go by\u2026and as the goals of the Enlightenment are played out, problems start to arise and this dynamic starts to produce philosophers that want to understand the limitations of classical rational thought. One of the first major ones that gives rise to this trend was Kierkegaard.\n\nKierkegaard has a quote and I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but he says here are all these philosophers and scientists of his time that understand the deepest levels of reality and existence\u2026and here he is and he can\u2019t even understand Abraham. What he\u2019s saying is science and rationality during his time is supposedly producing some of the most comprehensive understanding of reality that we\u2019ve ever had\u2026but when it comes to certain aspects of what it means to be a human being\u2026rationality just can not help you, it\u2019s not a useful tool in that context. So many things about your life on an every day level\u2026human existence is FILLED with paradox. There are times in our lives, and he gives examples from the life of Abraham, there are times when continuing to live in the FACE of that paradox\u2026REQUIRES irrationality. Kierkegaard thinks this irrationality is an important part of our existence\u2026JUST AS IMPORTANT as rationality\u2026and if you ever tried to swear off irrationality completely and make purely rational choices all the time\u2026you\u2019d be left in a state of total paralysis.\n\nMaybe a good metaphor for this is to think what it would be like to look at the contents of a book that tried to tell you in 300 pages\u2026 how to be a person\u2026a field manual for life. Better yet, picture having a book that is supposed to tell you how to raise a child\u2026right? You open it up\u2026 and it\u2019s filled with math equations, syllogisms, geometric breakdowns of the nursery\u2026for anyone that\u2019s ever actually raised a child before\u2026you know how tremendously oversimplified something like that would HAVE to be. Now, the intent of the author may have been to arrive at a NEW level of certainty about raising our children\u2026you know, let\u2019s dare to think for ourselves! Remove ourselves from the tutelage of the parenting dogma of the past\u2026but the best intentions in the world don\u2019t change the fact that there is something missing there. There is something about being a human being that\u2019s lost when we\u2019re using purely using rational analysis to try to explain it. More than that\u2026no matter how much scientific progress we are making\u2026the tools we use to catalog that scientific data\u2026the means of analysis aren\u2019t even remotely similar to the way we experience reality.\n\nPerfect example to describe this phenomena used in the work of Professor Lloyd Kramer. So take time for example. There\u2019s this thing about the universe that we call time. We want to use rational analysis to understand it better. So we measure it, record and study it through the use of tools of rational analysis called clocks. Now for a clock\u2026seconds are uniform. 60 seconds in a minute. 60 minutes in an hour. So on and so forth. Time\u2026when viewed purely through the lens of rational analysis\u2026looks like that. But what is our actual, human experience of time? Well sometimes\u2026 time flies. Sometimes a few seconds of something agonizing can feel like an hour. The point is: when it comes to understanding the universe clocks might be the ultimate tool, but when it comes to understanding aspects of our human experience of the universe\u2026the tool of rational analysis just cannot tell the full story.\n\nSo Kierkegaard becomes a symbol for a fracture in this idea\u2026that starts to seem like a pretty extreme idea that rationality is going to be able to provide us with an exhaustive understanding of everything, but people might argue back to that\u2026look, maybe there are things about being a person that aren\u2019t entirely rational\u2026but informing every decision you make shouldn\u2019t be the GOAL of rationality anyway. The truth that science gives us about the natural world\u2026THAT\u2019S the goal here. THAT\u2019S the thing we have certain access to through reason. Rationality is going to give you the most accurate information about how things are that\u2019s available\u2026and then it\u2019s YOUR job to go out and actually DO something with that information.\n\nWell Kierkegaard was just the beginning. This critical look at reason that would eventually lead to the malaise of the early 20th century began to be critical of the scientific method as well\u2026more specifically a few important questions\u2026when we arrive at a scientific understanding about something\u2026and that understanding allows us to manipulate the natural world to benefit people\u2026can we say that science is accessing the objective, TRUTH of reality? What I mean is: can we say\u2026 that science is at least IN SOME WAY communicating with SOME intrinsic structure of the universe? After all, why would it be so repeatable in a lab setting if it weren\u2019t? Sure, maybe our understanding of it isn\u2019t exhaustive, we still have many more years ahead of us to conduct more science\u2026but there must at least be SOMETHING about the truth that we\u2019re touching there.\n\nBut on the other hand when philosophers started asking these questions about what we\u2019re REALLY doing when we conduct science\u2026what they started to realize is that there are aspects of science that are inextricably relative to the culture the science is produced in.\n\nThe best way I\u2019ve ever seen this dynamic explained is by the philosopher Richard Rorty\u2026so I\u2019ll try to summarize his main points the best I can: think of the birth, existence and reproduction of scientific ideas the same way you would think about the birth, existence and reproduction of species in terms of Natural Selection.\n\nSo for thousands of years it was believed that the universe was designed by a Grand Designer\u2026and there were many arguments philosophers had for this\u2026not the least of which was just LOOK AROUND. How convenient that I drink water and there\u2019s water around. That I exist in this very small range of temperatures and weather patterns, and that\u2019s exactly what the world is around me. The point was: How could you NOT THINK this was a celestial hamster cage designed with your survival in mind? For thousands of years THAT WAS THE DEFAULT\u2026sure, you had the sporadic thinker that came along and questioned it, but the onus was on THEM to prove why this theory had any merit that was so contrary to our deepest intuitions about reality.\n\nWell you know the story: Natural Selection offered an alternative\u2026this was a theory that explained how things could SEEM perfectly designed for the environments they were in, but the reality was just that all the beings that DIDN\u2019T correspond with the environment died before reproducing.\n\nWell scientific ideas exist in an environment as well. That is, the set of scientific and cultural biases that they were produced in. The scientific theories that correspond with these biases subsist, they\u2019re rewarded with tenure, they may manage to reproduce.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense in which if a slightly different culture had come to pass\u2026the way we scientifically understand things would change as well. There\u2019s a sense in which if a COMPLETELY different culture had come to pass\u2026just as different creatures would have been able to gain tenure in a changed environment\u2026a completely different way of scientifically categorizing the world could have emerged. So this in no way takes away from the utility of scientific ideas, but this does start to raise a very important question to the thinkers during the late 19th century\u2026Rorty puts it this way:\n\n\u201cAre the longest lasting and most frequently relied upon theories stable because they match a stable reality? Or because scientists get together to keep them stable, as politicians get together to keep existing political arrangements intact?\u201d\n\nThe answer to this question makes a giant difference when it comes to how you view the findings of science. The difference the answer to this question makes is actually very similar to the way postmodernity looked at the history of philosophy in our series on Gilles Deleuze. What is philosophy? Well it\u2019s not an act of discovery\u2026it\u2019s an act of creation. In other words, philosophers when doing their work are not discovering the intrinsic structure of the universe\u2026reality is far too chaotic to ever be able to do that\u2026the more accurate analysis of what\u2019s going on would be that philosophy is an act of creation\u2026philosophers create systems of concepts to give us one VERSION of reality\u2026one perspective that might be useful.\n\nWell a very similar charge is being leveled here about the history of science. Science is not DISCOVERING and ACCESSING the intrinsic structure of the universe\u2026science is CREATING one version of understanding what we have access to\u2026and this understanding is ALWAYS relative to the perspective of the observer which is ALWAYS a person\u2026 who is also embedded in a set of cultural biases and a current set of presuppositions that the science of their time accepts and proceeds from.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a philosopher in the early 20th century that happens to see science in this way\u2026the impact this has on how you view essentially the last 200 years of western democracy becomes horrifying. Because they instantly realize that this problem they have with science is in actuality a problem with reason itself.\n\nSo at this point in the story Rationality itself starts comes under fire\u2026and some of these critiques are actually reworkings of OLDER critiques of reason\u2026for example Edmund Burke spoke several times about how when it comes to the progression of human thought, but more specifically when it comes to how we should structure societies\u2026you never want to fully commit your strategy to Rational analysis. He gives many reasons not to but one of the big ones he would say is that\u2026look, when you decide you\u2019re going to determine which thoughts are legitimate or not based on purely rational analysis\u2026what you see when you actually put that into practice is that you can basically find a way to rationalize anything.\n\nLook no further than your own personal life for proof of this fact. How many times have you reasoned to a conclusion about something and still been wrong? Maybe you know somebody who made a big mistake in their life and after the fact they thought about what happened and they\u2019ve found a million ways to rationalize it to themselves and others and it all makes perfect sense to everyone\u2026but nonetheless its obvious to everyone that they\u2019ve still made a huge mistake.\n\nSee this is an important distinction to draw about rational analysis. When it comes to your personal life if you decide to take a purely rational approach to something and end up with problems it\u2019s no big deal. You\u2019re only hurting yourself. But on a societal level SHOULD we be using a purely rational approach when it comes to determining the legitimacy of thoughts? The bigger question that concerns this debate between these two groups: should thoughts be considered to be accessing the intrinsic structure of the universe simply because they correspond with human reason?\n\nHuman reason is always doing its work within the parameters of human ignorance. And that, human\u2026that\u2019s omnipresent throughout this whole process\u2026is always subject\u2026 to cultural limitations. Just like we experience time and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re a bunch of giant clocks walking around\u2026our experience of time is relative to the perspective of the observer\u2026here are philosophers in the early 20th century saying that reason\u2026and the criteria for what makes something reasonable or not are ALSO relative to the observer.\n\nNow it should be said: NOBODY\u2026not EITHER SIDE\u2026is trying to do away with reason. Nobody\u2019s trying to do away with science. They\u2019re trying to do away with what they see as dogma or the idea that what reason and science provides is access to certainty. This is why Nietzsche thought people like Kant at the beginning of the Enlightenment missed a big opportunity\u2026that could\u2019ve been the moment\u2026 when they realized that certainty about things\u2026 shouldn\u2019t have ever been the goal in the first place. We should VALUE reason, we should VALUE science\u2026but not deify them\u2026we should understand them for what they are: they\u2019re not discovering anything\u2026they\u2019re CREATING something. That subtle distinction may not seem like much, but it actually has massive effects on how things play out in the world\u2026and this is ultimately why people CARE so much.\n\nBecause if you\u2019re one of the philosophers in the early 20th century that thinks reason and science are relative to the culture they are conducted in and NOT objectivity\u2026then one of the first critiques you have to have about the Enlightenment is that the Age of Reason might have been a horrifying period in history where we used Reason to justify cultural imperialism.\n\nBecause when reason becomes something that\u2019s capitalized\u2026then it becomes the standard against which every society is judged. See, to these critics\u2026what happened at the beginning of the Enlightenment is we made this bold proclamation that the way to organize the relationship between government and citizen should be determined by reason. This marks a major shift not only in the way the western world typically structured their states, but also in how the citizen saw their role in the political process. This is the birth of the individual in modern western culture. We\u2019ll talk about it more on next episode when we go deeper into the work of Leo Struass, but essentially this is the moment when societies in the west move away from teleologies and societal roles and move instead towards rational individualism. This is yet ANOTHER criticism of the Age of Reason from around this time period\u2026that Rationalism when applied to the political process necessarily moves thinking towards a focus on the individual\u2026and that it\u2019s THIS SHIFT towards the individual person as the focal point that\u2019s responsible for a centuries long progression of people becoming more and more narcissistic and self centered\u2026but again, we\u2019ll talk more about that next episode.\n\nBack to the primary point though: Rationality, to these critics, LEADS to cultural imperialism when applied at a societal level. Because if rationality is relative to the culture it\u2019s being used in\u2026and things like rational debates are the way that we determine political legitimacy\u2026then what the goals of the Enlightenment produce are societies that appoint themselves as judge, jury and executioner of the rest of the world based on narrow parameters. Think about it: THEY get to decide the definition of what\u2019s \u201crational\u201d or \u201cirrational\u201d based on their own cultural makeup\u2026and THEN they get to slap on their world police badge and be the moral arbiter of everyone else. The rest of the world constantly under this magnifying glass of their version of Rationality\u2026the default way to view all other cultures becomes comparing them to this Rational ideal\u2026how much do they deviate from the ideal society that WE\u2019VE determined the values of? THAT becomes the new question when dealing with other cultures\u2026knowing that if any point a culture becomes TOO \u201cirrational\u201d in how they set up their society\u2026Rationality can ALSO become the justification for invading.\n\nSee\u2026 that\u2019s ALSO one of the problems early 20th century thinkers were starting to have with Reason. Reason as it turns out is not this sort of ahistorical, acultural objective tool Youfor arriving at facts about things. The results of rational analysis were varying to such a large extent\u2026societies were using the guise of reason to justify such massively different conclusions\u2026these philosophers started to realize that David Hume may have been right all along: Hume\u2019s Fork, Hume\u2019s Guillotine as it\u2019s often called\u2026the central thesis being that you cannot possibly derive an ought from an is.\n\nNo matter how optimistic thinkers were at the beginning of the Enlightnment\u2026no matter how much they thought Reason could eventually provide us with Objective Morality\u2026the more that science and rationality were left to do their work\u2026the more it became clear to these thinkers in the early 20th century that it was never going to happen. The more the political process focused on the individual and tried to use the results of science to arrive at values about how to structure our societies and how people fit into them\u2026the more the goals of the Enlightenment were left to play out the more it became clear that when you force reason to try to come up with objective values about ANYTHING\u2026you\u2019re doomed to failure. Because, to these thinkers, that\u2019s just not what rational analysis is capable of doing.\n\nSee that\u2019s the problem here\u2026Rational analysis can CREATE values\u2026because rational analysis always has cultural values embedded into it\u2026but in order to justify any sort of values it needs to use the results of science\u2026and modern science HAS to assume value neutrality. This became a big problem for modernity. This became the fate of science in the early 20th century political landscape. Science cannot provide us with any values on its own\u2026the only thing it can do is serve as a tool\u2026 to justify values that are smuggled into it by culture\u2026all while wearing that costume of value neutrality.\nThis will be another thing we expand on moving forward with our series on 20th century political philosophy\u2026the goal of this episode is to put you in the shoes of one of these early 20th century political thinkers and understand WHY so many of them were having such a problem with the legacy of the Enlightenment. Despite having not put out an episode in a while\u2026I\u2019m actually pretty deep into the writing phase of this entire series\u2026that front loaded work is actually WHY I haven\u2019t put something out for a while; not my health for once. So that\u2019s good news, I guess. But I just wanted to say that when I considered trying to tie together a cohesive story of where we\u2019re going over the century\u2026I felt this episode was necessary.\n\nMaybe the best place to end today is back in Ancient Greece. You know\u2026this tension between postmodernity and modernity just saturates our modern discourse. Seems like you can\u2019t turn on any form of media for more than five minutes without being faced with some reminder of this battle that\u2019s going on. It\u2019s actually pretty amazing to see\u2026think of how lucky you are that at any moment you can turn on a screen and watch two people argue with each other that are living in completely different universes. Pretty cool stuff, and this battle is often cited by people in the media as a bad thing for society. They say this is a sign we\u2019re living in some pretty dark times. Some people go so far as to say this is a catastrophe\u2026the likes of which the world has never seen. When people can\u2019t even agree on some of the most basic ideas that make up their world views\u2026how can we even have a conversation with each other? Could this series of disagreements spell the end of Western Civilization?\nSome people may say yes. There are a lot of philosophers out there who would say no. This isn\u2019t the end of the world. This isn\u2019t some unprecedented existential threat\u2026this isn\u2019t even a new disagreement between people.\n\nRemember in Plato\u2019s dialogues back in the Athenian Agora\u2026this battle was going on between heavyweights in the western world all the way back then. One corner you had Protagoras, Godfather of relativism, Man is the measure of all things, the other corner you had Socrates, largely a mouthpiece for Plato\u2019s ideas but him arguing for the idea that No, there MUST BE some sort of intrinsic structure to the universe that we can access\u2026and rational debate is the absolute best tool we have to get there.\n\nSome philosophers would say that this argument is nothing new\u2026this has been going on for thousands of years. This very well may be one of those debates that will NEVER have a winner. This may be one of those questions that causes arguments on the news for as long as humanity\u2019s around to have news programs to argue on.\n\nCultures will ebb and flow with any one time period\u2019s answer to this question. One side of this may win out for a while\u2026we may have a long period where we believe in the power of FAITH to arrive at the objective truth\u2026or the power of REASON to arrive at the objective. The OTHER side may win out for a while\u2026we may have long periods of historicism, relativism, nihilism. Some philosophers would say there are pros and cons to EITHER side gaining a greater level of cultural control and that we should just try to understand the times we\u2019re living in. The point is: some would say that there are many things that may sink the ship of Western Civilization\u2026but this is not going to be it. People have been arguing about this stuff in one form or another for thousands of years\u2026maybe cultures DO ebb and flow in their answers to this question\u2026and maybe if the popular view is that we are\u00a0currently embroiled in a culture of rampant subjectivity and relativism\u2026maybe the thing we should all be looking out for is: what will be the NEXT THING to stake its claim to the objective truth?\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}, "episode_102": {"date": "2019-10-8", "text": "Posted on October 8, 2019\nEpisode 135 \u2013 Transcript\n\nThis is a transcript of episode #135 on Leo Strauss. Check out the episode page HERE.\n\nSo picking up from where we left off last episode\u2026there\u2019s a strong contingency of philosophers living in the early 20th century that have grown increasingly dissatisfied with rationality as a guide for arriving at certainty about things. They feel this way for a number of different reasons\u2026 but it should be emphasized that their critique of rationality was not the only side of the story here. Like any good philosophical critique\u2026 sometimes questioning something can\u2019t offer a sense of clarity for any real length of time\u2026sometimes when the critique is good enough\u2026when we ask questions\u2026it just leads us to more questions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis was definitely the case in the early 20th century\u2026you know\u2026speaking of strong contingencies there\u2019s ALSO gotta be a strong contingency of people listening to the last episode of the show\u2026living as the beneficiaries of the last 100 years of human thought\u2026who found themselves a little frustrated with the critique of rational analysis overall. There must be some people out there who are willing to ask the extremely VALID question: what are we even supposed to DO with any of this information.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis person might say: Look, I hear all your criticisms of rationality, and lets SAY, for the sake of the conversation, let\u2019s say that EVERYTHING you\u2019re saying is an amazing point that needs to be taken into consideration\u2026well don\u2019t we still need to have a working arrangement with the reality we live in? Don\u2019t we still need SOME METHOD of determining what\u2019s going on vs what\u2019s NOT going on? What\u2019s the plan? I mean, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to throw out rationalism now? Buy everyone a magic 8 ball and say \u201cstart shakin\u2019 everybody!\u201d What\u2019s the plan here?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot to mention, let\u2019s look at the entire basis of your critique of rationality for a second here\u2026uh, Got a few problems\u2026I mean, for one\u2026you\u2019re USING rational analysis\u2026to critique\u2026rational analysis. How you gonna reconcile that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause that\u2019s the thing: maybe we DO run into problems the minute we try to use rationality as a tool to arrive at certainty, but none of these criticisms has adequately made a case that reason isn\u2019t the best thing we have going for us\u2026.and they CERTAINLY haven\u2019t made a case for some alternative that\u2019s better. See if rationality is a tool that we have in our toolbox, the early 20th century wants to show us that it\u2019s not the only tool we have and it\u2019s not a universal tool that you should use for every task you have. But none of that is to say that there aren\u2019t specific areas where rational analysis isn\u2019t the best type of analysis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, some thinkers would come to say that maybe the most effective setting for the usage of rational analysis is at the sort of macro level of navigating the world. That in the same way in the quantum world there is a different set of rules that things seem to play by, and in response we need a different set of assumptions we proceed from in our analysis\u2026maybe at a societal level or at points in our internal experience of things rational analysis is less useful\u2026 but it is by far the best tool we have in the middle territory between those two extremes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the point: this is a baby bathwater situation here. We can\u2019t do away with reason entirely\u2026it\u2019s proven far too effective at producing SOMETHING that\u2019s extremely useful to us. The question is what exactly is that SOMETHING it\u2019s producing and how does its production fit into discourse at large?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother problem someone might have with this whole critique is that the unintended flip side of critiquing reason\u2026 is that the enemy of my enemy unintentionally becomes my friend. What I mean is: showing the limitations of reason was for these philosophers in the early 20th century an attempt to dispel dogma\u2026but as you can imagine\u2026 these arguments can easily become ammunition for any extremist group to drum up support for their cause, all the while not having to conform to the bounds of reason.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen thinkers in the early 20th century were faced with all these questions\u2026There were a lot of different responses. But it\u2019s important to note that virtually NONE of these responses had anything to do with throwing out reason in its entirety. When someone says something like, Rational analysis doesn\u2019t produce certainty\u2026so let\u2019s throw it out and find something to replace it with\u2026that person is making the SAME MISTAKE the thinkers did at the beginning of the Enlightenment when they replaced faith based certainty with rational certainty. Remember\u2026these early 20th century thinkers weren\u2019t opponents of reason\u2026they were opponents of dogma\u2026and nothing showcases that fact better than considering how hard these thinkers worked to preserve reason moving forward\u2026and there may be NO philosopher MORE emblematic of this approach\u2026than the early 20th century thinker\u2026 Leo Strauss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLeo Strauss was a huge fan of rational analysis\u2026so it may seem contradictory to say that he also thought that the entire project of modernity was doomed to failure from the start. This may SEEM contradictory\u2026but let me explain why it\u2019s not\u2026and the story begins with his response to one of those critiques of rational analysis that we talked about last episode: the cultural contingency of reason.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen people say that reason is relative to the culture that\u2019s doing the reasoning\u2026limited to the cultural biases, limitations, the perspective of the observer, etc\u2026when people are making that case: a common thing they\u2019ll say is, well, look at ancient Greece. What was \u201creasonable\u201d in ancient Greece is MASSIVELY different that what we\u2019d call reasonable today. Their point being that clearly rationality is not some ahistorical, acultural tool for arriving at the objective truth about things\u2026what was rational in ancient Greece was relative to their own biases and limitations as a culture\u2026the ultimate point being that: we\u2019re no different.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow as a fan of rational analysis, Strauss doesn\u2019t REJECT that point\u2026instead he accepts it and he asks the question: well then what, does, that, mean\u2026 for how we should be using reason in our societies moving forward?\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, a concise way to sum up Strauss\u2019s answer to this question is: the fact that reason is relative to the culture it was produced in\u2026is not a WEAKNESS of reason at all\u2026it\u2019s actually a strength in his eyes. Strauss thinks: Rationality is not a lost cause just because it doesn\u2019t produce certainty\u2026what we should be doing\u2026he thinks is using the limitations of reason to the benefit of our societies\u2026because here\u2019s the thing, he would say: there are many\u2026MANY different elements to building and maintaining a society, and a SINGLE approach to rationality\u2026. may not be able to deal with all of them\u2026different societies have different strengths and weaknesses\u2026the rational approach of one society is going to be good at some things and bad at others\u2026another society\u2019s approach might be good and bad at other things.\u00a0He thinks our rationality\u2026the rationality of the Enlightenment\u2026did a lot of good\u2026 but it also has produced a lot of problems that are proving very difficult to solve simply with OUR VERSION of rationality\u2026Here\u2019s his idea: what if we used the societies of the past as a guide\u2026and returned to a different TYPE of rationality that can help us solve the problems that Enlightenment rationality has produced?\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo start building his case here\u2026what he\u2019d want us to do is consider the fact that there\u2019s a lot of people in our modern world that carry some pretty over-simplified views when it comes to the idea of progress, throughout history. There\u2019s this very popular idea\u2026that the entire history of the western world has been some sort of linear, constant progression that all culminates in this moment, right here. Societies have all built on the mistakes of the societies before them\u2026 and we are currently living in the PINNACLE of what humanity has ever achieved, now\u2026Strauss would say: that is absolutely TRUE\u2026 when you look at it in terms of a few specific, narrow markers. For instance, and for the sake of argument, modern medicine is just far more advanced than the medicine developed during the time of the ancient Greeks. The technology we have today\u2026is just far more advanced\u2026the level to which we can harness and manipulate the natural world to our benefit\u2026is just more advanced than back then. But Strauss would say if you ONLY looked at the idea of progress based on these criteria\u2026then you\u2019re putting a very charitable, modern bias on what the word PROGRESS really means. Progress\u2026he\u2019s going to say\u2026is a far more complex idea than just whether you have rocket ships and stem cells.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStrauss would ask do you think there are any areas of society where the rationality of Ancient Greece produced better results than our modern rationality? Well just to throw one out there to get the conversation started: how about the fact that ancient Greece produced a society\u2026 where there weren\u2019t masses of people desperately trying to find meaning? A society where it wasn\u2019t downright impossible for reasonable people to believe that their life had any sort of natural purpose that belonged to them? To feel any sort of connection to the universe or some grand design.\u00a0Think of the tragic ways that people often cope with this alienation of modernity\u2026and then Strauss would want us to consider that progress is not something that can be quantified by looking at just a few points of flourishing. Progress may be something with thousands of different components, cultures throughout the years ebbing and flowing, progressing and regressing in different ways based on what each individual culture decided to focus their efforts on. The question Strauss would want to ask is: what has modernity focused its efforts upon\u2026what areas are we great at, what areas are we lacking in\u2026how did it get this way, and how might the cultures of the past help us understand ourselves better? This whole line of investigation that we\u2019re talking about\u2026Strauss often refers to it as thinking of history in terms of a contrast between the different approaches utilized by the ancients\u2026vs the moderns. Ancients vs. Moderns\u2026OR another way of thinking of that same distinction that\u2019s going to be very useful to us is to think about the Ancients vs the Moderns as the IDEAL vs the REAL. Let me explain what Strauss means.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the project of modernity began\u2026our scientific method ASSUMED value-neutrality. In other words, we assumed NOTHING about things like the origins of the universe\u2026the purposes of things\u2026you know, WHY a volcano is what it is doesn\u2019t really matter when conducting modern science\u2026the job of modern science is to observe and describe WHAT there is\u2026not why it\u2019s there\u2026now contrast that with the ancient Greeks\u2026 who used the Aristotelean scientific method\u2026a scientific method that assumes the existence of final causes. In other words when conducting science, and doing ANY sort of rational analysis for that matter\u2026the ancient Greeks proceeded from the assumption that there ARE purposes to things in the universe, and that they must fit together in some sort of orderly way. Another way of putting this would be to say that the scientific method of modernity concerns itself with the REAL\u2026it tries to assume no values and get to the bottom of the true nature of reality\u2026whereas the scientific method of the Ancient Greeks concerns itself with accessing the IDEAL\u2026or finding the different categories of existence and how they relate to teleologies that exist in a larger ordered universe. Moderns focused on the REAL the ancients on the IDEAL.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example of the ancients moderns ideal real situation here\u2026 we\u2019ll start with the ancient Greeks this time. When the ancient Greeks apply their culture\u2019s version of rationality to the task of building a state\u2026living in a universe that assumes the existence of final causes and teleologies\u2026the RATIONAL thing to assume at that point becomes that there must be some sort of IDEAL version of a state that we can arrive at if only we reason about it long enough. From there, it\u2019s reasonable to assume, there must be some sort of ideal STRUCTURE to that state. From there there\u2019s an ideal way to be a ruler\u2026a government official, a warrior, an artisan\u2026from there there\u2019s an ideal way to be a citizen of a state more generally\u2026there\u2019s an ideal way to be a friend, to be a partner, to be a sister, there\u2019s an ideal way to be a person beyond that, if only we use rational analysis to look at it closely enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, when someone is BORN into one of these societies\u2026when they\u2019re growing up and learn about the way the universe is\u2026they INSTANTLY have a couple dozen ideals of purpose that they can be striving towards\u2026and by ideal the Greeks didn\u2019t mean some sort of transcendent thing where you\u2019ll start glowing once you finally reach it\u2026no, you\u2019re NEVER going to reach these ideals\u2026and that\u2019s not the point anyway\u2026the point of these ideals was to serve as moral sages for people and societies to strive towards. So even though they talked about things like ideal societies, or rulers or even something like being an ideal friend\u2026nobody REALLY thought they were ever going to achieve the IDEAL society one day\u2026.the point\u2026 was that society itself\u2026 was structured around virtue. We have these ideals that we will never actually reach, but we will nonetheless try our best every day to get as close as we possibly can to them. The point of these ideals, Strauss tells us, was the process\u2026and this process was in many ways a governing influence for ancient Greece.\n\n\u00a0\n\nContrast this with the value-neutrality of modernity. When the project of modernity begins and the gauntlet of the Enlightenment is thrown down\u2026we start structuring our societies around the idea of rational individual self-interest. In other words..once modernity comes around\u2026we are no longer gonna be structuring our societies around virtue\u2026we\u2019re no longer aiming for some ideal society or some ideal citizen OF that society. We don\u2019t believe in final causes anymore\u2026so instead of trying to construct an ideal state\u2026we decide we want to create what you could call a \u201cREAL\u201d state\u2026REAL in the sense that it\u2019s something we can ACTUALLY design and implement\u2026and then put systems in place that ensure it will stay that way. When you have people constantly striving to be the best ruler or citizen they possibly can\u2026things can take care of themselves most of the time\u2026but modernity didn\u2019t have that luxury\u2026when you assume no values written into the universe and then build your political system from there\u2026you need to construct safeguards like the legal system and constitutions to ensure that even when you DON\u2019T have a virtuous ruler or citizenry\u2026the society still will exist at a certain standard.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo create things like a legal system or a constitution without assuming any values written into the cosmos required modernity to base this new political tradition on the rational, self-interest of the individual. People no longer fall into a clear role or ideal within the structure of a society\u2026no, people are individuals now\u2026when I decide to participate as a citizen in a society\u2026 I\u2019m not doing that because, you know, man is a political animal at the level of the universe..when I decide to be in coalition with other individuals I do so solely because it benefits me to, it is in my rational self-interest to be a part of society.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStrauss would say that this political strategy of modernity has proven to be a giant mistake for western civilization. Because the problem with assuming value-neutrality\u2026and then building an entire political tradition on top of it\u2026is that the political realm NEEDS VALUES to be able to make decisions about things\u2026things like how should our society be? How should we treat our citizens? Where is our society headed? Strauss thinks the Enlightenment leaves us with no real answers to these questions\u2026and what eventually happens is we\u2019re left with no values and the entire project of modernity begins to consume itself. The modern political tradition cannot work the way it was designed to work if its left to play out long enough\u2026left to play out to its natural ends\u2026modernity will always, and unavoidably lead us to Strauss\u2019s collection of a bunch of really bad isms that we ultimately need to look to for our values.\n\nModernity eventually always leads to either relativism\u2026or meaning being something that is entirely relative, which doesn\u2019t give political institutions much guidance\u2026historicism\u2026or meaning being derived from whatever historical context we happen to be in\u2026scientism or meaning being deferred to the sciences\u2026economism or meaning coming from economic matters\u2026or lastly Nihilism\u2026which in casual conversation may look like someone drinking themselves to sleep every night\u2026in THIS context it just goes one step further\u2026if there is no intrinsic meaning to anything in the universe\u2026then hings STILL seem to have meaning to us in the world\u2026where does that meaning come from? Power dynamics for Nihilism\u2026when you control the discourse surrounding a topic you control the meaning that surrounds that topic.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese five things: relativism, historicism, scientism, economism and nihilism are the endgame for modernity\u2026every single time for Strauss. When you try to build a political tradition on top of a foundation where you\u2019ve tried to be entirely value neutral\u2026the Enlightenment political tradition eventually HAS TO consume itself. Which can make you wonder why this new political tradition has lasted as long as it has without devolving into relativism all the way back in the 1700s\u2026.Strauss would say the only reason it\u2019s lasted THIS long\u2026is because we initially carried over an enormous amount of baggage from the days where we believed in teleologies and final causes, from the days when values were POSSIBLE in a political tradition\u2026but if you leave modernity to it\u2019s own devices\u2026given enough time to play out\u2026these five isms and all of the political turmoil that spawned out of them in the early 20th century was ALWAYS going to be the outcome.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee, to Strauss, even things that masquerade as enlightenment political values always lead to this outcome\u2026take Enlightenment era Liberalism for instance\u2026.Strauss would say it is no coincidence\u2026that modern liberalism has an ethos where it aims towards multiculturalism and acceptance of all ideas no matter how outside the box they are\u2026and the fact that relativism was the ultimate destination for the modern political process. The liberalism of the Enlightenment, to Strauss, inextricably LEADS to relativism\u2026which then leads to different forms of Nihilism\u2026not the least of which may in some extreme cases lead to Tyranny. He makes a case that the agenda of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany in many ways is an expression of the thought of the Enlightenment\u2026because similar TO the Enlightenment their chief aim was to do away with the existing traditions and values and replace them instead with a power structure under which the universe could be controlled\u2026or at least SEEM to be controlled.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ultimate point is that political institutions NEED values in order to make decisions\u2026and because of this fact\u2026to Strauss, the relativism of modernity can not ever last for very long, or else that relativistic void where there are no values\u2026will come to be replaced by something. Whether that something is Nazi Germany or a value system that WE decide to implement\u2026is really up to us. This is WHY Strauss thinks the solution is to return to a political process that more resembles the one devised by the ancient Greeks\u2026a political process embedded with values that can actually inform us as to how society should be structured\u2026and how citizens should fit into that society. This is an example, Strauss thinks, of how the rational approach of the ancients did something a LOT MORE EFFECTIVELY than the rational approach of the moderns. Maybe it\u2019s time we start looking at OTHER FORMS of rationality to find solutions to the problems OUR VERSION of rationality has caused.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStrauss talks at one point about how in one reading of Plato\u2026the Greeks seem to have been fully aware of the possibility of the experiment of the Enlightenment\u2026and they seem to have been fully aware as to how it would all play out\u2026he says at one point Plato seriously considers implementing something extremely similar to our modern scientific method\u2026but ultimately decides against it because the end result would be that it would rob human beings of their identity and values. The trade off just wasn\u2019t worth it to Plato.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe most important question we need to answer at the beginning of the 20th century\u2026is what do we base the values of our political system upon\u2026.what Leo Strauss is ultimately saying is: when you pay attention to answers Modernity is ACTUALLY giving us to this question\u2026the silence is deafening. We may have made tons of progress in Agricultural science so that far fewer people need to go hungry\u2026but we shouldn\u2019t stand by satisfied with scientific progress\u2026 while the entire western world lives through the greatest famine to date when it comes to meaning and values.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore generally than that though\u2026what good is having all the bombs, tanks and artillery in the world if you have no values to direct how they should be used? You\u2019re just waiting for a third party to step in and impose it\u2019s values and use that destructive power however they deem fit. Strauss would say this political landscape at the beginning of the 20th century, the situation modernity has created for us\u2026is primed for nationalism. We\u2019ll see how that plays out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut at the center of this whole discussion is this classic Strauss divide between the ancients and the moderns. Societies focused on the ideal\u2026vs societies focused on the real. You may wonder why someone so interested in the political realm spent so much of his time engaging in philosophy. Well if you asked Strauss what the value of philosophy was\u2026like a lot of his world view, he\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be satisfied by the answers that have been given to us by modernity\u2026and he thinks there is a lot of clarity to be found by going back and seeing how the ancients would have answered that same question.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPhilosophy, during the time of the ancients, was not seen as an academic institution. There were no multi-volume sets to be read\u2026there were no terms to memorize\u2026philosophy all the way back then\u2026was a way of life. Philosophy was an attitude towards your disposition as a human being. Being a philosopher wasn\u2019t about the degrees hanging on your wall or sounding smart at parties\u2026being a philosopher was about a quest that you were on. Strauss wants us to consider\u2026what exactly was that quest that philosophers used to be on? What were they trying to accomplish by conducting philosophy?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe answer Strauss gives is that during the time of the ancients philosophers used to be on a quest to discover knowledge\u2026of the whole\u2026as opposed to knowledge of individual particular things. Philosophers don\u2019t much care about particulars\u2026they care about categories of things and how those categories relate to the whole. Now\u2026as we talked about\u2026the Greeks\u2026were extremely skeptical of humanities ability to ever be able to arrive at knowledge of the whole. Knowledge of the whole is the ideal that they\u2019re striving towards that they\u2019re never going to get to\u2026modern science\u2026while nobody\u2019s saying that we\u2019re for sure ever going to get there\u2026the AMBITION of modern science requires, and believes at least in theory\u2026that knowledge of the whole is something we might just arrive at one day. This difference is in MANY WAYS THE DIFFERENCE between the ancient focus on the ideal and the modern focus on the real.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe value of philosophy, to Strauss, is in the pursuit towards an ideal. In the same way other professions may strive for perfection, but have to come to accept that they will never actually reach it\u2026philosophers live their lives in pursuit of knowledge of the whole, but to Strauss, what they will have to come to accept is that the understanding of the universe, the clarity that they want so badly\u2026is just always going to elude them. But that shouldn\u2019t matter\u2026says Strauss. The value of philosophy doesn\u2019t lie in the results it produces\u2026but in the process you\u2019re engaging in. Philosophy is valuable as a way of life\u2026because unlike every other way of life out there it requires you to resist that all too human tendency\u2026to oversimplify, lie to yourself, make excuses, whatever you have to do to convince yourself that you\u2019ve arrived at a solution about things. Solutions\u2026don\u2019t exist except in the minds of people that are hungry for them. Philosophy as a way of life\u2026doesn\u2019t allow for this level of dishonesty\u2026and to Strauss that is a big part of it\u2019s value. He says be a philosopher. Live philosophy as a way of life\u2026but understand when it comes down to it all that really means, to live life as a philosopher, is to have a genuine awareness of the problems that surround you. But THEN what\u2019s gonna happen, he says, once you\u2019re aware of the problems\u2026is you\u2019re naturally going to be inclined towards finding a SOLUTION to those problems. But beware of this place, he would say\u2026because the moment you decide that your \u201csolutions\u201d to the problems become more real to you than your awareness of how problematic the idea of a solution REALLY IS\u2026THAT is when you cease to be a philosopher\u2026that\u2019s when THIS happens\n\nas he puts it:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYet as long as there is no wisdom but only quest for wisdom, the evidence of all solutions is necessarily smaller than the evidence of the problems. Therefore the philosopher ceases to be a philosopher at the moment at which the \u2018subjective certainty\u2019 [quoting M. Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve] of a solution becomes stronger than his awareness of the problematic character of that solution. At that moment the sectarian is born.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\n\nWritten by\nStephen West\nPosted in\nTranscript"}}
